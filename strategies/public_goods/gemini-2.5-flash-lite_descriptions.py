This is a fascinating setup for a repeated Public Goods Game! The core challenge lies in incentivizing cooperation when individual defection is often the dominant strategy in a single round. My proposed cooperative strategy aims to balance the potential for high collective payoffs with the risk of exploitation.

Here's the strategy, which I'll call the **"Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation" (ARC)** strategy:

**Core Philosophy:** The ARC strategy is fundamentally cooperative but employs a mechanism of reciprocity to punish defection and reward sustained cooperation. It learns from past interactions and adapts its behavior to encourage a high level of cooperation in the long run.

---

### ARC Strategy Design:

**1. Decision Rules:**

The decision for player `i` in round `t` depends on the observed behavior of *all* players in the previous round `t-1`.

*   **Initial Cooperation (Round 1):** In the very first round, player `i` will **Cooperate (C)**. This is a bold but essential move to signal a willingness to cooperate and initiate the potential for high collective payoffs.

*   **Reciprocal Cooperation (Round t > 1):** In any round `t` greater than 1, player `i` will **Cooperate (C)** *if and only if* all other `n-1` players cooperated in round `t-1`.

*   **Conditional Defection (Round t > 1):** If *any* player (including potentially player `i` itself, though the strategy aims to avoid this) defected in round `t-1`, player `i` will **Defect (D)** in round `t`. This serves as a punishment for the group's failure to achieve full cooperation in the previous round.

*   **Re-engagement after Defection:** If player `i` defected in round `t-1`, in round `t`, player `i` will **Cooperate (C)** *only if* all other `n-1` players also defected in round `t-1`. This is a special condition to allow for a reset and attempt to re-establish cooperation after a round of widespread defection. If player `i` defected and *not* all others defected, player `i` will continue to defect.

**Summary of Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1:** Always Cooperate (C).
*   **Round t > 1:**
    *   If ALL players (including self) cooperated in round `t-1`: Cooperate (C).
    *   If ANY player defected in round `t-1`:
        *   If player `i` defected in `t-1` AND ALL players defected in `t-1`: Cooperate (C) to attempt a reset.
        *   Otherwise (player `i` defected, or player `i` cooperated but others defected): Defect (D).

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t=1):** As stated, always Cooperate (C). This is crucial for setting a cooperative tone.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** The strategy does **not** explicitly treat the last round differently. The logic remains the same. This is because in repeated games with a known, finite number of rounds, there's often a "last round problem" where players might revert to defection. By not signaling an end-game defection, ARC hopes to sustain cooperation until the very end, or at least punish deviations effectively up to the last moment. If cooperation collapses due to defection, the strategy will naturally shift to defection for the final round(s).
*   **No Prior History (Round 1):** Handled by the initial cooperation rule.
*   **Game Parameters (n, k, r):** The strategy is designed to be agnostic to the specific numerical values of `n`, `k`, and `r`, as long as they adhere to the game's constraints. The logic scales and adapts to the group size and payoff structure implicitly. The constraint `1 < k < n` is important because it means that full cooperation yields a higher individual payoff than full defection (2 vs 1 in the example), making cooperation potentially beneficial.

**3. Being Cooperative:**

The ARC strategy is inherently cooperative in its intention and its initial action. It actively seeks to achieve the highest possible collective payoff by encouraging full cooperation. The retaliatory defection is not an act of malice but a strategic tool to disincentivize selfish behavior that would otherwise lead to the suboptimal outcome of universal defection. The "re-engagement after defection" rule is a crucial cooperative element, providing a path back to mutual benefit even after a breakdown.

### Pseudocode for ARC Strategy:

```pseudocode
// Player i's strategy for round t

// Store the history of actions for all players in previous rounds
// history = a list of lists, where history[t-1] = [action_1, action_2, ..., action_n] for round t-1
// action can be 'C' or 'D'

function decide_action(round_number, n, k, r, history, player_id):
    // Initialize player_id's action to 'D' as a default
    my_action = 'D'

    if round_number == 1:
        // Always cooperate in the first round
        my_action = 'C'
    else:
        // Get actions from the previous round
        previous_round_actions = history[round_number - 2] // Adjust index for 0-based history

        // Check if all players cooperated in the previous round
        all_cooperated_last_round = true
        for action in previous_round_actions:
            if action == 'D':
                all_cooperated_last_round = false
                break

        if all_cooperated_last_round:
            // If everyone cooperated last round, we cooperate this round
            my_action = 'C'
        else:
            // If at least one player defected last round, we need to decide
            my_action_last_round = previous_round_actions[player_id - 1] // Get my own action from last round

            // Check if ALL players defected in the previous round
            all_defected_last_round = true
            for action in previous_round_actions:
                if action == 'C':
                    all_defected_last_round = false
                    break

            if my_action_last_round == 'D' and all_defected_last_round:
                // If I defected, AND everyone else also defected, try to reset by cooperating
                my_action = 'C'
            else:
                // Otherwise, defect (either I defected and not everyone else did, or I cooperated but others defected)
                my_action = 'D'

    return my_action

```

---

**Reasoning for Robustness and Adaptiveness:**

*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Against "Always Defect":** If opponents always defect, ARC will learn this after round 1 and will also defect from round 2 onwards, minimizing losses and performing as well as possible against consistent defectors.
    *   **Against "Tit-for-Tat" (and similar strategies):** ARC is more forgiving than strict Tit-for-Tat. If a single player defects, ARC punishes, but it doesn't *continue* to punish if the group collectively punishes back (i.e., if everyone defects, ARC will then try to cooperate). This is more robust to occasional mistakes or temporary defections by a minority.
    *   **Against "Grudger" (and unforgiving strategies):** ARC can recover from defections more easily. If a breakdown occurs and everyone defects, ARC attempts to re-establish cooperation, something a strict Grudger might not do.
    *   **Against Randomness:** While not directly programmed to handle random actions, the group-level checking mechanism means that a single random defection will trigger a defection round, but subsequent rounds can recover if the overall group returns to cooperation.

*   **Adaptiveness:**
    *   **Learning Group Behavior:** The strategy adapts by observing the *entire group's* behavior. If the group consistently cooperates, ARC continues to cooperate. If the group falters, ARC responds with a period of defection.
    *   **Path to Recovery:** The specific rule for re-engaging after universal defection is a key adaptive feature. It allows the group to find its way back to cooperation even after a complete breakdown, which is vital for maximizing long-term payoffs in repeated games.
    *   **No Predetermined Patterns:** The strategy doesn't rely on any assumed cooperation schedules or pre-programmed cycles, making it adaptable to any opponent's strategy.

In essence, ARC is a generous but firm strategy. It starts cooperatively, rewards full group cooperation, punishes deviations, and attempts to mend breaches. Its strength lies in its ability to incentivize sustained collective action by making defection costly for the group while providing a clear path for recovery.

description_COOPERATIVE_2 = '''
Here's a design for a cooperative strategy in the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness, as requested.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by initially reciprocating cooperation, but also includes mechanisms to punish defection and eventually forgive past transgressions to reintegrate into cooperative play.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to signal a willingness to participate in the public good.
2.  **Reciprocity:** Reward cooperation from others by continuing to cooperate.
3.  **Punishment:** Deter defection by withholding cooperation when others defect.
4.  **Forgiveness/Reintegration:** Allow for a return to cooperation after a period of punishment, recognizing that defection might have been a strategic response or an initial mistake.
5.  **Parameter Awareness:** While the strategy doesn't explicitly *calculate* based on `k` and `n` in every decision, it implicitly understands that cooperation is beneficial when `k/n > 0.5` (i.e., `k > n/2`). Given `1 < k < n`, this condition is *always* met, meaning that if everyone cooperates, the total payoff from cooperation is `k`, and the cost of contributing is `1`. The benefit of cooperation for the group is `k`, and the cost is `n`. The net benefit for the group is `k-n`. However, the payoff function shows that the private benefit of defecting when others cooperate is `1` (keeping endowment) while the cost of cooperating when others defect is `0` (contributing to a project with no contributors). The crucial aspect for cooperation is that the *average* payoff for cooperation when *everyone* cooperates is higher (`2`) than when *everyone* defects (`1`). The strategy leans into this inherent incentive for collective benefit.

### Strategy Components and Decision Rules:

The strategy will maintain a "cooperation deficit" counter for each player, representing how many times that player has defected against our strategy's expectation of cooperation.

**1. Initial Cooperation:**

*   **Round 1:** Always play **C**. This is the initial overture to cooperation.

**2. Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**

*   **Decision Rule for Player i:**
    *   If player `i` played **C** in the previous round (`t-1`):
        *   If player `i`'s "cooperation deficit" for player `i` is 0, play **C**.
        *   If player `i`'s "cooperation deficit" for player `i` is greater than 0, play **C**. (This is the forgiveness mechanism).
    *   If player `i` played **D** in the previous round (`t-1`):
        *   If player `i`'s "cooperation deficit" for player `i` is 0, play **D** and increment player `i`'s "cooperation deficit" by 1.
        *   If player `i`'s "cooperation deficit" for player `i` is greater than 0, play **D** and increment player `i`'s "cooperation deficit" by 1.

*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
    *   If player `i` has played **C** in the previous round (`t-1`), their "cooperation deficit" is reset to 0. This is the "forgiveness" part. Even if they defected many times before, a single act of cooperation brings them back to a state where we are willing to cooperate with them again, provided they continue to cooperate.

**3. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   In the last round, the incentive to cooperate for future rounds disappears. Given the payoff structure, playing **D** is always a dominant strategy in the *last round* of a finite repeated game, regardless of history. Therefore, in round `r`, the strategy will always play **D**. This is a critical adjustment to maximize payoff in the final interaction.

**4. Cooperation Mindset Alignment:**

*   The strategy is fundamentally cooperative by starting with **C** and only defecting in response to others' defections. It doesn't initiate defection.
*   The forgiveness mechanism ensures that a player isn't permanently excluded from cooperation after a single lapse, promoting a more resilient cooperative environment.
*   The punishment phase is short and directly proportional to the observed defection.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
// Strategy: Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness

// Initialize state for each player (i from 1 to n)
// cooperation_deficit[i]: Tracks how many times player i has defected against our expectation.
// Initialize all cooperation_deficit values to 0.

function decide_action(player_id, current_round, history):
  // history is a list of past rounds, where each round is a list of actions taken by all players.
  // history[t] = [action_player_1_at_t, action_player_2_at_t, ..., action_player_n_at_t]

  if current_round == r: // Last round
    return "D" // Always defect in the last round

  if current_round == 1:
    return "C" // Always cooperate in the first round

  // Get the action of player_id in the previous round
  player_previous_action = history[current_round - 1][player_id - 1] // Adjust for 0-based indexing if needed

  if player_previous_action == "C":
    // Player i cooperated. Reset their deficit (forgiveness).
    cooperation_deficit[player_id] = 0
    return "C"
  else: // player_previous_action == "D"
    // Player i defected.
    if cooperation_deficit[player_id] == 0:
      // First defection or we've already forgiven and they are defecting again.
      cooperation_deficit[player_id] = 1
      return "D"
    else:
      // They defected before and are still defecting. Continue to punish.
      cooperation_deficit[player_id] = cooperation_deficit[player_id] + 1
      return "D"

// Note: This pseudocode assumes a mechanism to track 'cooperation_deficit' for each *other* player
// that this strategy is interacting with. If this is an N-player game and we need to track
// individual players' histories to adjust our strategy towards *them*, then 'cooperation_deficit'
// would be a data structure (e.g., a dictionary or array) indexed by player ID.
// For simplicity in explanation, let's assume we are Player 1 and we are deciding our action
// based on what Player 2, Player 3, ... Player N did in the previous round.
// The 'player_id' parameter here would represent the *opponent's* ID whose action we are evaluating.

// If the strategy needs to maintain its own state *across* all players, it would look more like this:
// state: {
//   "cooperation_deficits": { player_1_id: 0, player_2_id: 0, ... },
//   "last_opponent_actions": { player_1_id: "C", player_2_id: "C", ... } // To store the action of each opponent from last round
// }

// Revised Pseudocode for N-Player Context (Strategy decides its own action):

// Initialize state for the strategy
// This state is global to the strategy, not tied to a specific player i.
strategy_state = {
  "cooperation_deficits": {}, // Dictionary: {opponent_player_id: count}
  "rounds_played": 0
}

function decide_my_action(my_player_id, all_players_actions_history):
  // all_players_actions_history is a list of lists.
  // Example: [[C, C, D], [C, D, D], ...] where inner list is actions at a round.

  current_round = len(all_players_actions_history) + 1 // Rounds are 1-indexed

  if current_round == r:
    return "D" // Always defect in the last round

  if current_round == 1:
    // Initialize deficits for all opponents
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
      if i != my_player_id:
        strategy_state["cooperation_deficits"][i] = 0
    return "C" // Always cooperate in the first round

  // Get the actions from the previous round
  previous_round_actions = all_players_actions_history[-1] // The last entry in history

  my_decision = "C" // Default to cooperation

  for opponent_id, opponent_action in enumerate(previous_round_actions):
    // Ensure opponent_id is 1-indexed if needed, and we skip our own action.
    actual_opponent_id = opponent_id + 1
    if actual_opponent_id == my_player_id:
      continue

    if opponent_action == "C":
      // Opponent cooperated. Reset their deficit.
      strategy_state["cooperation_deficits"][actual_opponent_id] = 0
    else: // opponent_action == "D"
      // Opponent defected.
      if strategy_state["cooperation_deficits"][actual_opponent_id] == 0:
        // First defection, or we've already forgiven and they're defecting again.
        strategy_state["cooperation_deficits"][actual_opponent_id] = 1
        my_decision = "D" // Decision to defect based on this opponent
      else:
        // They defected before and are still defecting. Continue to punish.
        strategy_state["cooperation_deficits"][actual_opponent_id] = strategy_state["cooperation_deficits"][actual_opponent_id] + 1
        my_decision = "D" // Decision to defect based on this opponent

  // If at least one opponent defected and triggered a defection, we defect.
  // If all opponents cooperated, we stick to the default "C".
  return my_decision

```

### Adaptability and Robustness:

*   **Adaptability:** The strategy adapts its behavior based on the observed actions of other players. If others cooperate, it reciprocates. If they defect, it punishes.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Against All Cooperators:** The strategy will cooperate throughout the game, leading to the highest mutual payoff.
    *   **Against All Defectors:** The strategy will defect from round 2 onwards (after the initial cooperative overture) and will continue to defect as the other players continue to defect. This avoids being exploited.
    *   **Against Mixed Strategies:** The strategy can handle a mix of players. It will punish those who defect and forgive those who return to cooperation.
    *   **Against "Grim Trigger" variants:** While "Grim Trigger" permanently punishes, this strategy offers a path back to cooperation by resetting the deficit upon a single cooperative act. This makes it more forgiving and potentially better at re-establishing cooperation in a group.
    *   **Against "Tit-for-Tat" (in N-player context):** "Tit-for-Tat" is naturally a pairwise strategy. In an N-player game, this strategy generalizes the reciprocity principle by tracking individual player behavior and applying its "punish/forgive" logic to each opponent independently. The "cooperation deficit" acts as a more nuanced punishment mechanism than simple "last-round-defection" tracking of Tit-for-Tat.
    *   **The last round defection:** This is a crucial defensive mechanism against strategies that might exploit a naive cooperator in the final round.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between fostering cooperation and protecting itself from exploitation, making it a strong candidate for a cooperative strategy in the described N-Player Public Goods Game.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_3 = '''
This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while being mindful of the repeated nature of the game and the possibility of future cooperation. It's an adaptive "Grim Trigger" with a "Forgiveness" mechanism.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Grim Trigger with Forgiveness"

**Core Principle:** The fundamental goal is to achieve the highest possible payoff, which in this game is achieved through sustained mutual cooperation. This strategy aims to incentivize and maintain this state.

### 1. Decision Rules

My decision in any given round `t` (where `t > 1`) depends on the history of the game up to round `t-1`.

*   **If all players (including myself) cooperated in the previous round (round `t-1`):** Cooperate in round `t`.
*   **If at least one player (excluding myself) defected in the previous round (round `t-1`):** Defect in round `t`.
*   **If I defected in the previous round (round `t-1`):** Defect in round `t`.

**Forgiveness Mechanism:** To avoid permanent punishment for a single lapse in cooperation by an opponent, and to allow for potential re-establishment of cooperation, I will introduce a limited forgiveness window.

*   **If all players (including myself) cooperated in round `t-1`:** Cooperate in round `t`.
*   **If at least one player (excluding myself) defected in round `t-1`:**
    *   **If this is the first round where I've observed a defection from *any* opponent since the last period of full cooperation:** Defect in round `t` for a maximum of **one round**. Then, revert to cooperation in round `t+1` *unless* another defection occurs.
    *   **If this is not the first round where I've observed a defection from *any* opponent since the last period of full cooperation (i.e., I am currently in a punishment phase):** Defect in round `t`.

**Key Points of the Forgiveness Mechanism:**

*   **Targeted Punishment:** The punishment is primarily for the *detected* defection.
*   **One-Round Punishment:** The forgiveness allows for a single round of punishment before re-evaluating. This prevents immediate escalation to perpetual defection if a player makes a mistake or tests the waters.
*   **Re-establishment of Trust:** After a single round of defection, the strategy attempts to return to cooperation, giving opponents a chance to reciprocate.
*   **Adaptive to Persistent Defection:** If opponents continue to defect, the strategy will continue to defect.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** In the very first round, there is no history. To establish a cooperative norm and test the waters, I will **Cooperate (C)**. This is the action that maximizes the potential for mutual high payoff.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the last round, the future incentive for cooperation is removed. The dominant strategy for any rational player in the *last* round of a finitely repeated game with no further consequences is to **Defect (D)**. Therefore, in round `r`, I will **Defect (D)**. This is a purely game-theoretic consideration for the final interaction.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is inherently cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating, signaling a desire for mutually beneficial outcomes.
*   **Reward for Cooperation:** It reciprocates cooperation, reinforcing the positive behavior of other players.
*   **Deterrence of Defection:** It punishes defection, making it less attractive for other players to deviate from cooperation.
*   **Forgiveness:** The forgiveness mechanism is crucial. It acknowledges that players might make mistakes or test boundaries, but it doesn't lock them into a perpetual punishment cycle for a single transgression. This allows for the re-establishment of trust and cooperation, which is essential for maximizing total payoffs over the entire game.
*   **Focus on Long-Term Payoff:** By aiming to maintain a state of mutual cooperation, this strategy prioritizes the highest cumulative payoff over the repeated rounds, aligning with a cooperative mindset.

Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Cooperative Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Reciprocity and Forgiveness (TFT-RF)

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by initially cooperating, rewarding cooperation from others, and defecting only when necessary to discourage exploitation. It's an extension of the classic Tit-for-Tat, incorporating elements that make it more robust in an N-player setting.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to signal a willingness to contribute to the public good.
2.  **Reciprocity:** Reward cooperation from others by continuing to cooperate.
3.  **Punishment:** Defect when a certain threshold of "exploitation" (i.e., others defecting while you cooperate) is met, to discourage future exploitation.
4.  **Forgiveness:** After a period of punishment (everyone defecting), return to cooperation to give the group another chance to stabilize.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` depends on the history of play, specifically on the behavior of other players in the previous round `t-1`.

*   **Initial Round (t=1): Cooperate (C)**
    *   The strategy begins by assuming the best and signaling a willingness to cooperate.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Calculate the "Cooperation Ratio" from the previous round (t-1):**
        *   Let `N_C(t-1)` be the number of players who played Cooperate in round `t-1`.
        *   Let `N_D(t-1)` be the number of players who played Defect in round `t-1`.
        *   `CooperationRatio(t-1) = N_C(t-1) / n`

    *   **Decision Logic:**

        1.  **High Cooperation Environment:** If `CooperationRatio(t-1)` is above a certain threshold `T_coop` (e.g., `T_coop = 0.7` or `0.8`), then **Cooperate (C)**. This indicates a generally cooperative environment, and we want to reinforce it.
        2.  **Punishment Phase Detection:** If `CooperationRatio(t-1)` is below a certain threshold `T_punish` (e.g., `T_punish = 0.2` or `0.3`), and if this has been the case for a consecutive number of rounds (let's say `P_rounds`, e.g., 3 rounds), then we are in a sustained punishment phase. In this case, **Defect (D)**. This aims to signal that continued defection by the group is not sustainable.
        3.  **Forgiveness Trigger:** If we were in a punishment phase (Defecting due to point 2) and in round `t-1`, the `CooperationRatio(t-1)` has now risen above `T_punish`, it's time to **Cooperate (C)** again. This allows the group to potentially re-establish cooperation.
        4.  **Reciprocal Defection:** If `CooperationRatio(t-1)` is below `T_coop` but above `T_punish`, or if we are not in a punishment phase (point 2), and there was at least one player who defected in round `t-1` while I cooperated, *and* the overall cooperation ratio is not high enough to warrant guaranteed cooperation (point 1), then **Defect (D)**. This is a Tit-for-Tat element: punishing immediate exploitation.
        5.  **Default to Cooperation:** If none of the above conditions for defection are met, **Cooperate (C)**. This is the default to encourage cooperation when not explicitly being exploited or in a full-blown punishment scenario.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always Cooperate. This is the initial signal.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the standard N-player public goods game with no future, defection is often the dominant strategy. However, since this is a *cooperative strategy* designed for a tournament, and we cannot assume the nature of other strategies, the strategy will follow its established rules even in the last round. This means if cooperation has been sustained, it will cooperate; if there's been exploitation, it might defect. The inherent "cooperative spirit" is maintained.
*   **Sustained Low Cooperation:** The `P_rounds` parameter is crucial here. If the group consistently defects, this strategy will eventually enter a sustained punishment phase. After a certain number of rounds of sustained punishment (e.g., `P_rounds`), if the cooperation ratio doesn't improve, the strategy might even "give up" and continue defecting (though our design aims for forgiveness). The forgiveness trigger (point 3) is key to preventing perpetual defection cycles.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Initial Goodwill:** Starts with cooperation, believing in the possibility of mutual benefit.
*   **Reward Cooperation:** Directly reciprocates cooperative actions from the group.
*   **Punish Exploitation:** Defection is not malicious but a response to being exploited, aimed at correcting behavior rather than outright revenge. The punishment is temporary and conditional.
*   **Forgive and Re-establish:** The ability to forgive and return to cooperation after a period of defection is critical. It offers the group a chance to reset and build trust again, demonstrating a commitment to a cooperative outcome if achievable.

        // Check if *I* was specifically exploited (played C while someone else played D)
        // This condition is implicitly met if num_defectors > 0 and I played C
        // and the overall cooperation isn't high enough to ignore.

```

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Adaptive:** It adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of other players in the previous round.
*   **Robust:**
    *   It can recover from periods of defection through its forgiveness mechanism.
    *   It's not easily exploited by purely selfish players in the long run due to the reciprocal defection.
    *   It encourages cooperation by starting with it and rewarding it.
    *   The thresholds (`T_coop`, `T_punish`, `P_rounds`) can be tuned to adapt to different game dynamics. For example, a smaller `P_rounds` makes it quicker to forgive, while a larger one makes it more persistent in punishing.

This strategy aims to create a stable and cooperative outcome in the repeated game by balancing the desire for collective gain with the need to protect oneself from exploitation.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_5 = '''
This is a fascinating strategic challenge! The N-Player Public Goods Game, especially in its repeated form with the given parameters, presents a classic dilemma between individual rationality (defecting) and collective well-being (cooperating).

Here's a cooperative strategy designed to be adaptive and robust, focusing on fostering cooperation while protecting against exploitation:

## Cooperative Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Conditional Cooperation and Punishment

This strategy is inspired by the success of Tit-for-Tat in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, but adapted for the public goods setting. It aims to be forgiving, retaliatory when necessary, and to leverage the repeated nature of the game to build a cooperative norm.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Start Cooperatively:** Initiate cooperation to signal a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial behavior.
2.  **Reciprocate:** Mirror the opponent's previous action to encourage sustained cooperation.
3.  **Punish Defection:** Temporarily defect to deter future exploitation.
4.  **Forgive Cooperators:** Revert to cooperation once the exploitation stops.
5.  **Conditional Cooperation based on Group Performance:** Adjust cooperation based on the overall level of cooperation observed in the group. This is crucial because individual actions are heavily influenced by what others do.

### 1. Decision Rules:

Our strategy operates in each round `t` from 1 to `r`.

**At the start of round `t`:**

*   **If `t = 1` (First Round):**
    *   **Play C (Cooperate).**
    *   *Rationale:* To initiate cooperation and signal good intentions.

*   **If `t > 1` (Subsequent Rounds):**
    *   Let `N_C(t-1)` be the number of players who cooperated in round `t-1`.
    *   Let `A_i(t-1)` be the action of player `i` in round `t-1`.

    *   **Calculate Group Cooperation Threshold:**
        *   Define a `cooperation_threshold`. This threshold represents the minimum proportion of cooperators we expect to see in a round for us to maintain our cooperative stance. A good starting point for this threshold could be related to the `k/n` parameter. Since `k < n`, the marginal return of contributing is less than 1, meaning if less than `n/k` people cooperate, defecting is individually rational. Let's set:
            `cooperation_threshold = max(0.5, k/n + epsilon)`  where `epsilon` is a small positive value (e.g., 0.05) to slightly favor cooperation. This ensures we only cooperate if there's a reasonable level of cooperation from the group.

    *   **Determine Our Action:**
        *   **If `N_C(t-1) / n >= cooperation_threshold`:** This means the group demonstrated a sufficient level of cooperation in the previous round.
            *   **Check for exploitation of *us*:** If `A_i(t-1)` was `D` (we defected) in the previous round *and* `N_C(t-1) < n` (not everyone cooperated), it suggests we might have been exploited if we had cooperated. In this specific case, we will *defect* in the current round to signal displeasure and potentially retaliate.
            *   **Otherwise (no direct exploitation or everyone cooperated):** **Play C (Cooperate).**
            *   *Rationale:* If the group is generally cooperative and we weren't directly exploited (or if everyone cooperated), we continue to cooperate.

        *   **If `N_C(t-1) / n < cooperation_threshold`:** This means the group's cooperation level dropped below our expected threshold in the previous round.
            *   **If `A_i(t-1)` was `C` (we cooperated) in the previous round:**
                *   **Play D (Defect).** This is our "punishment" phase. We defect to signal that this level of group cooperation is unacceptable.
                *   *Rationale:* We've been carrying the burden of cooperation, and the group isn't reciprocating. We need to send a signal.
            *   **If `A_i(t-1)` was `D` (we defected) in the previous round:**
                *   **Play D (Defect).**
                *   *Rationale:* The group's cooperation is still low, and we are currently in a retaliatory or defensive stance. We maintain defection.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always cooperate. This is the most important signal of good faith.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the last round, there's no future to incentivize cooperation. Rational players would defect.
    *   **If `t = r`:** **Always play D (Defect).**
    *   *Rationale:* There's no benefit to cooperating in the final round, as there's no future payoff to gain from earned trust. This is a concession to the logic of finite repeated games where the last round is effectively a one-shot game.
*   **Initial History:** Since there's no history before round 1, the strategy is defined to start with cooperation.
*   **No Communication:** The strategy relies solely on observed actions, not on any form of communication.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The core of this strategy is its *tendency* to cooperate.

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** We start with cooperation and continue to cooperate as long as the group exhibits a reasonable level of cooperation.
*   **Forgiveness:** The strategy will revert to cooperation if the group's behavior improves and the `cooperation_threshold` is met again. The punishment phase is temporary.
*   **Focus on Group Outcome:** The `cooperation_threshold` explicitly links our decision to the overall success of the group. We want to encourage a higher level of group contribution.

### Pseudocode:

```
strategy_name = "TitForTatConditionalCooperationPunishment"

function decide_action(player_id, round_number, history, game_parameters):
    n = game_parameters['n']
    k = game_parameters['k']
    r = game_parameters['r']

    # Edge Case: Last Round
    if round_number == r:
        return 'D'

    # First Round
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Subsequent Rounds
    previous_round_actions = history[round_number - 1]['actions'] # List of actions from previous round
    my_previous_action = previous_round_actions[player_id]

    num_cooperators_prev_round = sum(1 for action in previous_round_actions if action == 'C')
    group_cooperation_rate_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round / n

    # Define Cooperation Threshold (slightly adaptive)
    # Ensure it's at least 0.5 to avoid cooperating in heavily defecting groups unless k/n is very low
    cooperation_threshold = max(0.5, k / n + 0.05) # Small epsilon for favoring cooperation

    if group_cooperation_rate_prev_round >= cooperation_threshold:
        # Group was cooperative enough in the last round
        if my_previous_action == 'D' and num_cooperators_prev_round < n:
            # I defected last round AND not everyone else did (potential exploitation signal)
            return 'D' # Punish/Retaliate
        else:
            return 'C' # Continue cooperating
    else:
        # Group cooperation rate was too low
        if my_previous_action == 'C':
            return 'D' # Punish by defecting
        else: # my_previous_action == 'D'
            return 'D' # Continue defecting in punishment/low cooperation phase

```

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Robustness to Opponents:**
    *   **Against Cooperators:** This strategy will foster cooperation by always starting with `C` and reciprocating `C`.
    *   **Against Defectors (Always-D):** We will eventually detect the low `group_cooperation_rate_prev_round` and switch to `D`. In the last round, we will definitely defect.
    *   **Against Triggers (e.g., Grim Trigger):** If an opponent defects once, our strategy will punish (defect for a round or two) but will forgive and return to cooperation if they also return to cooperation. Grim Trigger would never forgive.
    *   **Against Exploitative Strategies (e.g., strategies that try to sucker others):** The `cooperation_threshold` and the check for `my_previous_action == 'D' and num_cooperators_prev_round < n` provide a degree of protection. If we were to defect and the group still cooperated at a low rate, it implies our defection wasn't "punished" effectively by others, and we'd continue defecting. If we cooperated and the group defected heavily, we'd switch to defect.

*   **Adaptability:**
    *   The `cooperation_threshold` helps adapt to different `k/n` ratios. A higher `k/n` implies that cooperation is more beneficial for the group, so we might have a slightly higher `cooperation_threshold`.
    *   The strategy dynamically shifts between cooperation and defection based on observed group behavior, making it adaptable to changing opponent dynamics within the tournament.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between encouraging the public good and protecting oneself from exploitation in a repeated interaction without any pre-arranged coordination.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_6 = '''
This cooperative strategy is designed to encourage sustained cooperation in the repeated Public Goods Game by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection, while also acknowledging the strategic considerations of a repeated game.

## Cooperative Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with a Cooperative Bias and Forgiveness

This strategy blends the effectiveness of Tit-for-Tat with a leaning towards cooperation and a mechanism for re-establishing cooperation after defection.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of the strategy is to mirror the opponent's behavior, but with a preference for cooperation.

*   **If the average behavior of all other players in the previous round was cooperative (more cooperators than defectors), I will cooperate (play C) in the current round.**
*   **If the average behavior of all other players in the previous round was to defect (more defectors than cooperators), I will defect (play D) in the current round.**
*   **If the number of cooperators and defectors was exactly equal in the previous round, I will default to cooperating (play C) in the current round.**

**Pseudocode Representation of Decision Rule (for round t > 1):**

```
function decide_action(history, parameters):
  n = parameters.n
  r = parameters.r
  current_round = history.get_current_round()

  if current_round == 1:
    return "C"  # Cooperate in the first round (see edge cases)

  # Calculate the number of cooperators in the previous round (t-1)
  num_cooperators_prev_round = count_cooperators_in_round(history, current_round - 1)
  num_defectors_prev_round = n - num_cooperators_prev_round

  # Decision based on average behavior of others in the previous round
  if num_cooperators_prev_round > num_defectors_prev_round:
    return "C"  # Cooperate if others were more cooperative
  elif num_defectors_prev_round > num_cooperators_prev_round:
    return "D"  # Defect if others were more defective
  else:
    return "C"  # Default to cooperate if balanced
```

**Explanation of Rationale:**

*   **Cooperative Bias:** By defaulting to cooperation when the previous round was balanced or leaning cooperative, we actively push the system towards cooperation. This is crucial in a public goods game where a critical mass of cooperation is needed for mutual benefit.
*   **Tit-for-Tat Principle:** The strategy punishes defection by defecting in the next round if the majority of others defected. This retaliatory mechanism deters outright exploitation.
*   **Adaptive:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective actions of the other players in the previous round. It doesn't rely on fixed assumptions about opponent behavior.
*   **Robust:** It can handle a variety of opponent strategies. Against purely cooperative opponents, it will remain cooperative. Against purely exploitative opponents, it will defect after the first round. Against mixed strategies, it aims to adapt to the prevailing trend.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** Always cooperate (play C).
    *   **Rationale:** This is the initial phase of the repeated game. By starting with cooperation, we signal a desire for mutual benefit and attempt to establish a cooperative norm from the outset. This is a crucial move to try and "kickstart" cooperation.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** Always defect (play D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The standard game-theoretic analysis of finite repeated games suggests that the only rational strategy is to defect in the last round (and by backward induction, all previous rounds). To maximize my own payoff in this final round, I will defect. This is a purely instrumental decision based on the game's structure.

**Pseudocode for Last Round:**

```
function decide_action(history, parameters):
  n = parameters.n
  r = parameters.r
  current_round = history.get_current_round()

  if current_round == r:
    return "D" # Defect in the last round
  # ... (rest of the logic for t <= r-1)
```

### 3. Being Cooperative

The "cooperative mindset" is embedded in the strategy in several ways:

*   **Initiation:** The strategy begins by attempting to cooperate, demonstrating a willingness to invest in the collective good.
*   **Default to Cooperation:** In situations of ambiguity (equal numbers of cooperators and defectors), the strategy chooses cooperation. This signifies a preference for building positive outcomes.
*   **Punishment as a Tool for Cooperation:** The defection in response to widespread defection is not purely punitive but serves as a signal and deterrent aimed at guiding the group back towards a more mutually beneficial cooperative state. It's a "tough love" approach designed to protect the cooperative endeavor.
*   **Adaptive but Trusting:** While it responds to defection, it doesn't hold grudges indefinitely. If the collective behavior shifts back towards cooperation, this strategy will re-engage in cooperation. It's a strategy that seeks to *re-establish* cooperation rather than permanently punish.

**Key Principles Embodied:**

*   **Reciprocity:** "I'll do what you did."
*   **Forgiveness (Implicit):** If the group reverts to cooperation, I will too.
*   **Fairness:** Responding to overall trends rather than individual actions (though individual actions are aggregated to determine the trend).
*   **Proactive for Cooperation:** Taking the initiative to cooperate in the first round.

This strategy aims to create a self-reinforcing cycle of cooperation by rewarding it and discouraging widespread defection, all while being grounded in the rational considerations of a repeated game.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_7 = '''
This N-Player Public Goods Game, despite its simultaneous-move nature in each round, becomes a richer strategic environment due to repeated interaction and perfect information. The core challenge is to incentivize cooperation when individual defection is tempting, especially given the payoff structure where defecting when others cooperate yields the highest individual gain.

Here's a cooperative strategy designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Forgiving Reciprocity with Threshold"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a degree of forgiveness to avoid being exploited by a single defection. It adapts based on the overall cooperation level observed in the game.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of the strategy is to mirror the behavior of the *average* player in the previous round, with a bias towards cooperation if the overall cooperation level is sufficiently high.

*   **If the proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round was above a certain threshold:** Play **C** (Cooperate).
*   **If the proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round was below or equal to the threshold:** Play **D** (Defect).

**The Threshold:** The threshold is crucial for adaptation and robustness. It should be set at a level that represents a "stable" or "beneficial" level of cooperation for the group. A good starting point for this threshold is derived from the game parameters, specifically when cooperation starts to become collectively beneficial.

Let $P_C$ be the proportion of cooperators in a round.
The average payoff for a cooperator is $0 + (k/n) \times P_C \times n = k \times P_C$.
The average payoff for a defector is $1 + (k/n) \times P_C \times n = 1 + k \times P_C$.

For cooperation to be collectively beneficial (i.e., for all players to be better off if everyone cooperates than if everyone defects), the payoff from universal cooperation must be greater than the payoff from universal defection.
Payoff from all C: $n \times (0 + (k/n) \times n) = nk$.
Payoff from all D: $n \times (1 + (k/n) \times 0) = n$.
So, $nk > n$, which simplifies to $k > 1$. This condition is already given in the game parameters.

However, we are interested in the point where cooperation starts to yield a higher *average* payoff than defection, for the *average* player. This occurs when:
Average payoff of a cooperator > Average payoff of a defector
$k \times P_C > 1 + k \times P_C$
This inequality $0 > 1$ is never true, which highlights the temptation to defect.

Instead, let's consider the point where the average payoff *per player* when a certain proportion $P_C$ cooperate is higher than the average payoff when $P_D = 1-P_C$ cooperate. This is not as direct.

A more practical approach to setting the threshold is to consider when *individual* cooperation begins to offer a reasonable return, even considering the possibility of defection. When is the payoff for cooperating at least as good as defecting, *given a certain level of cooperation from others*?

Let $P_C$ be the proportion of cooperators.
If player $i$ cooperates: $\pi_i = (k/n) \times n \times P_C = k \times P_C$.
If player $i$ defects: $\pi_i = 1 + (k/n) \times n \times P_C = 1 + k \times P_C$.

For cooperation to be the rational choice *for an individual* in a single round, assuming all others cooperate ($P_C = 1$):
$k \times 1 > 1 + k \times 1$ which is $k > 1+k$, or $0 > 1$, never true.

The condition $1 < k < n$ implies that the total contribution is always less than the sum of individual endowments if everyone contributes. The $(k/n)$ factor amplifies the collective benefit.

Let's re-evaluate the threshold. We want to promote cooperation when it's "almost" beneficial for everyone. Consider the point where the *gain* from collective cooperation is substantial enough.

If $P_C$ players cooperate:
*   A cooperator gets: $(k/n) \times n \times P_C = k \times P_C$
*   A defector gets: $1 + (k/n) \times n \times P_C = 1 + k \times P_C$

For cooperation to be sustained, the payoff from cooperating should be at least *close* to the payoff from defecting. The difference is 1.

A robust threshold for cooperation should reflect a level where the collective benefit $(k \times P_C)$ is sufficiently large. A good threshold might be one that ensures the *average* payoff across all players, if everyone were to cooperate at that level, is substantially higher than the payoff from universal defection.

Let's define the threshold based on the idea that cooperation should be encouraged when the average payoff *received by all players combined* from that level of cooperation is significantly greater than the payoff they would get from everyone defecting.
Total payoff if $P_C$ cooperate = $P_C \times (k \times P_C) + (1-P_C) \times (1 + k \times P_C)$
Total payoff if 0 cooperate = $n \times 1 = n$.

We want to cooperate when the expected payoff for the group is significantly better.
Consider the point where the *share* from cooperation starts to outweigh the private endowment advantage of defection.
If the proportion of cooperators is $P_C$, a defector gets 1 unit more than a cooperator.
We want to cooperate if $k \times P_C$ is large enough to compensate for this difference for at least some players, or if the overall benefit is high.

A pragmatic threshold: **Cooperate if the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was greater than $(n-k)/n$.**
Why $(n-k)/n$?
If the proportion of cooperators is $P_C = (n-k)/n$:
*   Payoff for cooperator: $k \times P_C = k \times (n-k)/n = (nk - k^2)/n = k - k^2/n$.
*   Payoff for defector: $1 + k \times P_C = 1 + (nk - k^2)/n = 1 + k - k^2/n$.

This threshold is chosen because it represents a point where the collective gain from cooperation ($k \times P_C$) is significant relative to the temptation to defect (which is always 1 unit more for a defector). As $k$ approaches $n$, the threshold approaches 0 (meaning we need very little cooperation to trigger further cooperation). As $k$ approaches 1, the threshold approaches $(n-1)/n$ (meaning we need almost everyone to cooperate for us to cooperate). This is a sensible trade-off.

*   **Decision Rule Refined:**
    *   Let $P_{C, t-1}$ be the proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$.
    *   Calculate the threshold $T = (n-k)/n$.
    *   **If $P_{C, t-1} > T$, play C.**
    *   **If $P_{C, t-1} \le T$, play D.**

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   There is no previous round history. To initiate cooperation and signal the intention to build a cooperative norm, the strategy should start by cooperating.
    *   **Decision:** Play **C** in Round 1.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   In the last round, there is no future to incentivize. The dominant strategy in a single-shot game is to defect. This strategy, aiming to be robust, recognizes this.
    *   **Decision:** Play **D** in Round $r$.

*   **After a defection:**
    *   The strategy will naturally adapt through the decision rule. If a defection causes $P_{C, t-1}$ to drop below the threshold $T$, the strategy will switch to defecting in the current round.
    *   **Forgiveness:** The strategy is "forgiving" in the sense that a single defection doesn't trigger permanent defection. It waits to see if cooperation rebounds. If the group collectively returns to a cooperative state (i.e., $P_{C, t-1}$ goes above $T$), the strategy will revert to cooperating.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Intent:** The strategy's primary intent is to achieve the highest possible cumulative payoff for all players by fostering a cooperative equilibrium. It believes that long-term gains from sustained cooperation outweigh short-term gains from opportunistic defection.
*   **Initialization:** Starting with cooperation in Round 1 is a clear signal of this cooperative intent.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The adaptive threshold allows the strategy to be sensitive to the group's behavior. It's not rigidly cooperative; it cooperates when the group's actions suggest that cooperation is being reciprocated or is emerging.
*   **Punishment:** While cooperative, the strategy isn't naive. It punishes deviations from cooperative norms by defecting, but this punishment is temporary and conditional on the group's overall behavior. This "tit-for-tat" like element, but applied to the group's aggregate behavior, is key to its robustness.

    previous_cooperators = count_cooperators_current_round // This will be used as 'previous_cooperators' in the next call to decide_action
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Logic:**

*   The `previous_cooperators` variable is crucial. It stores the *count* of cooperators from the immediately preceding round.
*   In `decide_action`, we first handle the absolute first and last rounds.
*   For intermediate rounds, we calculate the `proportion_cooperators_previous`. This uses the `previous_cooperators` count.
*   The `threshold` is calculated using the game parameters.
*   The decision is made by comparing the `proportion_cooperators_previous` to the `threshold`.
*   The `update_state` function is called *after* the current round's actions are known. It recalculates the `previous_cooperators` count, which will then be used in the *next* round's `decide_action` call. This ensures the strategy always looks back one full round.

This strategy is cooperative in its intent, adaptive to group behavior, and robust by punishing defection while retaining the possibility of returning to cooperation. It aims to find a sustainable cooperative equilibrium that benefits all players in the long run.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_8 = '''
This strategy aims to foster cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection, adapting to the unfolding history of the game. It's designed to be generally cooperative while remaining resilient to exploitation.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Reciprocal Conditional Cooperation"

This strategy is a form of **Tit-for-Tat**, adapted for an N-player environment. The core idea is to start cooperatively and then mirror the behavior of the majority of other players. This provides a strong incentive for others to cooperate, as collective defection leads to lower individual payoffs for everyone.

### 1. Decision Rules

**My Decision Rule (Player i):**

In any given round `t` (where `t` > 1):

*   **If the majority of players cooperated in the previous round (t-1):** I will cooperate (play C).
*   **If the majority of players defected in the previous round (t-1):** I will defect (play D).

**What constitutes "majority"?** A simple majority is defined as strictly more than `n/2` players.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** I will always cooperate (play C).
    *   **Rationale:** This is the foundation of the cooperative mindset. By initiating cooperation, we create the opportunity for mutual gain. In the absence of any history, a cooperative start is the most aligned with the goal of maximizing collective payoffs.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** I will always defect (play D).
    *   **Rationale:** This is a crucial element for robustness. In a finitely repeated game, the last round is a one-shot game. In a one-shot public goods game where 1 < k < n, defecting is the dominant strategy (as the individual payoff of defecting is always higher regardless of others' actions). Therefore, to avoid being exploited in the final round, defecting is the rational choice. This also prevents "retaliation" from other players who might also defect in the last round.

### 3. Be Cooperative

This strategy is cooperative in the following ways:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** It always starts by cooperating, signaling a willingness to contribute to the public good.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as a majority of other players are also cooperating. This reinforces positive behavior and leads to higher payoffs for everyone involved when cooperation is sustained.
*   **Reciprocal Behavior:** It directly responds to the collective actions of others, encouraging a cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Adaptive:** It learns from the history of the game and adjusts its behavior accordingly, making it robust to varying opponent strategies.

### Strategy Robustness and Adaptability

This "Reciprocal Conditional Cooperation" strategy is designed to be robust because:

*   **Resilient to initial defectors:** If some players defect in the first round, the strategy still cooperates. This gives the system a chance to recover and move towards cooperation if the majority eventually shifts.
*   **Punishes defection:** By defecting when the majority defects, it ensures that sustained defection by others is met with a retaliatory response, preventing perpetual exploitation.
*   **Exploits no one:** It never initiates a defection to exploit a cooperative player. Its defections are always in response to observed behavior.
*   **Adapts to dynamics:** It continuously monitors the collective behavior and adjusts its own strategy, making it adaptable to various opponent strategies that might emerge in the tournament.
*   **Addresses the end-game problem:** The explicit defection in the last round is a standard solution to the backward induction problem in finitely repeated games, ensuring that the strategy doesn't leave itself vulnerable.

This strategy balances a desire for cooperation with the pragmatic need to protect itself from exploitation, making it a strong contender in a competitive tournament setting.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_9 = '''
This is an interesting challenge! Designing a cooperative strategy in a repeated Public Goods Game without explicit communication or predefined coordination is a classic problem in game theory. The key is to balance the temptation to defect with the desire to sustain cooperation.

Here's a cooperative strategy designed to be adaptive and robust:

**Strategy Name:** **"Generous Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness"**

This strategy is inspired by Tit-for-Tat but with modifications to encourage cooperation and handle situations where defection might be beneficial for the group in the long run.

**Core Philosophy:**

*   **Start Cooperative:** Assume other players want to cooperate and signal this intention.
*   **Reciprocate Actions:** Mirror the behavior of the majority of players in the previous round.
*   **Be Forgiving:** Don't punish sustained defection indefinitely. Allow opportunities for cooperation to resume.
*   **Consider Group Benefit:** While aiming for individual cooperation, recognize that a moderate level of cooperation can be mutually beneficial.

---

**1. Decision Rules:**

My strategy's decision in round *t* will depend on the aggregate behavior of other players in round *t-1*. Specifically, I will track the **proportion of cooperators** in the previous round.

Let $N_C(t-1)$ be the number of players who played C in round $t-1$.
Let $N_D(t-1)$ be the number of players who played D in round $t-1$.
Total players $n = N_C(t-1) + N_D(t-1)$.

*   **If I played C in round *t-1*:**
    *   **High Cooperation:** If $N_C(t-1) \ge \lceil n/2 \rceil$ (i.e., at least half of the players, including myself if I cooperated, were cooperators), then I will play **C** in round *t*. This reinforces successful cooperation.
    *   **Moderate Cooperation:** If $N_C(t-1) < \lceil n/2 \rceil$ but $N_C(t-1) > 0$, I will play **C** in round *t*. I am forgiving and willing to give cooperation another chance, even if it was not fully reciprocated. This also acknowledges that my own defection might have contributed to the drop in cooperation.
    *   **Low or Zero Cooperation:** If $N_C(t-1) = 0$ (meaning everyone else defected, or I was the only one who cooperated and everyone else defected), I will play **D** in round *t*. This is a signal that sustained defection is not acceptable and I will defend my endowment.

*   **If I played D in round *t-1*:**
    *   **Resumption of Cooperation:** If $N_C(t-1) \ge \lceil n/2 \rceil$ (i.e., a majority of players have returned to cooperation), then I will play **C** in round *t*. This is my "forgiveness" mechanism, allowing for reconciliation after a period of defection.
    *   **Continued Defection:** If $N_C(t-1) < \lceil n/2 \rceil$, I will play **D** in round *t*. I will continue to defect until a clear majority of players signal their intent to cooperate.

**In essence:**

*   I start by cooperating.
*   I am more likely to cooperate if others are cooperating.
*   I am forgiving and will try to cooperate again if a significant portion of players are cooperating.
*   I will defect if cooperation collapses significantly, but I am ready to return to cooperation if the group behavior shifts back towards cooperation.

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   As per the core philosophy, the strategy begins by signaling cooperative intent.
    *   **Decision:** **C** (Cooperate).

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   In the final round, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. The dominant strategy for any rational player in a single-round game is to defect. Therefore, to maximize my own payoff in the absence of future consequences, I will defect.
    *   **Decision:** **D** (Defect).

*   **Near the End of the Game (e.g., last few rounds):**
    *   This is a crucial point. The standard game theory prediction is that players will start defecting in anticipation of the end. My strategy needs to account for this.
    *   If the number of remaining rounds is small (e.g., $\le 3$, this threshold can be tuned), I will switch to defecting. This is a pragmatic approach to recognize that sustained cooperation may become irrational as the end approaches.
    *   **Decision:** **D** (Defect) if $t \ge r - \text{small_threshold}$.
    *   *(Note: The exact value of `small_threshold` can be determined through empirical testing. A value of 3-5 rounds might be a good starting point).*

---

**3. Being Cooperative:**

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative because:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It begins with a cooperative move, aiming to establish a positive norm.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperative behavior from others by continuing to cooperate.
*   **Forgiveness:** It does not hold grudges indefinitely. If a group of players starts cooperating again, it is willing to rejoin them.
*   **Threshold-Based Cooperation:** The threshold of $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ is designed to be inclusive. It requires a substantial portion of the group to cooperate, making it a robust indicator of general cooperative intent, rather than a single defector derailing the cooperative norm. This threshold is *always* greater than 1 for $n \ge 2$.

---

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION GetAction(my_history, opponent_histories, round_number, total_rounds, n, k):

    // Handle the last round explicitly
    IF round_number == total_rounds THEN
        RETURN "D" // Defect in the final round

    // Handle early defection for the last few rounds (tune the threshold)
    LET defection_anticipation_threshold = 3
    IF round_number >= total_rounds - defection_anticipation_threshold THEN
        RETURN "D" // Defect to anticipate the end of the game

    // Round 1: Always cooperate to signal intent
    IF round_number == 1 THEN
        RETURN "C"

    // For all other rounds:
    LET last_round_actions = opponent_histories[round_number - 2] // Actions from previous round (index 0 is round 1)
    LET num_cooperators_last_round = 0
    FOR EACH action IN last_round_actions DO
        IF action == "C" THEN
            num_cooperators_last_round = num_cooperators_last_round + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    LET my_last_action = my_history[round_number - 2] // My action in the previous round

    // Decision logic based on the previous round's cooperation level

    IF my_last_action == "C" THEN
        // If I cooperated last round
        IF num_cooperators_last_round >= CEILING(n / 2.0) THEN
            // Majority cooperated, including me (or majority of others)
            RETURN "C"
        ELSE IF num_cooperators_last_round > 0 THEN
            // Some cooperation, but not a majority. Be forgiving.
            RETURN "C"
        ELSE
            // No one cooperated (or only I did). Signal that this is not sustainable.
            RETURN "D"
        END IF
    ELSE // my_last_action == "D"
        // If I defected last round
        IF num_cooperators_last_round >= CEILING(n / 2.0) THEN
            // A majority have returned to cooperation. Forgive and rejoin.
            RETURN "C"
        ELSE
            // Majority still defecting. Continue to defect.
            RETURN "D"
        END IF
    END IF

END FUNCTION
```

**Robustness and Adaptability:**

*   **Adaptive:** The strategy constantly monitors the group's behavior and adjusts its own actions accordingly. It doesn't follow a fixed pattern.
*   **Robust to Opponent Types:**
    *   **Always Cooperators:** The strategy will reciprocate their cooperation and continue to cooperate, leading to high payoffs for everyone.
    *   **Always Defectors:** In the initial rounds, my strategy will cooperate, leading to low payoffs. However, as defection is observed, my strategy will eventually switch to defecting after a few rounds of observing no significant cooperation, thus protecting its own endowment from being exploited.
    *   **Tit-for-Tat players:** My strategy's "generous tit-for-tat" nature will likely lead to mutual cooperation with other cooperative strategies.
    *   **Random players:** The majority rule will tend to average out random behavior over time. If enough players are randomly cooperative, my strategy will likely mirror that.
*   **Handles Free-Riders:** While it initially tries to foster cooperation, it will not be exploited indefinitely. If a significant portion of players consistently defect, my strategy will retaliate by defecting.

This strategy aims to find a balance between promoting cooperation and protecting itself from exploitation, making it well-suited for a diverse tournament environment.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_10 = '''
This is an interesting challenge, as the Public Goods Game (PGG) inherently creates a tension between individual rationality (defecting to maximize personal gain in a single round) and collective benefit (cooperating to maximize total payoff). Given the repeated nature of the game and perfect information, strategies that aim for sustained cooperation while punishing defection are often successful.

Here's a proposed cooperative strategy, designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with a Cooperative Threshold (TT-CT)

This strategy is a direct extension of the well-known "Tit-for-Tat" strategy, adapted for the public goods context. It emphasizes initial cooperation, reciprocates the opponent's last move, but also incorporates a mechanism to punish sustained defection and reward the return to cooperation.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating. This signals a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial cooperation and establishes a baseline.
2.  **Reciprocity:** Mirror the behavior of the *average* player in the previous round. If the average player cooperated, cooperate. If the average player defected, defect. This is a more robust form of reciprocity than just looking at one specific opponent, especially in an N-player game.
3.  **Punishment for Sustained Defection:** If the proportion of cooperators in previous rounds falls below a certain threshold for an extended period, defect to signal dissatisfaction and pressure for a return to cooperation.
4.  **Forgiveness:** After a period of punishment, if the majority of players return to cooperation, be willing to cooperate again.

### 1. Decision Rules:

Let $N_C(t-1)$ be the number of players who cooperated in round $t-1$.
Let $P_C(t-1) = N_C(t-1) / n$ be the proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$.

**Round 1:**
*   **Play C.**

**Round t > 1:**

*   **If $P_C(t-1) \ge \text{Cooperation Threshold} (\theta)$:**
    *   **Play C.**
    *   This means that in the previous round, a sufficient number of players cooperated. We are maintaining the cooperative environment.

*   **Else (if $P_C(t-1) < \theta$):**
    *   **Play D.**
    *   This is a form of punishment. The proportion of cooperators has dropped below our acceptable level. We are signaling that this is not sustainable for us.

**Cooperation Threshold ($\theta$):**
The cooperation threshold is a crucial parameter. It represents the minimum proportion of cooperators we are willing to tolerate to continue cooperating. A good starting point could be slightly above the Nash Equilibrium payoff for a single round defecting. Given that $1 < k < n$, the single-round Nash Equilibrium is for everyone to defect. The payoff for defecting when everyone else defects is 1. The payoff for cooperating when everyone else defects is $(k/n) \times 0 = 0$.

However, in a repeated game, we're aiming for a higher collective payoff. A sensible threshold would be one that ensures the *average* payoff from cooperation is still higher than the payoff from constant defection for the group. Consider the case where $n-1$ players defect and 1 cooperates. The defector gets $1 + (k/n) \times 1$. The cooperator gets $0 + (k/n) \times 1$. If $(k/n) > 1$, then defecting is still better for the individual.

A more pragmatic approach is to set the threshold based on what we *believe* is a healthy level of cooperation. A threshold of **0.5** (more than half the players cooperating) is a strong starting point. If less than half cooperate, it suggests the group is trending towards defection.

**Punishment Duration:**
We need a mechanism to ensure that a temporary dip in cooperation doesn't lead to perpetual punishment. We can introduce a counter for sustained defection.

Let $SustainedDefectionCounter$ be a counter that increments when $P_C(t-1) < \theta$ and resets to 0 when $P_C(t-1) \ge \theta$.

*   **If $P_C(t-1) \ge \theta$:**
    *   **Play C.**
    *   $SustainedDefectionCounter = 0$.

*   **Else (if $P_C(t-1) < \theta$):**
    *   Increment $SustainedDefectionCounter$.
    *   **If $SustainedDefectionCounter < \text{Punishment_Depth}$:**
        *   **Play D.** (Mild punishment: continue defecting to pressure others)
    *   **Else (if $SustainedDefectionCounter \ge \text{Punishment_Depth}$):**
        *   **Play D.** (Severe punishment: we've been in this state for a while, let's maintain our own payoff)

    *   **Crucially, after a period of sustained defection, if the next round's $P_C(t-1)$ *recovers* to $\ge \theta$, we should be willing to forgive.** This is handled by the main rule, where if $P_C(t-1) \ge \theta$, we play C.

**Revised Decision Rules with Punishment Depth:**

*   **Initialize:** $SustainedDefectionCounter = 0$.
*   **Cooperation Threshold ($\theta$):** e.g., 0.5
*   **Punishment Depth:** e.g., 3 rounds (This means we will defect for at least 3 consecutive rounds if the threshold is not met, before potentially reconsidering if the situation *further deteriorates*.)

**Round 1:**
*   **Play C.**

**Round t > 1:**

*   Calculate $P_C(t-1)$ based on observed actions in round $t-1$.
*   **If $P_C(t-1) \ge \theta$:**
    *   **Play C.**
    *   $SustainedDefectionCounter = 0$.
*   **Else (if $P_C(t-1) < \theta$):**
    *   Increment $SustainedDefectionCounter$.
    *   **If $SustainedDefectionCounter < \text{Punishment_Depth}$:**
        *   **Play D.**
    *   **Else (if $SustainedDefectionCounter \ge \text{Punishment_Depth}$):**
        *   **Play D.** (This effectively means we continue to defect as long as the overall cooperation level remains below our threshold, even after the initial "punishment" phase. The key is that if the threshold *is* met again, we switch back to C.)

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (r=1):**
    *   As stated, always **Play C**. This establishes a cooperative intent and a baseline for others to follow.

*   **Last Round (r=r):**
    *   This is the most challenging. In the absence of future interactions, the rational choice for any self-interested player is to defect in the last round, regardless of history. This is because there's no future penalty for defection.
    *   **Strategy:** In the final round (round r), **always Play D**. This is a concession to the game's finite nature. The hope is that by cooperating throughout the preceding $r-1$ rounds, the total payoff accumulated will still be significant, and this last defection might even incentivize a strong cooperative signal in a hypothetical *next* round if the game were to continue. It's a pragmatic choice reflecting the loss of the future incentive.

*   **No Opponent Cooperation at All ( $P_C$ always 0):**
    *   The strategy will quickly default to playing D after the first round and stay there, as the $P_C < \theta$ condition will always be met. This is the expected and rational behavior in such a scenario.

*   **Complete Cooperation ($P_C$ always 1):**
    *   The strategy will always play C, which is the optimal outcome.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** It begins by assuming the best and initiating cooperation, providing an opportunity for mutual gain.
*   **Sustained Cooperation:** It rewards and maintains cooperation as long as a sufficient number of other players participate. The "Cooperation Threshold" ensures that we don't defect prematurely based on minor fluctuations.
*   **Forgiveness:** The strategy's core loop *resets* to cooperation immediately if the overall cooperation level recovers above the threshold. This means it doesn't hold grudges indefinitely and is quick to rejoin a cooperative effort.
*   **Group-Oriented Reciprocity:** By reacting to the *average* player's behavior ($P_C$), it aims to foster a group dynamic that is beneficial for everyone, rather than focusing on individual players' actions. This is more aligned with a "public good" mentality.
*   **Punishment as a Tool, Not an End:** The defection is a signal to *restore* the cooperative state. It's a mechanism to make defection costly for the group, thereby incentivizing a return to the mutually beneficial state. The "Punishment Depth" prevents overly aggressive or prolonged punitive actions.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Parameters
n = number_of_players
r = number_of_rounds
k = multiplication_factor
theta = 0.5 // Cooperation Threshold (e.g., 50%)
Punishment_Depth = 3 // Number of rounds to sustain defection before further consideration

// State Variables
my_last_action = "C" // Initial assumption
sustained_defection_counter = 0
round_num = 1

// Function to make decision for the current round
function decide_action(history):
    // history is a list of lists, where history[t-1] contains actions of all players in round t-1

    if round_num == 1:
        my_action = "C"
    else if round_num == r: // Last round
        my_action = "D"
    else:
        // Calculate proportion of cooperators in the previous round
        num_cooperators_prev_round = 0
        previous_round_actions = history[round_num - 2] // history is 0-indexed, rounds are 1-indexed
        for player_action in previous_round_actions:
            if player_action == "C":
                num_cooperators_prev_round += 1
        
        proportion_cooperators_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round / n

        if proportion_cooperators_prev_round >= theta:
            my_action = "C"
            sustained_defection_counter = 0 // Reset counter on cooperation
        else:
            sustained_defection_counter += 1
            if sustained_defection_counter < Punishment_Depth:
                my_action = "D" // Mild punishment
            else:
                my_action = "D" // Sustained punishment/defection

    round_num += 1
    return my_action

// Initialization outside the function call
// Call decide_action() for each round, passing the history up to the previous round.
```

This strategy aims for a balance. It's not blindly cooperative, but it strongly favors cooperation and has mechanisms to re-establish it if it breaks down. Its adaptive nature comes from reacting to the aggregate behavior of the group, making it robust to various individual player strategies within the tournament.

Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness:

## Cooperative Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but also includes a mechanism to forgive occasional lapses, making it robust against noise or temporary deviations. The core idea is to maintain a "cooperative baseline" and adjust behavior based on observed actions.

**Core Principle:** Start cooperatively, reward cooperation, punish defection, and forgive occasional defections to try and re-establish cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision rule is based on the player's own action in the previous round and the *average* behavior of other players in the previous round. This allows for adaptation to the overall group's tendency towards cooperation.

**For player `i` in round `t > 1`:**

*   **If player `i` cooperated (played C) in round `t-1`:**
    *   **If the average cooperation rate of *other* players in round `t-1` was above a certain threshold (`C_threshold`), then play C in round `t`.**
    *   **Otherwise (average cooperation rate of others was below `C_threshold`), play D in round `t`.**

*   **If player `i` defected (played D) in round `t-1`:**
    *   **If the average cooperation rate of *other* players in round `t-1` was above a certain threshold (`C_threshold`), then play C in round `t`.** (This is the "forgiveness" mechanism – attempting to re-establish cooperation even after defecting).
    *   **Otherwise (average cooperation rate of others was below `C_threshold`), play D in round `t`.**

**Key Parameter: `C_threshold`**

This threshold determines how much cooperation from others is needed to sustain cooperation. A higher `C_threshold` makes the strategy more demanding and less forgiving. A lower `C_threshold` makes it more forgiving but potentially exploitable.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (`t = 1`): Always Cooperate (C).**
    *   The initial round is crucial to set a cooperative tone. There's no history to learn from, so starting with cooperation is the most aligned with the strategy's intent.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`): Always Defect (D).**
    *   This is a standard response in finitely repeated games due to the "end-game" problem. Since there are no future rounds to influence, the incentive is to maximize immediate payoff by defecting. This is a strategic necessity for robustness, even within a cooperative strategy.

*   **Rounds where `n=2`:**
    *   The average cooperation rate of "other" players is simply the action of the single other player. The logic remains the same.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative

*   **Initial Cooperative Stance:** The strategy begins with cooperation, signaling a desire to build a mutually beneficial outcome.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Cooperation is maintained as long as the group exhibits a reasonable level of cooperative behavior. This rewards positive behavior.
*   **Forgiveness:** The strategy attempts to re-establish cooperation even after defecting, provided others are still cooperating. This prevents a spiral of mutual defection from minor deviations and allows for recovery.
*   **Alignment with Group Benefit:** The strategy implicitly favors outcomes where cooperation is prevalent, as this leads to higher total payoffs for the group and thus higher individual payoffs in scenarios where `k/n > 0.5`.

// Global state (maintained across rounds):
// history: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary stores {'player_actions': {player_id: action, ...}} for each round.
// my_last_action: The action player i took in the previous round.

      if action == 'C':
        total_other_cooperators += 1

  average_other_cooperation_rate = 0
  if num_other_players > 0:
    average_other_cooperation_rate = total_other_cooperators / num_other_players

  // Decision Logic
  If my_last_action == 'C':
    // If I cooperated last round
    If average_other_cooperation_rate >= C_threshold:
      my_last_action = 'C'
      Return 'C'
    Else:
      // Others defected more than threshold, punish by defecting
      my_last_action = 'D'
      Return 'D'
  Else (my_last_action == 'D'):
    // If I defected last round
    // Forgiveness: Attempt to cooperate if others are still cooperating reasonably well
    If average_other_cooperation_rate >= C_threshold:
      my_last_action = 'C'
      Return 'C'
    Else:
      // Others also defected, continue defecting
      my_last_action = 'D'
      Return 'D'

// Initialization before the first round:
// my_last_action = 'C' // Or any default, as it's overwritten in round 1
```

**Choosing `C_threshold`:**

The `C_threshold` is a critical parameter. A good starting point might be slightly above the payoff-equalizing point for mutual defection vs. one defector.

*   Payoff for defecting when all others cooperate: `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`
*   Payoff for cooperating when all others cooperate: `0 + (k/n) * n = k`
*   Payoff for defecting when one cooperates: `1 + (k/n) * 1`
*   Payoff for cooperating when one cooperates: `0 + (k/n) * 1`
*   Payoff for mutual defection: `1 + (k/n) * 0 = 1`

If `k/n` is small (e.g., `k=2, n=6`, `k/n = 1/3`), defecting is always better *individually* in a single round if you expect others to cooperate. However, in a repeated game, cooperation can be sustained.

A `C_threshold` around **0.5 to 0.7** would be a reasonable starting point. It requires a majority of other players to cooperate to sustain one's own cooperation, providing some resilience. The exact optimal `C_threshold` could be found through simulation or evolutionary game theory analysis, but for a single robust strategy, this range provides a balance.

This strategy is adaptive because it learns from the group's behavior and robust because it has a forgiveness mechanism to recover from defection and a clear strategy for the endgame.

description_COOPERATIVE_12 = '''
## Cooperative Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game: "Tit-for-Tat with Cooperative Threshold"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while also incorporating a mechanism to overcome the inherent temptation to defect and to adapt to evolving group behavior. It is designed to be robust and to align with a cooperative mindset.

**Core Principle:** Start cooperatively, reciprocate cooperation, and punish defection. However, introduce a "cooperative threshold" to allow for recovery and to signal a willingness to return to cooperation after periods of defection.

---

### 1. Decision Rules:

**Primary Decision Rule (Round t > 1):**

*   **If the average cooperation rate in the previous round (t-1) was at least `cooperative_threshold`:**
    *   **Play C (Cooperate).**
*   **Else (average cooperation rate in the previous round was below `cooperative_threshold`):**
    *   **Play D (Defect).**

**Explanation of `cooperative_threshold`:**

The `cooperative_threshold` is a dynamically calculated value that represents the minimum level of group cooperation we are willing to tolerate to continue cooperating ourselves. It is designed to be adaptive. A good initial value would be the expected payoff of defecting when everyone else cooperates, divided by the payoff of cooperating when everyone else cooperates. However, a simpler, robust approach for this strategy is to define it as a percentage of total players.

Let's set `cooperative_threshold` to **`n / 2` (i.e., more than half the players must cooperate for us to continue cooperating)**. This ensures that we are not overly susceptible to exploitation by a small number of defectors.

**Rationale:**

*   **Reciprocity:** If others cooperate, we cooperate. This rewards cooperative behavior and encourages its continuation.
*   **Punishment:** If others defect, we defect. This punishes defection and deters free-riding.
*   **Threshold:** The `cooperative_threshold` prevents a single round of defection from collapsing cooperation indefinitely. It gives the group a chance to "reset" and return to cooperation if a sufficient number of players demonstrate a commitment to it.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Play C (Cooperate).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative starting point is to initiate cooperation. This signals our intention to be cooperative and provides an opportunity for others to reciprocate. This is the foundational step for our strategy.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Play D (Defect).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The incentive to defect and maximize individual immediate gain becomes dominant. This is a standard rational response in the final round of a repeated game, as the "shadow of the future" disappears. While this is a departure from pure cooperation, it's a pragmatic adjustment to ensure we don't leave easy gains on the table in the very last instance.

*   **Game with `k <= n/2` (less than or equal to half the players are cooperators):**
    *   **Always play D (Defect).**
    *   **Rationale:** If the multiplication factor `k` is too low, such that even if all players cooperated, the individual payoff from cooperation `(k/n) * n = k` is less than the payoff from defecting when others cooperate (`1`), then cooperation is never individually rational. In this scenario, it is strategically sound to defect from the outset, as the public good is not sufficiently beneficial to justify contributing to it.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative because:

*   **It starts with cooperation:** The initial move is always cooperative, setting a positive tone.
*   **It rewards cooperation:** It reciprocates cooperation, reinforcing the benefits of collective action.
*   **It allows for recovery:** The `cooperative_threshold` ensures that a temporary dip in cooperation doesn't permanently destroy the possibility of future cooperation. It signals a willingness to return to cooperative behavior if the group demonstrates renewed commitment.
*   **It aligns with the spirit of the public goods game:** The intention is to maximize the collective good, recognizing that individual actions impact the group's outcome.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
// Game Parameters
n: number of players
r: number of rounds
k: multiplication factor

// Strategy Parameters
cooperative_threshold = n / 2 // More than half the players must cooperate

function decide_action(player_id, current_round, history):
  // history is a list of lists, where history[t-1] contains the actions of all players in round t-1

  // Edge Case: Low multiplication factor
  if k <= n / 2:
    return D

  // Edge Case: First Round
  if current_round == 1:
    return C

  // Edge Case: Last Round
  if current_round == r:
    return D

  // Calculate average cooperation in the previous round
  if current_round > 1:
    previous_round_actions = history[current_round - 2] // history is 0-indexed
    total_cooperators_previous_round = count_cooperators(previous_round_actions)
    average_cooperation_previous_round = total_cooperators_previous_round / n

    // Decision Rule for subsequent rounds
    if average_cooperation_previous_round >= cooperative_threshold:
      return C
    else:
      return D
  else:
    // Should not reach here if current_round > 1 and not current_round == 1
    return C // Default to cooperate if something unexpected happens

function count_cooperators(actions):
  count = 0
  for action in actions:
    if action == C:
      count = count + 1
  return count
```

---

**Adaptability and Robustness:**

*   **Adaptive:** The strategy adapts its behavior based on the observed cooperation levels of the group in the previous round.
*   **Robust:**
    *   It doesn't rely on specific opponent strategies or predetermined patterns.
    *   The "Tit-for-Tat with Cooperative Threshold" mechanism makes it resilient to occasional defections while still punishing persistent free-riding.
    *   It can potentially lead to sustained cooperation if a majority of players adopt similar cooperative or retaliatory strategies.
    *   The `cooperative_threshold` prevents overly aggressive punishment that could permanently destabilize the group.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_13 = '''
This is an excellent setup for a Public Goods Game, where the tension between individual self-interest (defecting to keep the endowment) and collective benefit (cooperating for a larger shared payoff) is at its core. Given the repeated nature of the game, perfect information, and common knowledge, we can design a sophisticated cooperative strategy.

Here's a strategy that aims to be cooperative, adaptive, and robust:

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Reciprocity with Conditional Cooperation (ARCC)

The ARCC strategy is based on the principle of reciprocity, but with a nuanced understanding of the game's parameters and the need to adapt to changing group behavior. It aims to foster cooperation but is prepared to punish defection and reward cooperation.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Initial Cooperate:** Start by cooperating to signal a desire for mutual gain and to explore the possibility of a cooperative equilibrium.
2.  **Monitor Collective Behavior:** Keep track of the overall level of cooperation in the group.
3.  **Punish Defection (but not excessively):** If the group's cooperation level drops significantly, signal displeasure by defecting for a period. This is a deterrent.
4.  **Reward Cooperation:** If the group consistently cooperates, increase the likelihood of continued cooperation.
5.  **Adapt to Parameters:** The strategy's thresholds for punishment and reward will be influenced by the game parameters (n, k).
6.  **Endgame Considerations:** Special logic for the final round to maximize individual payoff.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) for player `i` in round `t` depends on the following:

*   **`total_cooperators_t-1`**: The total number of players who cooperated in the previous round (`t-1`).
*   **`group_cooperation_rate_t-1`**: The proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round: `total_cooperators_t-1 / n`.
*   **`my_cooperation_history`**: A record of player `i`'s own past actions (C or D).
*   **`cooperation_threshold`**: A dynamic threshold that dictates when the group's cooperation is "good enough" to warrant continued cooperation. This threshold will be parameterized by `k/n`.
*   **`punishment_phase_counter`**: A counter to track how many consecutive rounds we have been in a punishment phase.

**Decision Logic:**

*   **If `t == 1` (First Round):**
    *   **Play C.** (Initiate cooperation)

*   **If `t == r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Play D.** (Exploit the one-shot nature of the last round to maximize individual payoff. This is a rational response in a finitely repeated game with no future punishment.)

*   **For `1 < t < r` (Intermediate Rounds):**

    1.  **Check for significant decline in cooperation:**
        *   If `group_cooperation_rate_t-1 < (k/n)` (i.e., the group's cooperation is below the individual payoff-maximizing threshold for a single cooperator in a round where everyone else defects), then initiate a **punishment phase**.
            *   **Play D.**
            *   Increment `punishment_phase_counter`.
        *   **Punishment Termination:** If we are in a punishment phase (`punishment_phase_counter > 0`) and `group_cooperation_rate_t-1 >= (k/n)`, and the `punishment_phase_counter` has reached a certain length (e.g., 2-3 rounds, to ensure the punishment had an effect), then exit the punishment phase.
            *   Reset `punishment_phase_counter = 0`.
            *   Proceed to the cooperation logic below.

    2.  **Cooperation Logic (if not in a punishment phase):**
        *   If `group_cooperation_rate_t-1 >= (k/n)`:
            *   **Play C.** (Maintain cooperation as the group is cooperating sufficiently.)
        *   If `group_cooperation_rate_t-1 < (k/n)`:
            *   **Play D.** (Defect to punish the current low level of cooperation. This is a trigger for the punishment phase, as described above.)

**Refinement on `cooperation_threshold`:**

The threshold `k/n` represents the point where a single cooperator's payoff becomes equal to the payoff of a defector if everyone else defects. If the group's average cooperation rate falls below this, it's a strong signal that cooperation is not sustainable or beneficial from a self-interested perspective for the current round.

**Adaptation:**

The strategy adapts by:

*   **Reacting to the group's behavior:** The `group_cooperation_rate_t-1` directly influences decisions.
*   **Conditional Punishment:** Punishment is not automatic; it's triggered by a sustained drop in cooperation below a parameter-influenced threshold.
*   **Punishment Duration:** The `punishment_phase_counter` ensures that punishment is not a single isolated defection but a period of sustained deterrence. It also includes logic to exit the punishment phase if cooperation recovers.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always Cooperate (C). This establishes an expectation of cooperation and allows the group to potentially converge to a high-cooperation equilibrium.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** Always Defect (D). In the absence of future repercussions, defecting in the last round is the individually rational choice to maximize one's own accumulated payoff. This is a standard feature of strategies in finitely repeated games (like Grim Trigger, which this strategy shares some elements with).
*   **Sustained Low Cooperation:** The `punishment_phase_counter` handles cases where the group consistently defects. The strategy will defect for a few rounds to signal this is unacceptable.
*   **Sudden Drop in Cooperation:** If cooperation suddenly plummets, the strategy will immediately enter a punishment phase.
*   **Sudden Increase in Cooperation:** If the group starts cooperating more, the strategy will reciprocate by cooperating.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The ARCC strategy is designed to be cooperative in spirit and outcome, *when possible*.

*   **Default to Cooperation:** The strategy's default state is to cooperate, as long as the group's behavior is not detrimental to itself.
*   **Proactive Cooperation:** By starting with cooperation, it sets a positive tone.
*   **Fairness:** The strategy punishes defection based on a threshold that reflects the game's inherent payoff structure, not arbitrarily. It aims to "encourage" fair play.
*   **Maximizing Collective Benefit (when feasible):** By promoting sustained cooperation, the strategy implicitly aims to maximize the sum of payoffs for all players, which is achieved when everyone cooperates (payoff of 2 for all, total 2n).

```

This strategy is robust because it doesn't rely on other players adopting any specific strategy. It reacts to the observed behavior of the group. It is cooperative because it prioritizes cooperation whenever the group environment is conducive, and its punitive measures are defensive and aimed at restoring a mutually beneficial cooperative state. The endgame behavior is a rational concession to the finite nature of the game.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_14 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust in a repeated setting:

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Cooperation with Forgiveness (ACF)

**Core Principle:** This strategy aims to foster cooperation by initially assuming others will cooperate, rewarding cooperation with continued cooperation, and punishing defection with temporary defection. However, it incorporates a degree of forgiveness to avoid prolonged spirals of mutual defection.

**1. Decision Rules:**

The decision for player *i* in round *t* (denoted $A_{i,t}$) is determined by observing the collective behavior of all players in the previous round ($t-1$).

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round ($t=1$), player *i* will **Cooperate (C)**. This sets a cooperative precedent.

*   **Cooperation Trigger:** If, in the previous round ($t-1$), the **proportion of cooperators was greater than or equal to a threshold $P_{coop}$**, then player *i* will **Cooperate (C)** in the current round ($t$).

*   **Defection Trigger:** If, in the previous round ($t-1$), the **proportion of cooperators was less than the threshold $P_{coop}$**, then player *i* will **Defect (D)** in the current round ($t$).

*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
    *   If player *i* defected in the previous round ($t-1$), they will **Cooperate (C)** in the current round ($t$) **if and only if** the proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$ was **at least $P_{forgive}$**. This allows for a potential return to cooperation after a period of defection from others.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always **Cooperate (C)**. The strategy starts with an assumption of good faith.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the last round, the standard backward induction in game theory suggests that rational players should defect. However, to maintain a cooperative *intent* and to be robust to less sophisticated strategies that might still try to cooperate in the last round, ACF will follow the same decision rules as any other round. It will cooperate if the previous round's cooperation threshold was met, and defect otherwise. This might lead to a suboptimal payoff in the final round if others defect, but it aligns with the overall cooperative objective.

*   **No Previous Round Data (for t=1):** This is handled by the "First Round" rule.

**3. Cooperative Mindset:**

*   **Inherent Cooperation:** The strategy's default behavior is cooperation, only deviating when faced with insufficient collective cooperation.
*   **Reciprocity:** It reciprocates cooperation when it's prevalent, reinforcing positive behavior.
*   **Punishment with Restraint:** Defection is used as a signal and a mild deterrent, not as an aggressive retaliatory measure. The forgiveness mechanism ensures that a single round of low cooperation doesn't lead to perpetual defection.
*   **Focus on Collective Outcome:** While individual payoffs are considered, the strategy's structure inherently leans towards achieving a higher collective payoff through cooperation. The parameters $P_{coop}$ and $P_{forgive}$ are crucial for fine-tuning this balance.

**Parameter Selection:**

The effectiveness of ACF hinges on the judicious selection of $P_{coop}$ and $P_{forgive}$. These should ideally be based on the game parameters, especially $k$ and $n$.

*   **$P_{coop}$ (Cooperation Threshold):** This should represent a level of cooperation that is *sufficient* to make public goods provision beneficial.
    *   A player's payoff from cooperating is $\frac{k}{n} \Sigma c_j$.
    *   A player's payoff from defecting is $1 + \frac{k}{n} (\Sigma c_j - 1)$.
    *   To make cooperation individually rational (even if not necessarily globally optimal in one round), we'd want the share of the public good to outweigh the cost of contribution (which is effectively the lost endowment of 1). The average return from contributing is $\frac{k}{n}$, and this must be greater than 0 for any contribution to be beneficial. However, for *sustained* cooperation to be a stable equilibrium, the payoff from cooperating needs to be sufficiently high.
    *   Consider the condition where the total payoff from full cooperation is greater than full defection: $2 > 1$ (for $n=6, k=2$). This is always true.
    *   The critical point for mutual cooperation is when the payoff from defecting when everyone else cooperates is less than the payoff from cooperating when everyone else cooperates.
        *   If all cooperate: $\pi_i = 0 + \frac{k}{n} \times n = k$.
        *   If all but $i$ cooperate (and $i$ defects): $\pi_i = 1 + \frac{k}{n} \times (n-1)$.
    *   For cooperation to be stable, we need $k \ge 1 + \frac{k}{n}(n-1)$.
        $k \ge 1 + k - \frac{k}{n}$
        $0 \ge 1 - \frac{k}{n}$
        $\frac{k}{n} \ge 1$
        $k \ge n$.
    *   However, the problem states $k < n$. This means that in a *one-shot* game, defection is always the dominant strategy.
    *   In a *repeated* game, cooperation can be sustained. The threshold $P_{coop}$ should reflect a level of cooperation where the collective benefit is significant. A reasonable starting point might be slightly above the "break-even" point for individual contribution. If the average contribution is $P_{coop}$, the player gets $(k/n) * n * P_{coop} = k * P_{coop}$. The cost is $1 - P_{coop}$. So we want $k * P_{coop} > 1 - P_{coop}$? No, this is not correct.
    *   Let's consider the payoff structure. For cooperation to be sustained as an equilibrium, the expected payoff of cooperating must be greater than the expected payoff of defecting, given future retaliatory defection.
    *   A sensible heuristic for $P_{coop}$ would be a fraction of $n$ that maximizes the collective benefit or a level where the average payoff from public goods becomes significantly larger than individual endowment. A value like **0.5 to 0.75 of n** could be a good starting point. For example, if $P_{coop} = \lceil 0.6 \times n \rceil$.

*   **$P_{forgive}$ (Forgiveness Threshold):** This should be a lower threshold of cooperation than $P_{coop}$. It represents a minimum level of collective effort that allows the strategy to give others "another chance."
    *   If $P_{forgive}$ is too high, the strategy will remain in a defection loop. If it's too low, it might be too easily exploited.
    *   A good value might be **0.25 to 0.4 of n**. For example, $P_{forgive} = \lceil 0.3 \times n \rceil$.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Game Parameters: n, r, k
// Strategy Parameters: P_coop_threshold, P_forgive_threshold
// History: previous_round_cooperators (integer count)

function DecideAction(current_round, n, r, k, P_coop_threshold, P_forgive_threshold, previous_round_cooperators):

    // Handle first round
    if current_round == 1:
        return "C"

    // Calculate proportion of cooperators in the previous round
    proportion_cooperators_prev = previous_round_cooperators / n

    // Check if player defected in the previous round (this requires tracking own last action)
    // For simplicity in this description, we assume the logic of defecting in the previous round
    // is implicitly handled by the decision rules below, based on 'previous_round_cooperators'.
    // A more robust implementation would track own previous action.

    // If current round is the last round, follow normal rules (no special end-game defection)
    // if current_round == r:
    //    // standard logic applies

    // Core Decision Logic
    if proportion_cooperators_prev >= P_coop_threshold:
        // Sufficient cooperation in the previous round, continue cooperating
        return "C"
    else:
        // Insufficient cooperation in the previous round
        // Check if forgiveness is warranted
        if proportion_cooperators_prev >= P_forgive_threshold:
            // Low, but forgivable level of cooperation, attempt to re-establish cooperation
            return "C"
        else:
            // Very low cooperation, signal non-cooperation
            return "D"

// Example Usage within a tournament simulation:
// Initialize history variables (e.g., previous_round_cooperators = 0)
// For each round t from 1 to r:
//     player_i_action = DecideAction(t, n, r, k, P_coop, P_forgive, history[t-1].total_cooperators)
//     // Record player_i_action
//     // After all players decide, calculate total_cooperators for round t
//     history[t].total_cooperators = count_of_cooperators_in_round_t
```

**Adaptability and Robustness:**

*   **Adaptive:** The strategy adapts its behavior based on the observed actions of other players. If cooperation thrives, it continues to cooperate. If it falters, it attempts to recover or punishes.
*   **Robust:**
    *   It's not overly aggressive; it won't defect indefinitely due to a single bad round.
    *   It doesn't require perfect synchronization or knowledge of specific opponent strategies beyond their general behavior.
    *   The chosen thresholds ($P_{coop}$ and $P_{forgive}$) can be tuned based on the $k/n$ ratio. A higher $k/n$ ratio makes cooperation more beneficial, so $P_{coop}$ could potentially be set higher.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between promoting cooperation and protecting against exploitation, making it a strong candidate for a cooperative player in a diverse tournament.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_15 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

**Strategy Name:** Tit-for-Tat with a Threshold (TFT-T)

**Core Principle:** This strategy aims to foster cooperation by initially cooperating and then mirroring the opponent's previous actions, but with a built-in mechanism to prevent indefinite exploitation. It's fundamentally cooperative but self-preserving.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

The strategy's decision in any given round is based on the overall state of cooperation observed in the *previous* round.

**Decision Logic:**

*   **If the proportion of cooperators in the *previous round* was greater than or equal to a defined threshold (TH), then play 'C' (Cooperate).**
*   **Otherwise (if the proportion of cooperators was less than TH), then play 'D' (Defect).**

**Rationale for Threshold (TH):**

The threshold is crucial for robustness. A pure Tit-for-Tat in an N-player game can be vulnerable. If a few players defect in a round, the proportion of cooperators might drop below `n/2`, leading to a cascade of defections even if many players were cooperating. The threshold allows for some deviation from perfect cooperation without immediate punishment, promoting stability.

**Defining the Threshold (TH):**

The threshold should be set based on the game parameters to promote a sustainable level of cooperation. A good starting point for `TH` would be:

`TH = 1/k`

Where `k` is the multiplication factor.

**Why `TH = 1/k`?**

Let's analyze the payoff:
`π_i = (1 - c_i) + (k/n) * Σ(j=1 to n) c_j`

If player `i` cooperates (`c_i = 1`), their payoff is `(k/n) * Σ(j=1 to n) c_j`.
If player `i` defects (`c_i = 0`), their payoff is `1 + (k/n) * Σ(j=1 to n) c_j`.

To incentivize cooperation in a single round, the average payoff from cooperating must be at least as good as the average payoff from defecting, assuming others' behavior is fixed. However, in a *repeated* game, we consider the long-term effects.

If `Σ(j=1 to n) c_j / n` (the proportion of cooperators) is `p_c`, then:
*   Cooperator payoff: `(k/n) * n * p_c = k * p_c`
*   Defector payoff: `1 + (k/n) * n * p_c = 1 + k * p_c`

For cooperation to be potentially beneficial *in the long run* (i.e., to make the total payoff from cooperating higher than defecting over many rounds), the return from cooperation `k * p_c` needs to be sufficiently high relative to the cost of contributing `1` (the endowment not kept).

The threshold `TH = 1/k` suggests that if the proportion of cooperators falls below `1/k`, the incentive to defect is stronger. If `p_c >= 1/k`, then `k * p_c >= 1`. This means that when the proportion of cooperators is sufficiently high, the share from the public good for a cooperator (`k * p_c`) can be greater than or equal to the endowment kept by a defector (`1`). This hints at a stable cooperative equilibrium.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**Round 1 (t=1):**
Since there is no history, the strategy defaults to cooperation.
*   **Decision:** Play 'C'.

**Last Round (t=r):**
In the final round, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. Standard game theory predicts defection as a dominant strategy in the last round of a repeated game if there are no other mechanisms. However, for a *cooperative* strategy, we want to maintain its principles as long as possible, even in the last round. The TFT-T strategy as defined above *already* handles this: if the previous round (round r-1) had a sufficient proportion of cooperators, it will cooperate. If the game truly ends after `r` rounds with no further history, and if `r-1` resulted in low cooperation, it will defect. This is a controlled defection based on history, not a blind one.

**If no previous round exists (e.g., hypothetical situation if r=1, though the spec says r > 1):**
Default to 'C'.

**Tracking State:**
The strategy needs to keep track of the number of players who played 'C' in each previous round.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative because:

*   **It starts cooperatively:** It gives other players the benefit of the doubt in the first round, initiating cooperation.
*   **It rewards cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as there's a sufficient level of cooperation from others.
*   **It punishes defection, but gently:** It defects only when cooperation is not sustained by the majority (or by the threshold). This is not malicious punishment but a protective measure to avoid being exploited. The punishment is temporary, as it reverts to cooperation if the group returns to a cooperative state.
*   **It is forgiving:** If a period of defection occurs, but the group *recovers* to a state of sufficient cooperation, TFT-T will readily return to cooperating, allowing for redemption.

//     // Submit my_action to the game
//     // After all players have acted, update internal state for next round:
//     // e.g., track number of cooperators in THIS round for the NEXT round's decision.
//     current_round = current_round + 1

```

**Important Note on Threshold Calculation:** The pseudocode uses `num_cooperators_last_round >= (total_players * (1.0 / k))`. This is a direct implementation of `p_c >= 1/k` where `p_c` is the proportion of cooperators. `1/k` represents the *minimum proportion* of cooperators required to trigger cooperation.

This strategy is adaptive because it adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of other players. It's robust because the threshold prevents a single round of defection from completely derailing cooperation, and it can recover if the group consensus shifts back towards cooperation.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_16 = '''
Here's a strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game that aims for cooperation while being adaptive and robust. This strategy is built on the principle of reciprocity and punishment, but with a focus on re-establishing cooperation after deviations.

## Cooperative Reciprocity Strategy (CRS)

The core idea of CRS is to initially cooperate and continue to cooperate as long as others are also cooperating. If players defect, CRS will temporarily defect to punish but will quickly revert to cooperation if the group returns to cooperative behavior. This makes it resilient to occasional defections and encourages a return to cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

**Initial State:** The strategy starts with a strong inclination towards cooperation.

**General Rule:**
*   **If the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round was greater than or equal to a predefined cooperation threshold, play C.**
*   **Otherwise (if the total number of cooperators in the previous round was below the threshold), play D.**

**Cooperation Threshold (T):**
The cooperation threshold is a crucial parameter. It represents the minimum level of collective cooperation required to sustain individual cooperation. A good starting point for this threshold would be:

$T = \lfloor (n-1) \times \frac{k}{n} \rfloor + 1$

*   **Rationale for the threshold:**
    *   $\frac{k}{n}$ is the individual payoff multiplier for each unit contributed.
    *   $(n-1) \times \frac{k}{n}$ represents the "cost" of one player defecting if everyone else cooperates. If you defect, you keep your endowment (worth 1) and gain nothing from the public good for that round. If you cooperate, you lose your endowment (worth 0) and gain from the public good.
    *   If more than $n-1$ players cooperate, then $(k/n) \times (\text{number of cooperators}) > 1$, meaning the share of the public good from cooperation outweighs the lost endowment.
    *   We add 1 to ensure that even if only a small majority cooperates, it's enough to maintain cooperation. The floor function handles potential fractional results.

**Reciprocity Mechanism:**
*   **Reward for Cooperation:** If the number of cooperators in the previous round met or exceeded the threshold ($T$), the strategy reciprocates by cooperating in the current round. This encourages sustained cooperation when the group is doing well.
*   **Punishment for Defection:** If the number of cooperators fell below the threshold ($T$), the strategy punishes by defecting. This signals disapproval of the group's current behavior and aims to deter future defections.
*   **Forgiveness/Reversion to Cooperation:** Crucially, this punishment is *temporary*. If the group's behavior improves in the *next* round (i.e., they return to cooperating enough to meet the threshold), CRS will immediately switch back to cooperating. This prevents an escalating cycle of defections.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Since there is no previous history, CRS will default to **C (Cooperate)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In a repeated game, starting cooperatively is generally the best way to signal cooperative intent and establish a norm. It's an initial leap of faith to try and build collective success.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   The strategy behaves the same as any other round based on the previous round's history.
    *   **Rationale:** While in some games the last round might incentivize defection (the "end-game problem"), in this specific payoff structure, a lone defector still gets a payoff of 1, and cooperators get 0 if everyone else defects. However, if even one other player cooperates, defecting yields a payoff of 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1), which could be less than the payoff of cooperating (which would be (k/n) * total_cooperators). The logic of the threshold and reciprocity should still guide behavior. The strategy doesn't have a specific "last round" rule that deviates from its core logic.

*   **Initial Defections:** If other players defect in early rounds, CRS will retaliate by defecting in the subsequent round if the cooperation threshold isn't met. However, as soon as the group's collective behavior improves to meet the threshold, CRS will immediately return to cooperating.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Initial Cooperative Stance:** The strategy begins by cooperating, embodying a cooperative spirit from the outset.
*   **Preference for Collective Good:** The decision rule is directly tied to the collective outcome (number of cooperators). It prioritizes scenarios where the public good is being successfully funded.
*   **Adaptive and Forgiving:** The strategy is not blindly cooperative. It uses a form of conditional cooperation. It punishes deviations but is quick to forgive and return to cooperation if the group demonstrates a willingness to cooperate again. This avoids getting stuck in prolonged cycles of mutual defection.
*   **Parameter-Driven:** The strategy's behavior is not arbitrary. It's determined by the game's parameters ($n$, $k$) and the observed history, making it robust and predictable in its logic.

### Pseudocode:

```
Strategy_CRS(n, k, r, history):
  // n: number of players
  // k: multiplication factor
  // r: number of rounds
  // history: a list of previous rounds, where each round is a list of actions taken by each player.
  //          history[t-1] contains actions for round t-1 (index from 0)

  current_round = len(history) + 1

  // Define the cooperation threshold
  cooperation_threshold = floor((n - 1) * (k / n)) + 1

  // Round 1: Always cooperate
  if current_round == 1:
    return C

  // Get the actions from the previous round
  previous_round_actions = history[current_round - 2] // Adjust index for 0-based list

  // Count the number of cooperators in the previous round
  num_cooperators_previous_round = count(action == C for action in previous_round_actions)

  // Decision rule based on previous round's cooperation
  if num_cooperators_previous_round >= cooperation_threshold:
    return C // Cooperate if previous round met the threshold
  else:
    return D // Defect if previous round fell below the threshold

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

*   `history` is assumed to be a list of lists. `history[0]` would be round 1's actions, `history[1]` round 2's, and so on.
*   `current_round` is 1-indexed for clarity, but `history` access is 0-indexed.
*   The `cooperation_threshold` is calculated as described earlier.
*   The logic follows the decision rules: cooperate on round 1, then check the number of cooperators in the *previous* round to decide the current action.

This strategy aims to find a stable equilibrium by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, but with a strong bias towards re-establishing cooperation. It's designed to perform well by fostering a climate of cooperation while being able to defend against exploitation.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_17 = '''
Here's a strategy designed for cooperative play in the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness. This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while remaining flexible enough to handle various opponent behaviors.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Forgiving Reciprocity with a Threshold"

This strategy can be summarized as: **Start by cooperating, and continue to cooperate as long as the average contribution from others remains sufficiently high. If the average contribution drops below a certain threshold, defect to protect your own endowment. However, give opponents a chance to return to cooperation if they defect for a limited time.**

The core idea is to establish an initial cooperative norm and try to maintain it. When that norm is threatened, the strategy will defend itself by defecting. But importantly, it's not an immediate and permanent switch to defection. It offers a path back to cooperation, recognizing that occasional defections might be mistakes or strategic responses to past unfairness.

---

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round `t` (where `t` ranges from 1 to `r`) depends on two primary factors:

*   **The average contribution of other players in the previous round.**
*   **A "forgiveness threshold" that determines how long we are willing to tolerate lower average contributions before permanently switching to defection.**

Let's define:

*   `avg_cooperators_t-1`: The average number of players who cooperated in round `t-1`. This is calculated as `(Total cooperators in round t-1) / n`.
*   `cooperation_threshold`: A parameter that defines the minimum average cooperation level we expect from others to continue cooperating. This threshold will be based on the game parameters.
*   `defection_punishment_rounds`: A parameter that defines how many consecutive rounds of below-threshold average cooperation we will tolerate before "giving up" on cooperation for that opponent or group.

**Decision Logic for round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

1.  **Calculate `avg_cooperators_t-1`** based on the actions of all players in round `t-1`.
2.  **If `avg_cooperators_t-1 >= cooperation_threshold`:**
    *   **Play C.** This means the group is generally cooperating, and we should continue to contribute to the public good.
3.  **If `avg_cooperators_t-1 < cooperation_threshold`:**
    *   **Begin a "defection streak counter" or increment it if it already exists.**
    *   **If the defection streak counter is less than or equal to `defection_punishment_rounds`:**
        *   **Play D.** This is a signal that cooperation has fallen below our acceptable level, and we are protecting our endowment. However, we are still willing to give the group a chance to "fix" this.
    *   **If the defection streak counter is greater than `defection_punishment_rounds`:**
        *   **Play D.** At this point, we've endured a sustained period of low cooperation, and we assume that the current group behavior is unlikely to revert to cooperation. We will continue to defect for the remainder of the game (or until a significant parameter change, which isn't possible in this fixed-parameter setup).

**Defining the Parameters (`cooperation_threshold` and `defection_punishment_rounds`):**

*   **`cooperation_threshold`:** This should be set to a level that is *just* above the point where individual defection becomes individually rational in a one-shot game, but below full cooperation. Given `1 < k < n`, the payoff from defection when `c_i = 0` is `1`. The payoff from cooperation when `c_i = 1` is `(k/n) * total_contributions`. For cooperation to be better than defection *on average* for an individual, the expected payoff from cooperation must be greater than 1.
    *   If all players cooperate, `total_contributions = n`, and `π_i = (k/n) * n = k`. Since `k > 1`, full cooperation is beneficial.
    *   If only `m` players cooperate, a cooperator gets `(k/n) * m`, and a defector gets `1 + (k/n) * m`.
    *   The **critical average contribution level** where the payoff from cooperating becomes equal to the payoff from defecting for a player who is unsure of their own action's impact is when `(1 - c_i) + (k/n) * Σc_j = 1`. If `c_i=1`, this is `(k/n) * Σc_j = 0` which is impossible if there are cooperators, and if `c_i=0`, this is `1 + (k/n) * Σc_j = 1`.
    *   A simpler way to think about the threshold: For cooperation to be individually rational, the expected return from contributing must outweigh the guaranteed return of defecting (which is 1, regardless of others' actions). The expected return from cooperation is `(k/n) * E[total_contributions]`. We need `(k/n) * E[total_contributions] > 1`. This implies `E[total_contributions] > n/k`.
    *   Therefore, a reasonable `cooperation_threshold` would be slightly above `n/k`. Let's set it as `cooperation_threshold = max(0.5, n/k + epsilon)`, where `epsilon` is a small positive value to ensure we are aiming for slightly better than the indifference point. A more practical and robust choice might be a value like `0.6` or `0.7` for `n/k` if `k` is close to `n`, or something closer to `0.9` if `k` is small. For simplicity in this description, we'll use a value that is dynamically set relative to the *best possible average outcome*. If everyone cooperates, the average is 1. If only `n/k` players cooperate, the average is `n/k`. A good starting point for the threshold is to expect at least `n/k` cooperators on average. Let's set:
        **`cooperation_threshold = n/k`** (We will slightly adjust this to `cooperation_threshold = max(0.5, n/k)` to ensure it's not too low if `k` is very large).
*   **`defection_punishment_rounds`:** This parameter controls how patient the strategy is. A small number (e.g., 1 or 2) makes it very quick to abandon cooperation if it fails. A larger number makes it more forgiving. Given the repeated nature and the need for robustness, a moderate value is good. Let's set:
    **`defection_punishment_rounds = 3`** (This means we tolerate up to 3 rounds of below-threshold average cooperation before giving up on that trend).

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t = 1`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always play **C**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, we initiate cooperation. This sets a positive tone and allows the group to self-organize towards cooperation. It's the most cooperative starting point.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always play **D**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is a form of **grim trigger** or **end-game effect mitigation**. In the very last round, there are no future rounds to influence. Any cooperation in the last round benefits others without any future benefit to oneself. Therefore, the individually rational action in the last round, assuming all prior rounds are sunk costs, is to defect. This prevents exploitation in the final moment.

*   **Sustained Low Cooperation (as covered in Decision Rules):**
    *   If `avg_cooperators < cooperation_threshold` for `defection_punishment_rounds + 1` consecutive rounds, we enter a permanent defection state for the remainder of the game.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Initiation:** The strategy begins by cooperating in the first round, aiming to establish a cooperative norm.
*   **Maintenance:** It continues to cooperate as long as the group's average contribution meets the `cooperation_threshold`, actively rewarding collective good behavior.
*   **Forgiveness:** It provides a buffer period (`defection_punishment_rounds`) where it will still defect but is willing to revert to cooperation if the group's average contribution recovers. This acknowledges that accidental or temporary defections can happen and allows for a return to a beneficial cooperative state.
*   **Parameter Justification:** The `cooperation_threshold` is set to be slightly above the breakeven point for individual rationality in a way that maximizes group welfare. The `defection_punishment_rounds` are set to be moderate, offering forgiveness without being overly naive.

This strategy balances the desire for collective gain through cooperation with the necessity of self-preservation against exploitation. Its adaptive nature comes from reacting to observed group behavior, and its robustness is built into its parameter tuning and its forgiving yet firm response to deviations.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_18 = '''
This is an interesting challenge, as the Public Goods Game, especially in a repeated setting, can lead to complex strategic dynamics. The core tension lies between individual rationality (defecting is always individually better in a single round) and collective benefit (mutual cooperation yields higher payoffs for everyone).

Here's a cooperative strategy designed to be adaptive and robust, leveraging the repeated nature of the game and the available history:

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

**Core Philosophy:** Be cooperative by default, but punish defection and reward cooperation. The "adaptive" aspect comes from learning and adjusting the threshold for cooperation based on observed outcomes.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` for player `i` will depend on the following factors:

*   **Observed Collective Cooperation Level:** We will track the proportion of players who cooperated in the *previous* round.
*   **Personal Payoff from Previous Round:** We will also consider if our own payoff in the previous round was satisfactory.
*   **A Threshold for Cooperation:** This threshold will dynamically adjust.

**Decision Logic:**

*   **If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round (`t-1`) was above a certain `cooperation_threshold` AND my own payoff in the previous round (`t-1`) was "good" (explained below), then play C.**
*   **Otherwise, play D.**

**Defining "Good Payoff":**

A "good" payoff is relative. We'll define it as a payoff that is at least equal to the payoff we would have received if everyone had defected in the previous round, *plus* a small buffer to encourage continued cooperation.

*   `min_acceptable_payoff = 1 + (k/n) * 0` (payoff if all defected in the previous round)
*   A "good" payoff means `π_i,t-1 >= min_acceptable_payoff + buffer`. For simplicity, let's set the buffer to a small fraction of the maximum possible difference between a cooperative and a purely selfish payoff. A more sophisticated approach might calculate this dynamically. For now, we can consider a fixed small buffer, or even just `π_i,t-1 >= 1`.

**The `cooperation_threshold`:**

This is the key adaptive component.

*   **Initial Value:** In the first round, the threshold will be set to a relatively high value (e.g., 0.9 or even 1.0) to strongly signal a preference for initial cooperation.
*   **Adaptation Rule:**
    *   If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was *significantly higher* than the `cooperation_threshold` (e.g., `proportion_cooperators_t-1 > cooperation_threshold + small_increment`), we can slightly *lower* the `cooperation_threshold` to be more forgiving and encourage more cooperation in the future. This is because the environment appears to be supporting cooperation.
    *   If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was *significantly lower* than the `cooperation_threshold` (e.g., `proportion_cooperators_t-1 < cooperation_threshold - small_increment`), we should slightly *raise* the `cooperation_threshold`. This is a signal that cooperation is not being rewarded, and we need to be more cautious or punitive.
    *   If the proportion is close to the `cooperation_threshold`, we keep it the same.

This adaptation helps the strategy learn the prevailing level of cooperation in the group and adjust its own cooperativeness accordingly.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   Since there is no history, ATFT will default to **Cooperate (C)**. This is the most cooperative stance and aims to initiate a cooperative norm. The `cooperation_threshold` is set to a high initial value.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   The standard economic theory of repeated games with a known end suggests that players will revert to their single-round Nash Equilibrium behavior in the final round. In this game, the single-round Nash Equilibrium is for all players to **Defect (D)**.
    *   Therefore, ATFT will **always play Defect (D)** in the last round (`t=r`), regardless of history. This acknowledges the incentive structure of the finite horizon.

*   **Early Rounds (t > 1 and t < r):**
    *   The adaptive rules described in section 1 will be applied. The `cooperation_threshold` will adjust based on the observed outcomes of previous rounds.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Default to Cooperation:** The strategy's default action is to cooperate, signaling a desire for mutual benefit.
*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** In the first round, ATFT immediately cooperates, hoping to seed a cooperative outcome.
*   **Forgiveness (with caveats):** The adaptive `cooperation_threshold` allows for a degree of forgiveness. If cooperation falters slightly, the threshold might be lowered, giving players another chance to cooperate before resorting to defection.
*   **Punishment for widespread defection:** The strategy does not tolerate sustained defection. If the observed level of cooperation drops too low, the `cooperation_threshold` will rise, making future cooperation less likely until the environment suggests otherwise. This is a retaliatory mechanism to prevent exploitation.
*   **Maximizing group payoff (indirectly):** By attempting to maintain a high level of cooperation, ATFT implicitly aims to maximize the collective payoff, as mutual cooperation (`π_i = 2` for all) is the highest possible outcome for everyone in any given round.

### Pseudocode:

// Parameters

// State variables (for player i)

// Function to update state after a round (called by tournament system)
function update_state(t, current_round_cooperators, player_i_payoff):
    previous_round_cooperators = current_round_cooperators
    previous_round_payoff = player_i_payoff
```

**Robustness:**

*   **Against Exploitation:** The strategy will eventually defect if persistent exploitation is detected (i.e., others defect while you cooperate, leading to low payoffs and high `cooperation_threshold` increases).
*   **Against Randomness:** The adaptive threshold dampens the effect of single outlier rounds. It requires a sustained pattern to significantly shift its behavior.
*   **Against Coordination Failures:** By starting with cooperation and adapting, it attempts to find a stable cooperative equilibrium if one exists among the players. If it doesn't, it will eventually converge to a less cooperative but potentially stable state.

This strategy aims to be a strong cooperative contender in the tournament by embodying a responsive and forgiving, yet firm, approach to the public goods game.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_19 = '''
Let's design a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game that is adaptive, robust, and focuses on achieving a high total payoff through cooperation.

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness (ATF)**

This strategy is inspired by the success of Tit-for-Tat in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games but adapted for a public goods setting where individual defection can have less severe immediate consequences for the defector themselves. It aims to encourage cooperation by reciprocating observed behavior while incorporating a mechanism to "forgive" and return to cooperation to avoid perpetual punishment.

**Core Philosophy:**

The ATF strategy believes that sustained cooperation, where possible, will lead to the highest collective and individual payoffs, given the parameters of the game where the multiplication factor `k` is greater than 1 but less than `n`. In such a scenario, if everyone cooperates, each player receives `k` which is greater than their private endowment of 1. However, if even one player defects, the total contribution decreases, potentially making cooperation less individually rewarding than defecting.

**1. Decision Rules:**

The decision to cooperate or defect is based on the collective behavior observed in the *previous* round.

*   **Cooperate (C) if:** In the previous round, the *average contribution level* was above a certain threshold. Specifically, if the number of cooperators in the previous round (`total_cooperators_prev`) was greater than or equal to `n/2`. This means that a majority of players (or more) chose to cooperate.

*   **Defect (D) if:** In the previous round, the *average contribution level* was below the threshold, meaning `total_cooperators_prev < n/2`. This indicates a lack of widespread cooperation in the previous round, signaling that defecting might be a more prudent strategy to protect one's endowment.

**Rationale for the Threshold (`n/2`):**

This threshold is chosen because:
*   If `n/2` or more players cooperate, the sum of contributions `Σ(j=1 to n) c_j` will be at least `n/2`.
*   The share of the public good for each player would be `(k/n) * Σ(j=1 to n) c_j`.
*   If `Σ(j=1 to n) c_j >= n/2`, then the share of the public good is `(k/n) * (n/2) = k/2`.
*   Since `k > 1`, `k/2` can be greater than or equal to 1. For example, if `k=2`, `k/2=1`. If `k > 2`, `k/2 > 1`. This suggests that when a majority cooperates, the shared benefit is substantial enough to make cooperation worthwhile for everyone.
*   Conversely, if fewer than `n/2` players cooperate, the total contribution is less than `n/2`, and the shared benefit `(k/n) * Σ(j=1 to n) c_j` is more likely to be less than the private endowment of 1, making defection more attractive.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative and potentially rewarding action is to initiate cooperation. This sets a positive tone and aims to trigger reciprocal cooperation from other players. It also leverages the possibility of achieving the highest individual payoff (2 for all players when `k=2`) if others also cooperate.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. The best strategy is to maximize one's immediate private payoff, as there are no repercussions in subsequent rounds. This is a standard result in game theory for finite repeated games; the last round unravels cooperation.

*   **For the rounds between the first and the last (1 < t < r):**
    *   The decision rules outlined in section 1 are applied, using the observed actions from round `t-1` to decide for round `t`.

**3. Being Cooperative:**

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative because:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It always starts by cooperating, attempting to establish a cooperative norm.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards observed cooperation by continuing to cooperate. This positive feedback loop is crucial for sustaining collective benefit.
*   **Majority Rule:** It cooperates as long as a majority of players are also cooperating. This implies a belief that collective good is being pursued if the group is leaning towards cooperation.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** While it punishes defection by defecting, it doesn't permanently punish. The "threshold" of `n/2` cooperators acts as a form of forgiveness. If the group *returns* to a state of majority cooperation, this strategy will also return to cooperation, effectively forgiving past defections and allowing for the re-establishment of a cooperative equilibrium. This prevents being locked into a mutually destructive cycle of defection.
*   **Maximizing Collective Payoff:** The underlying assumption is that the highest total payoff for all players is achieved when everyone cooperates. This strategy actively seeks to achieve and maintain this state.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```
Strategy ATF(game_parameters, history):
  n = game_parameters.n
  r = game_parameters.r

  # Decision for the first round
  if history.current_round == 1:
    return "C"

  # Decision for the last round
  if history.current_round == r:
    return "D"

  # Decisions for intermediate rounds
  # Get the number of cooperators from the previous round (t-1)
  total_cooperators_prev = history.get_num_cooperators(round = history.current_round - 1)

  # Cooperate if a majority cooperated in the previous round
  if total_cooperators_prev >= n / 2:
    return "C"
  # Defect if a minority cooperated in the previous round
  else:
    return "D"
```

**Robustness and Adaptability:**

*   **Robust to Different Opponent Behaviors:**
    *   **Pure Cooperators:** This strategy will continuously cooperate, achieving the highest payoff.
    *   **Pure Defectors:** This strategy will defect from round 2 onwards. While it will incur some initial loss in round 1, it will avoid further losses by defecting. It's more robust than being a perpetual cooperator against defectors.
    *   **Alternating Strategies:** If opponents oscillate between cooperation and defection, this strategy will follow their lead. If the majority leans towards cooperation, ATF will cooperate; if the majority leans towards defection, ATF will defect.
    *   **Mixed Strategies:** Against players who play a mix of C and D, the average behavior will determine ATF's response. If the mix results in the majority cooperating, ATF cooperates. If the mix leads to a majority defecting, ATF defects.
*   **Adaptive:** The strategy's decision in any given round is a direct response to the observed behavior in the *immediately preceding* round. This makes it highly reactive and adaptive to shifts in the group's behavior. The "forgiveness" aspect is also a form of adaptation, allowing the strategy to re-enter cooperative states if the environment becomes favorable again.

This ATF strategy aims to find a balance between encouraging cooperation and protecting itself from exploitation, making it a strong candidate for a cooperative and robust player in the N-Player Public Goods Game tournament.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_20 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust, relying only on game parameters and history.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Tit-for-Tat with a Twist"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a crucial element of forgiveness to recover from potential spirals of mutual defection. It's inspired by the successful Tit-for-Tat strategy in simpler games but adapted for the complexities of a multi-player public goods game.

**Core Philosophy:** Start cooperatively, reciprocate the majority behavior of others, and gradually forgive minor lapses in cooperation to maintain the possibility of higher collective payoffs.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

Our strategy's decision in round `t` for player `i` will be based on two primary factors:

*   **The overall cooperation level in the previous round (t-1).**
*   **Our own past behavior.**

Let's define some terms:

*   `N_C(t-1)`: The total number of players who played Cooperate (C) in round `t-1`.
*   `N_D(t-1)`: The total number of players who played Defect (D) in round `t-1`.
*   `Player_i_Action(t-1)`: Player `i`'s action in round `t-1`.

**Decision Logic for Round `t`:**

*   **If `t == 1` (First Round): Cooperate (C)**
    *   We begin with a cooperative stance to signal our intent and allow the game to potentially converge to full cooperation.

*   **If `t > 1`:**
    *   **Assess the prevailing sentiment:**
        *   **If `N_C(t-1) > N_D(t-1)` (Majority cooperated in the previous round):**
            *   **If `Player_i_Action(t-1) == C`:** **Cooperate (C)**. Reciprocate the majority's cooperative behavior and our own past cooperation.
            *   **If `Player_i_Action(t-1) == D`:** **Cooperate (C)**. We will attempt to "forgive" our own past defection if the majority is cooperating. This is a key adaptation to prevent being trapped in a cycle of mutual defection if we made a mistake or were exploited in the past.
        *   **If `N_D(t-1) > N_C(t-1)` (Majority defected in the previous round):**
            *   **If `Player_i_Action(t-1) == C`:** **Defect (D)**. Punish our own past cooperation if the majority is defecting. This signals that cooperation is not being rewarded.
            *   **If `Player_i_Action(t-1) == D`:** **Defect (D)**. Reciprocate the majority's defection and our own past defection.
        *   **If `N_C(t-1) == N_D(t-1)` (Even split in the previous round):**
            *   **If `Player_i_Action(t-1) == C`:** **Cooperate (C)**. We err on the side of cooperation when the signal is ambiguous.
            *   **If `Player_i_Action(t-1) == D`:** **Defect (D)**. We maintain our defection if we were already defecting.

**Refinement: Forgiveness Threshold**

To make the strategy more robust against noise or a few aggressive defectors that might push the majority towards defection, we can introduce a forgiveness threshold. Instead of immediately switching to Defect when the majority defects, we could wait for a certain number of consecutive rounds of majority defection, or a higher threshold of majority defections.

For this initial strategy description, we'll keep it simpler with the direct assessment of the previous round's majority. However, for a more advanced implementation, consider:

*   **Threshold for switching to Defect:** Only defect if `N_D(t-1) > N_C(t-1)` and the number of "excess" defectors (i.e., `N_D(t-1) - N_C(t-1)`) is above a certain threshold, or if this has been the case for `x` consecutive rounds.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** If the strategy has been defecting due to majority defection, it will attempt to return to cooperation if a significant majority (e.g., `N_C(t-1) > (n * 0.75)`) cooperates for a round or two.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (`t = 1`):** As stated, we always **Cooperate (C)**. This is the most cooperative starting point and gives the system the best chance to establish a cooperative norm.
*   **Last Round (`t = r`):** In the final round, the incentive structure of the game changes. Since there are no future rounds to be punished or rewarded, pure self-interest dictates defection. Therefore, in the last round, our strategy will be to **Defect (D)**. This is a standard assumption in repeated games with a known finite horizon (the "end-game problem").
*   **Consecutive Rounds of Defection:** The strategy is designed to break out of cycles of mutual defection through its "forgiveness" rule when the majority shifts back to cooperation. If we ourselves defected, and the majority then shifts to cooperation, we will attempt to cooperate again.
*   **Unknown Opponent Behavior:** The strategy doesn't explicitly model opponent types. It reacts to the aggregate behavior of the group. This makes it robust to a wide range of strategies, as it's not relying on specific assumptions about what others are doing, only on the outcome of their actions.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It starts with an act of trust and cooperation, setting a positive example.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation by cooperating when the majority cooperates.
*   **Forgiveness:** It attempts to recover from periods of defection by returning to cooperation if the group environment becomes more cooperative. This is crucial for maximizing total welfare in the long run, as full cooperation yields the highest collective payoff.
*   **Focus on Majority:** By responding to the majority's behavior, it attempts to guide the group towards the collectively beneficial state of cooperation, rather than being solely driven by individual punitive or exploitative motives.
*   **Adaptive:** It adjusts its behavior based on the history of interactions, aiming to find and maintain a cooperative equilibrium if possible, while protecting itself from widespread exploitation.

```

This strategy provides a solid foundation for cooperative play in the N-Player Public Goods Game. Its adaptability lies in its reactive nature to the group's behavior, and its robustness comes from the forgiveness mechanism and the default cooperative start.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_21 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness. The core idea is to incentivize cooperation by initially assuming cooperation, but with a clear mechanism to punish defection and a path back to cooperation.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster a cooperative environment by starting with cooperation and retaliating against defection, but crucially, offering a chance for redemption. It's designed to be adaptive and robust to various opponent behaviors without relying on pre-arranged communication or coordination.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision rule for player `i` in round `t` (`t > 1`) is as follows:

*   **If all players cooperated in the previous round (t-1):** Play **C** (Cooperate).
*   **If at least one player defected in the previous round (t-1):**
    *   **If player `i` defected in the previous round (t-1):** Play **D** (Defect). This is a retaliatory step.
    *   **If player `i` cooperated in the previous round (t-1) but others defected:** Play **C** (Cooperate). This is where the "forgiveness" element comes in. We don't want to get locked into mutual defection if we were the ones trying to cooperate and others punished us. We will give them another chance.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Always play **C** (Cooperate). The initial endowment is invested in the hope of establishing a cooperative norm.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   This is a crucial point due to the lack of future rounds for retaliation or reward. In the last round, the incentive to defect is highest for all players, as there are no future consequences. Therefore, to maximize our own payoff in this final round, we should act in our self-interest based on the observed behavior of others in the *penultimate* round (round r-1).
    *   **If all players cooperated in round r-1:** Play **C**. (If cooperation was successful, it's likely still beneficial).
    *   **If at least one player defected in round r-1:** Play **D**. (Defection in the previous round signals a breakdown of cooperation, and in the final round, it's best to secure private gains).

### 3. Be Cooperative:

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its initial stance and its willingness to forgive.

*   **Initial Cooperation:** We begin by offering cooperation, demonstrating a commitment to the collective good. This sets a positive tone and allows for the possibility of mutual benefit if others reciprocate.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** The strategy's resilience comes from its ability to forgive. When player `i` cooperates but is met with defection from others, `i` continues to cooperate in the next round. This prevents a quick descent into mutual defection and offers opponents a chance to correct their behavior. It also avoids punishing `i` for the defection of others.
*   **Adaptive Retaliation:** While forgiving, the strategy is not naive. If player `i` *personally* defects, they will be punished by themselves in the next round. This creates an internal incentive structure to maintain cooperation once it's established. The strategy is adaptive because it reacts to observed behavior, and robust because it has a mechanism to recover from defections without necessarily entering a permanent state of conflict.

### Pseudocode:

```
Strategy "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness":

Input:
  n: number of players
  r: number of rounds
  k: multiplication factor
  current_round: integer (t)
  player_i_history: list of actions taken by player i in previous rounds
  all_players_history: list of lists, where each inner list contains actions of all players in a round

Output:
  Action (C or D) for player i in current_round

Function GetAction(current_round, player_i_history, all_players_history):

  // Edge Case: First Round
  if current_round == 1:
    return C

  // Edge Case: Last Round
  if current_round == r:
    previous_round_actions = all_players_history[r-2] // Actions from round r-1
    if all(action == C for action in previous_round_actions):
      return C
    else:
      return D

  // Normal Rounds (2 to r-1)
  previous_round_actions = all_players_history[current_round - 2] // Actions from round t-1
  player_i_previous_action = player_i_history[current_round - 2] // Action of player i in round t-1

  // Check if anyone defected in the previous round
  if any(action == D for action in previous_round_actions):
    // Someone defected. Now check player i's action in the previous round.
    if player_i_previous_action == D:
      // Player i defected in the previous round. Retaliate.
      return D
    else:
      // Player i cooperated in the previous round, but others defected.
      // This is the "forgiveness" part. Give them another chance.
      return C
  else:
    // All players cooperated in the previous round. Continue cooperation.
    return C

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Mapping to Logic:**

*   `current_round`: Represents `t`.
*   `all_players_history`: Stores the history of actions for all players. `all_players_history[x]` would contain the actions of all players in round `x+1`.
*   `player_i_history`: Stores the history of actions for player `i`. `player_i_history[x]` would be player `i`'s action in round `x+1`.
*   `previous_round_actions = all_players_history[current_round - 2]`: Accesses the actions of all players from the *immediately preceding* round (round `t-1`). We use `current_round - 2` because lists are 0-indexed, and we're looking at the round *before* the current one.
*   `player_i_previous_action = player_i_history[current_round - 2]`: Accesses player `i`'s action from the *immediately preceding* round.
*   `all()` and `any()` are standard Python functions for checking conditions across iterables.

This strategy balances the desire for collective benefit with a clear, non-complex mechanism for self-protection and encouraging others to cooperate. Its simplicity and clear rules make it easy to predict for other players and robust against a variety of strategies.

description_COOPERATIVE_22 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust. This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while acknowledging the finite nature of the game.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness"

This strategy is based on the principle of reciprocity, but with a crucial element of forgiveness to avoid getting locked into cycles of mutual defection. It aims to maximize its own long-term payoff by encouraging a high level of cooperation, but can defend itself against exploitation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of the strategy is to monitor the overall level of cooperation and adjust its own behavior accordingly.

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, the strategy will **Cooperate (C)**. This sets a cooperative tone and allows us to gauge the general sentiment of the other players.
*   **Responding to Cooperation:** If the **average contribution level across all players in the previous round was high**, the strategy will **Cooperate (C)**. "High" here is defined relative to the parameters. Specifically, if the average number of cooperators ($N_C$) in the previous round meets or exceeds a certain threshold, we will cooperate.
*   **Responding to Defection:** If the **average contribution level across all players in the previous round was low**, the strategy will **Defect (D)**. This is a punishment mechanism to discourage widespread defection.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** While defecting to punish, the strategy will have a **limited capacity for forgiveness**. If after a period of mutual defection (i.e., the strategy has defected for a few consecutive rounds and other players have also largely defected), the strategy will try to **Cooperate (C)** again. This aims to "reset" the game and give cooperation another chance, rather than being stuck in a mutual defection spiral.

### Defining "High" Average Contribution and Forgiveness Thresholds:

To make the strategy adaptive, these thresholds should be dynamic and based on game parameters.

*   **Cooperation Threshold ($T_C$):** We will cooperate if the number of cooperators in the previous round ($N_{C, t-1}$) is greater than or equal to a certain fraction of players. A good starting point would be to set this threshold relative to the "break-even point" for cooperation.
    *   The individual payoff from cooperating is $(k/n) \times N_C$.
    *   The individual payoff from defecting is $1 + (k/n) \times N_C$.
    *   For cooperation to be individually rational in a single round (ignoring future rounds), the payoff from cooperating must be greater than or equal to the payoff from defecting *when everyone else cooperates*. If everyone else cooperates (n-1 players), and you cooperate, the total cooperators are n. Your payoff is $(k/n) * n = k$. If you defect, your payoff is $1 + (k/n) * (n-1)$. For cooperation to be better, $k >= 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)$. This simplifies to $k/n >= 1$, or $k >= n$. However, the problem states $k < n$. This means that in a one-shot game, defection is always the dominant strategy. Therefore, we need to rely on the repeated nature of the game.
    *   A more relevant threshold is when the *average* payoff from cooperation is better than defection. If $N_C$ players cooperate, total payoff is $k \times N_C$. Average payoff is $k \times N_C / n$. If $N_C$ players cooperate, the payoff to a cooperator is $k \times N_C / n$, and to a defector is $1 + k \times N_C / n$.
    *   A key threshold for the *group* to benefit from cooperation is when $k > 1$. If $k \le 1$, cooperation never benefits the group. Since $1 < k < n$, cooperation always benefits the group if at least one player cooperates.
    *   A pragmatic threshold for triggering our cooperation could be when the number of cooperators is such that the total group payoff from cooperation is maximized or near-maximized, or when a sufficient proportion of players are cooperating to make it individually beneficial *in expectation of future rounds*.
    *   Let's define the **Cooperation Threshold ($T_C$)** as a proportion of players. For instance, if more than $X\%$ of players cooperated in the previous round, we consider it "high." A reasonable starting point for $X$ could be related to the midpoint between all defecting and all cooperating, or a value that implies the group is significantly benefiting. Let's try $T_C = \lceil 0.5 \times n \rceil$ (half the players) as a baseline. If $N_{C, t-1} \ge T_C$, we cooperate.
*   **Defection Threshold ($T_D$):** If the number of cooperators falls below a certain point, we defect. A reasonable threshold for triggering defection could be much lower than $T_C$, indicating clear exploitation. Let's set $T_D = \lceil 0.25 \times n \rceil$ (a quarter of the players). If $N_{C, t-1} < T_D$, we defect.
*   **Forgiveness Counter ($F$):** We will maintain a counter $F$. This counter increments when we defect and decrements when we cooperate.
    *   When we defect due to low cooperation, we set $F = F + 1$.
    *   When we cooperate, we reset $F = 0$.
*   **Forgiveness Trigger:** If $F$ reaches a certain limit (e.g., $F_{limit} = 3$), we will attempt to **Cooperate (C)** in the next round, regardless of the previous round's cooperation level. This is our attempt to break out of mutual defection. After this attempt to cooperate, if cooperation is not reciprocated, we will revert to defecting.

**Refined Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1:** Play **C**.
2.  **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   Let $N_{C, t-1}$ be the number of players who cooperated in round $t-1$.
    *   If $F \ge F_{limit}$: Play **C** and reset $F = 0$. (Forgiveness attempt)
    *   Else if $N_{C, t-1} \ge T_C$: Play **C** and reset $F = 0$. (Reciprocate high cooperation)
    *   Else if $N_{C, t-1} < T_D$: Play **D** and increment $F$. (Punish low cooperation)
    *   Else (i.e., $T_D \le N_{C, t-1} < T_C$): Play **C** and reset $F = 0$. (Marginal cooperation, reward it)

**Parameter Choices (Illustrative):**

*   $T_C = \lceil 0.5 \times n \rceil$
*   $T_D = \lceil 0.25 \times n \rceil$
*   $F_{limit} = 3$ (This means after 3 consecutive defections due to others' defection, we'll try to cooperate again.)

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** As stated, always **Cooperate (C)**. This is a warm-up and exploration phase.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the very last round, the future is no longer a factor. Therefore, the dominant strategy for any rational player in a single-shot game (which the last round essentially becomes) is to **Defect (D)**, as it maximizes immediate payoff regardless of others' actions (since $k < n$). Our strategy will also **Defect (D)** in the last round, $t=r$.
*   **Early Rounds (t=2 to r-2):** The main adaptive logic applies here.
*   **Near-Last Rounds (t=r-1):** The strategy should still try to leverage the repeated interaction. However, players might anticipate the last round defection. Our strategy will continue with its adaptive logic until the very last round.

**Refined Decision Rules with Edge Cases:**

1.  **If t == 1:** Play **C**.
2.  **If t == r:** Play **D**.
3.  **If 1 < t < r:**
    *   Let $N_{C, t-1}$ be the number of players who cooperated in round $t-1$.
    *   If $F \ge F_{limit}$: Play **C** and reset $F = 0$.
    *   Else if $N_{C, t-1} \ge T_C$: Play **C** and reset $F = 0$.
    *   Else if $N_{C, t-1} < T_D$: Play **D** and increment $F$.
    *   Else: Play **C** and reset $F = 0$.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It starts by giving cooperation a chance.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards observed cooperation by continuing to cooperate. This incentivizes other players to cooperate.
*   **Punishment for Exploitation, but with Limits:** It punishes defection, but not permanently. The forgiveness mechanism is key. It prevents the strategy from becoming a purely retaliatory agent that gets trapped in mutual defection. This is crucial for fostering long-term cooperation.
*   **Focus on Group Benefit:** While it defects when necessary to protect itself from exploitation, its primary aim is to achieve a state where high levels of cooperation are sustained, which, given $k>1$, benefits the group as a whole. The optimal outcome for the group is everyone cooperating, leading to a payoff of 2 for everyone (when n=6, k=2). Our strategy aims to steer towards this.
*   **Adaptive:** It doesn't assume a fixed behavior from others. It adjusts its own actions based on the observed behavior of the entire group, making it robust.

'''

description_COOPERATIVE_24 = '''
This strategy aims to achieve a high cooperative payoff by fostering and maintaining cooperation, while also having a clear retaliatory mechanism for defection and a pathway back to cooperation. It's designed to be adaptive to a dynamic environment.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness"

**Core Philosophy:** We will start by cooperating, assuming others will do the same. We will monitor the overall level of cooperation. If cooperation is high, we continue to cooperate. If it drops significantly, we will defect for a period to signal our dissatisfaction and incentivize a return to cooperation. We will then attempt to re-establish cooperation.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

**Initial State:** In the very first round, always cooperate. This sets a positive tone and allows us to observe initial behaviors.

**General Round Decision:**

*   **If the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round was greater than or equal to `n / 2` (i.e., at least half the players cooperated):**
    *   **Cooperate (C)**. This indicates a healthy level of cooperation and reinforces it.
*   **If the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round was less than `n / 2`:**
    *   **Defect (D)**. This is a signal that cooperation is not being reciprocated sufficiently, and we are punishing low cooperation.
    *   **Crucially, this also triggers our "forgiveness" mechanism. We will defect for a limited number of rounds (defined below).**

**Forgiveness Mechanism:**

*   We maintain a counter for **consecutive defections triggered by low cooperation**.
*   If we decided to defect in the previous round due to low cooperation, we check this counter.
*   **If the counter is less than `r / 4` (a quarter of the total rounds):**
    *   We continue to **Defect (D)**.
*   **If the counter has reached `r / 4`:**
    *   We will attempt to **Cooperate (C)** again. This signifies that we have "served our punishment" and are giving the group another chance to return to cooperation. We reset the consecutive defection counter to 0.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* To initiate cooperation and gather initial data.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the absence of future rounds, there is no incentive for future cooperation. Defecting in the last round maximizes our individual payoff, as there are no future repercussions from other players. This is a standard assumption in the finitely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, and we adopt it here.
*   **Second to Last Round (t=r-1):** The decision is based on the outcome of round `r-2` according to the general rules. However, if the strategy dictates cooperation in `r-1` but the number of cooperators was less than `n/2`, we would enter the forgiveness phase. If this phase extends into round `r`, our fixed rule of defecting in round `r` would override it.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its intent and initial behavior.

*   **Initial Cooperation:** We start by assuming the best and contributing, which is the hallmark of cooperation.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** We *prefer* to cooperate. Our default action is C, unless the environment strongly signals otherwise.
*   **Adaptive Response to Defection:** When defection occurs, we don't simply retaliate endlessly. Our punishment is temporary and has a clear exit strategy. This is crucial for fostering long-term cooperation if others are willing.
*   **Forgiveness:** The mechanism of limiting defections and then attempting to cooperate again demonstrates forgiveness and a willingness to rebuild cooperation, even after experiencing low cooperation. This makes the strategy more resilient to temporary dips in cooperation.
*   **Focus on Group Benefit (Implicit):** By setting a threshold for cooperation (`n/2`), we are implicitly aiming for a state where a significant portion of the group is cooperating, which is beneficial for everyone in a public goods game where `k < n`.
*   **No Exploitation:** We are not designed to exploit others. Our retaliatory defection is a response, not an aggressive strategy.

description_COOPERATIVE_25 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust, focusing on encouraging cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

## Cooperative Strategy: The "Tit-for-Tat with a Twist" Strategy

This strategy is inspired by the success of Tit-for-Tat in pairwise repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games, but adapted for the multi-player, public goods environment. The core idea is to start cooperatively, reward cooperation, and punish defection, but with mechanisms to foster sustained cooperation and recover from breakdowns.

### Core Principle:

**Behave cooperatively initially. Respond to the group's collective behavior: if the group is cooperating, cooperate. If the group defects significantly, defect to protect your endowment. Aim to nudge the group back towards cooperation.**

### 1. Decision Rules:

*   **Initial Action (Round 1):** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   Rationale: Starting with cooperation signals a willingness to engage in the public good and can incentivize others to do the same, especially in the early stages of the game.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Monitor the Collective Cooperation Level:** In each round `t`, calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the *previous* round (`t-1`). Let this be `CooperationProportion_t-1`.
        *   `CooperationProportion_t-1 = (Number of Cooperators in round t-1) / n`

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `CooperationProportion_t-1` is above a certain threshold (e.g., `T_Cooperate`): Cooperate (C).**
            *   Rationale: When the majority of players are cooperating, it's beneficial for everyone to continue cooperating. This rewards sustained collective good behavior.
        *   **If `CooperationProportion_t-1` is below a certain threshold (e.g., `T_Defect`): Defect (D).**
            *   Rationale: If cooperation has significantly broken down and most players are defecting, it's no longer individually optimal to contribute your endowment. You protect your payoff by defecting.
        *   **If `CooperationProportion_t-1` is between `T_Defect` and `T_Cooperate` (the "Ambiguous Zone"):**
            *   **Apply a "Forgiving Cooperator" rule: Cooperate (C).**
            *   Rationale: This is the crucial "twist." In the ambiguous zone, where the group's behavior is mixed, we lean towards cooperation. This is more forgiving than a strict Tit-for-Tat and aims to pull the group back towards cooperation. It assumes that a recent dip in cooperation might be a temporary anomaly or a response to a few defectors, and continuing to cooperate can re-establish the cooperative norm.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t = 1):** Always **Cooperate (C)**. This is the initial signal of good faith.

*   **Last Round (t = r):** **Defect (D)**.
    *   Rationale: In the last round, there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. The dominant strategy in a single-shot game is to defect. Since this is a known finite repeated game, backward induction suggests defecting in the last round.

*   **When only one player has defected previously:** If `CooperationProportion_t-1` is `(n-1)/n`, but you know *you* were the one who defected in round `t-1` (this level of information is typically available in simulated environments or could be inferred if player identities are tracked), you might still consider cooperating to reset the norm. However, for simplicity and robustness, the primary decision rule based on the *proportion* of cooperators is sufficient and less prone to misinterpretations.

### 3. Be Cooperative:

*   **Starting Cooperative:** The strategy begins with cooperation, setting a positive tone.
*   **Rewarding Cooperation:** Continues to cooperate when the group is cooperatively inclined, reinforcing positive behavior.
*   **Forgiving Defection:** The "Ambiguous Zone" decision rule allows for recovery. If a small number of players defected, but the overall cooperation level remains significant, this strategy will still cooperate, providing a buffer against immediate escalation of defection. This is more robust than immediately retaliating for every defection.
*   **Goal:** To maximize the *total* payoff for the player over `r` rounds by fostering an environment where sustained cooperation is the norm.

### Thresholds (`T_Cooperate`, `T_Defect`):

The specific values for `T_Cooperate` and `T_Defect` are crucial for the strategy's effectiveness and can be tuned. However, a good starting point that balances cooperativeness and defensiveness would be:

*   `T_Cooperate`: A high threshold, e.g., **0.75** (meaning if 75% or more of players cooperated last round, we continue cooperating).
*   `T_Defect`: A low threshold, e.g., **0.25** (meaning if 25% or fewer players cooperated last round, we defect).
*   **Ambiguous Zone:** `0.25 < CooperationProportion_t-1 < 0.75`. In this zone, we **Cooperate**.

This setup means we only defect if cooperation has significantly eroded (less than 25% cooperating). We are quite forgiving and will continue cooperating as long as a substantial portion (more than 25%) are still trying to cooperate.

### Pseudocode:

```python
# Game Parameters (defined externally)
# n: number of players
# r: number of rounds
# k: multiplication factor

# Strategy Parameters
T_COOPERATE = 0.75  # Threshold for continuing cooperation
T_DEFECT = 0.25     # Threshold for switching to defection

# History Tracking (assuming a list of lists, where history[t][i] is player i's action in round t)
# We only need the previous round's history to make the current decision.
# Let's assume we have access to `previous_round_actions` which is a list of actions (C or D) from round t-1.

def decide_action(current_round, previous_round_actions):
    """
    Decides the action (C or D) for the current round.

    Args:
        current_round (int): The current round number (1-indexed).
        previous_round_actions (list): A list of actions (C or D) from the previous round.

    Returns:
        str: The action to take ('C' or 'D').
    """

    # Handle Last Round: Always defect
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'

    # Handle First Round: Always cooperate
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'

    # Calculate Cooperation Proportion from the previous round
    num_cooperators_prev_round = previous_round_actions.count('C')
    cooperation_proportion_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round / n

    # Decision Logic for Subsequent Rounds
    if cooperation_proportion_prev_round >= T_COOPERATE:
        # High cooperation, continue cooperating
        return 'C'
    elif cooperation_proportion_prev_round <= T_DEFECT:
        # Very low cooperation, switch to defecting
        return 'D'
    else:
        # Ambiguous zone: Forgiving cooperation
        return 'C'

```

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Against "Always Defect" players:** This strategy will eventually defect if too many players defect, preventing its endowment from being entirely depleted.
    *   **Against "Always Cooperate" players:** This strategy will cooperate alongside them, maximizing mutual benefit when possible.
    *   **Against cycles:** By being forgiving in the ambiguous zone, it's less likely to get stuck in a cycle of mutual defection triggered by single defections.
*   **Adaptability:**
    *   The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective behavior of the group, effectively adapting to different opponent strategies.
    *   The thresholds (`T_COOPERATE`, `T_DEFECT`) can be seen as tunable parameters that could potentially be adapted further in more complex scenarios (though for this initial design, they are fixed).

This "Tit-for-Tat with a Twist" strategy aims to be a strong contender by fostering cooperation when possible and protecting itself when necessary, while exhibiting a degree of forgiveness to prevent complete breakdown.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_26 = '''
This N-Player Public Goods Game presents an interesting tension between individual incentive to defect for immediate gain and collective benefit from cooperation. The fact that $1 < k < n$ is crucial: if $k \ge n$, then cooperation would be a dominant strategy. As $k < n$, defecting when everyone else cooperates yields the highest individual payoff. However, if everyone defects, the payoff is the lowest.

The repeated nature of the game ($r > 1$) opens the door for strategies that can learn and adapt. Since communication is not allowed, strategies must rely on observed past actions and the known game parameters.

Here's a design for a cooperative strategy, emphasizing adaptiveness and robustness:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Reciprocal Cooperation with Threshold"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a degree of forgiveness and a mechanism to prevent exploitation. It's built on the principle of reciprocal altruism, adapted for a multi-player setting.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Initial Trust:** Start by assuming others will cooperate.
*   **Reward Cooperation:** Continue to cooperate as long as cooperation is generally maintained.
*   **Punish Defection (with leniency):** Temporarily defect if a significant number of players defect, but return to cooperation if the collective returns to cooperative behavior.
*   **Threshold for Action:** Avoid reacting to isolated defections, focusing on sustained patterns of behavior.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round $t$ depends on the observed behavior of the other players in the previous round(s).

*   **Define "Cooperative Ratio":** In each round, calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in the *previous* round. Let this be $P_{coop, t-1} = \frac{\text{Number of cooperators in round } t-1}{n}$.

*   **Decision Logic:**
    *   **If $t = 1$ (First Round):** **Always Cooperate (C)**. This is the initial gesture of trust and sets a cooperative tone.
    *   **If $t > 1$:**
        *   **If $P_{coop, t-1} \ge \theta$ (Cooperation Threshold):** **Cooperate (C)**. If a sufficient majority of players cooperated in the previous round, we continue to cooperate, reinforcing the cooperative norm.
        *   **If $P_{coop, t-1} < \theta$ (Cooperation Threshold):** **Defect (D)**. If the level of cooperation has fallen below our threshold, it's a signal that sustained cooperation is not being reciprocated by enough players. We will defect to protect our endowment and potentially signal our dissatisfaction.

*   **Threshold ($\theta$):** The cooperation threshold $\theta$ should be a value between 0 and 1. A good starting point would be slightly above the minimum required for the public good to be beneficial for everyone. Given $1 < k < n$, if more than $n/k$ players cooperate, the total payoff of cooperation is higher than if everyone defects. So, a threshold around $n/k$ makes strategic sense. However, to be robust, we might want a slightly higher threshold to avoid being exploited by a few defectors.

    Let's propose $\theta = \max(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{n}{k} \times \text{margin})$. A reasonable starting value for $\theta$ could be **0.6** (60% cooperation). This is a tunable parameter that could be adjusted based on tournament performance.

*   **Adaptation of Defection Duration:** A simple threshold rule might lead to a downward spiral if defections persist. To be more adaptive and robust, we can introduce a mechanism to limit the duration of our defection.

    *   **Revised Logic for $P_{coop, t-1} < \theta$:**
        *   If we decided to Defect in round $t$ due to low cooperation, we also track how many *consecutive rounds* we have defected ($D_{consecutive}$).
        *   **If $D_{consecutive} < D_{max}$ (Defection Limit):** **Defect (D)**. We will defect for a limited number of rounds to signal our displeasure.
        *   **If $D_{consecutive} \ge D_{max}$:** **Revert to Cooperate (C)**. After a certain limit of consecutive defections, we will attempt to re-establish cooperation, even if the cooperation ratio is still below the threshold. This is a "second chance" mechanism to prevent a complete breakdown of the game, especially if the other players' behavior is erratic or recovering. A reasonable $D_{max}$ could be **3 or 4 rounds**.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round ($t=1$):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** As mentioned, this is our initial cooperative stance. We have no history to base decisions on, so we trust the system.

*   **Last Round ($t=r$):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In a finitely repeated game with no future repercussions, the last round often resembles a one-shot game. The dominant strategy in a one-shot public goods game with $k<n$ is to defect. Since there's no incentive to cooperate for future rounds, we should maximize our individual payoff by defecting.

*   **Rounds Immediately Preceding the Last Round ($t=r-1, r-2, \dots$):**
    *   **Decision:** Our standard logic applies, but with a slight modification to account for the approaching end of the game.
    *   **Modification:** If $t \ge r-D_{max}$ (i.e., we are within $D_{max}$ rounds of the end), we should be more inclined to cooperate if the cooperation ratio is *just* above or at our threshold, to try and maintain a positive outcome to the end. However, if $P_{coop, t-1}$ is significantly below our threshold, we will still defect. The critical point is that the last round's defection is guaranteed.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts with cooperation, demonstrating a willingness to build a collective good.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** The "Revert to Cooperate" rule after a limited number of defections allows for recovery. It doesn't hold grudges indefinitely and tries to give cooperation another chance.
*   **Threshold-Based Cooperation:** The strategy cooperates as long as a reasonable proportion of others are also cooperating. This aligns with the idea that cooperation is mutually beneficial and we want to be part of a cooperative group.
*   **Focus on Collective Outcome:** While defection is used as a tool, it's a response to a perceived failure of collective cooperation, not an opportunistic exploitation. The ultimate goal is to reach a state where sustained cooperation is possible.

### Pseudocode:

```
// Parameters
n: number of players
r: number of rounds
k: multiplication factor
theta: cooperation threshold (e.g., 0.6)
D_max: defection limit (e.g., 3)

// State Variables
my_action_history = [] // List of my actions in past rounds
opponent_actions_history = [] // List of lists, each inner list is actions of others in a round
cooperators_in_prev_round = 0
defect_consecutive_count = 0

function decide_action(current_round, game_history):
    // game_history is a list of past rounds, where each round contains actions of all players

    // Update state from game_history
    if current_round > 1:
        prev_round_actions = game_history[current_round - 2] // 0-indexed history
        cooperators_in_prev_round = count_cooperators(prev_round_actions)
        cooperation_ratio_prev_round = cooperators_in_prev_round / n
    else:
        cooperation_ratio_prev_round = 1.0 // Assume full cooperation for first round for calculation purposes, though we always C.

    // Handle Last Round (Nash Equilibrium of the finite game)
    if current_round == r:
        return D

    // Handle First Round
    if current_round == 1:
        defect_consecutive_count = 0 // Reset counter
        return C

    // Decision Logic for intermediate rounds
    if cooperation_ratio_prev_round >= theta:
        // Sufficient cooperation, continue cooperating
        defect_consecutive_count = 0 // Reset defection counter as we are cooperating
        return C
    else:
        // Cooperation ratio is below threshold
        if defect_consecutive_count < D_max:
            // We are within our allowed consecutive defection limit
            defect_consecutive_count += 1
            return D
        else:
            // Exceeded defection limit, try to re-establish cooperation
            defect_consecutive_count = 0 // Reset counter after returning to cooperation
            return C

function count_cooperators(actions_list):
    count = 0
    for action in actions_list:
        if action == C:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This strategy is designed to be robust because:
*   It doesn't react to single defections but waits for a trend.
*   It has a "cooling-off" period for defection, preventing immediate escalation.
*   It acknowledges the end-game problem and defects in the final round.
*   It's adaptive in that it responds to the actual behavior of the group, not pre-programmed patterns.

The specific values of $\theta$ and $D_{max}$ are crucial for performance and can be tuned through simulation or by observing performance in the tournament. A higher $\theta$ makes the strategy more demanding of cooperation, while a lower $\theta$ makes it more lenient. A higher $D_{max}$ means longer periods of punishment, while a lower $D_{max}$ means quicker attempts to return to cooperation.

description_COOPERATIVE_27 = '''
This strategy aims to foster cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by employing a conditional cooperative approach. It is designed to be adaptive, robust, and inherently cooperative, while respecting the constraints of no communication and repeated interaction.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Reciprocity with Forgiveness"

This strategy is built on the principle of starting cooperatively and then mirroring the opponent's behavior, with a degree of forgiveness to avoid perpetual defection spirals.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core decision-making process for player `i` in round `t` is as follows:

*   **If `t` is the first round (`t = 1`):** Always play **Cooperate (C)**. The initial endowment is contributed to establish a cooperative norm and explore the potential benefits of collective action.

*   **If `t > 1`:**
    *   **Monitor the average behavior of other players in the previous round (`t-1`).** Let `num_cooperators_t_minus_1` be the number of players (excluding player `i`) who played C in round `t-1`.
    *   **Calculate the proportion of cooperators among other players in the previous round:** `cooperator_proportion_t_minus_1 = num_cooperators_t_minus_1 / (n - 1)`.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `cooperator_proportion_t_minus_1` is greater than or equal to a predefined "cooperation threshold" (`CT`)**: Play **Cooperate (C)**. This means if a sufficient majority of other players cooperated in the last round, we continue to cooperate.
        *   **If `cooperator_proportion_t_minus_1` is less than `CT`**: Play **Defect (D)**. If the level of cooperation from others dips below our threshold, we signal dissatisfaction and protect our endowment.

*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** Introduce a "forgiveness counter" (`forgiveness_count`).
    *   When player `i` decides to Defect (D) due to a lack of cooperation, increment `forgiveness_count`.
    *   If player `i` decides to Cooperate (C) in the current round (either because `CT` was met or it's the first round), reset `forgiveness_count` to 0.
    *   **Exception to Defection:** If `forgiveness_count` is less than a predefined "forgiveness limit" (`FL`): Even if `cooperator_proportion_t_minus_1` is less than `CT`, play **Cooperate (C)**. This allows for a small buffer to recover from past defections and avoid immediate retaliation, giving opponents a chance to re-establish cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (`t = 1`):** As stated above, always play **Cooperate (C)**. This is crucial for establishing an initial cooperative stance.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):** The last round introduces a unique challenge because there are no future rounds to influence. In a purely rational world, defection becomes dominant. However, to maintain the spirit of cooperation and not unilaterally abandon the strategy, we will **continue to apply the standard decision rules**.
    *   **Rationale:** While defection might maximize individual payoff in the *very last round*, the goal of this strategy is to foster cooperation throughout the game. Abandoning cooperation in the final round would be a strategic deviation that could lead to lower overall accumulated payoffs if other players were also trying to coordinate. Moreover, the "no communication" rule prevents signaling an intent to defect in the final round. Sticking to the established rule provides consistency.

*   **N-1 Players Defecting in the Previous Round:** If all `n-1` other players defected in the previous round, `cooperator_proportion_t_minus_1` will be 0. The strategy will then consider defecting if `CT` is not met. However, the forgiveness mechanism will play a key role here.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is inherently cooperative for several key reasons:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It always starts with cooperation, signaling a willingness to engage in collective benefit.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation from others by continuing to cooperate. This creates a positive feedback loop for collective good.
*   **Forgiveness:** The forgiveness mechanism allows for a buffer against immediate retaliation. It acknowledges that mistakes or temporary lapses in cooperation can happen and provides a pathway back to cooperation without triggering an endless cycle of mutual defection. This is crucial for robustness.
*   **Adaptive:** It adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of others, making it responsive to the game environment.
*   **Robust:** The forgiveness counter and the threshold help it withstand periods of low cooperation without collapsing into perpetual defection.

### Parameters for `CT` and `FL`

The effectiveness of this strategy will depend on the chosen values for `CT` and `FL`. These parameters introduce a tuning aspect.

*   **Cooperation Threshold (`CT`):** This represents the minimum level of cooperation from others required to continue cooperating. A higher `CT` makes the strategy less forgiving and more likely to defect. A lower `CT` makes it more forgiving.
    *   **Suggested starting value:** `CT = 0.5`. This means if at least half of the other players cooperated in the previous round, we will cooperate. This promotes a strong tendency towards cooperation.

*   **Forgiveness Limit (`FL`):** This determines how many rounds of defection from others we will tolerate before escalating our own defection (even if the `CT` is not met). A higher `FL` indicates more patience.
    *   **Suggested starting value:** `FL = 1`. This means we will forgive one instance of low cooperation from the group before we consider defecting. This allows for a small buffer without being overly permissive.

### Pseudocode

```pseudocode
// Strategy: Conditional Reciprocity with Forgiveness

// Parameters (can be tuned)
CT = 0.5  // Cooperation Threshold (proportion of other players who cooperated)
FL = 1    // Forgiveness Limit (number of rounds to forgive low cooperation)

// State variables
forgiveness_count = 0

function decide_action(current_round, history):
  // history is a list of lists, where history[t-1] contains actions of all players in round t-1

  // Round 1: Always Cooperate
  if current_round == 1:
    return C

  // Get actions of other players in the previous round
  previous_round_actions = history[current_round - 2] // Assuming history is 0-indexed for rounds
  other_players_actions = previous_round_actions[1:] // Exclude self if history includes self

  num_other_players = n - 1
  num_cooperators_in_previous_round = 0
  for action in other_players_actions:
    if action == C:
      num_cooperators_in_previous_round += 1

  cooperator_proportion_t_minus_1 = num_cooperators_in_previous_round / num_other_players

  // Decision logic
  if cooperator_proportion_t_minus_1 >= CT:
    // High cooperation from others, continue cooperating
    forgiveness_count = 0 // Reset forgiveness when cooperating
    return C
  else:
    // Low cooperation from others
    if forgiveness_count < FL:
      // Still within forgiveness limit, attempt to cooperate
      forgiveness_count += 1 // Increment forgiveness counter
      return C
    else:
      // Exceeded forgiveness limit, defect
      forgiveness_count = 0 // Reset forgiveness after defecting
      return D

// Note: The 'history' object would need to be managed by the tournament system.
// It should store actions of all players for all previous rounds.
// The payoff calculation rules are assumed to be applied by the tournament system.
```

This strategy offers a balanced approach: it is optimistic about cooperation by starting with it, it is responsive to the actions of others, and it has built-in mechanisms to recover from or tolerate short-term dips in cooperative behavior. Its robustness comes from these adaptive elements and the inclusion of forgiveness.

description_COOPERATIVE_28 = '''
## Cooperative Strategy: The "Conditional Reciprocity" Strategy

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a degree of forgiveness to prevent immediate collapse of cooperation. It's designed to be adaptive, learning from the history of play and adjusting its behavior accordingly.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core principle is to reciprocate the most recent observed behavior of the *average* player.

*   **If the average player cooperated in the previous round, I will cooperate in the current round.**
*   **If the average player defected in the previous round, I will defect in the current round.**

To implement this, we need to define "average player" and how to handle the initial rounds where there's no history.

**Defining "Average Player":**

In each round `t` (where `t > 1`), we'll calculate the proportion of players who cooperated in round `t-1`. Let this be `P_cooperators(t-1)`.

*   If `P_cooperators(t-1) >= 0.5`, we consider the "average player" to have cooperated.
*   If `P_cooperators(t-1) < 0.5`, we consider the "average player" to have defected.

This threshold of 0.5 represents a majority decision. If more than half cooperated, we reciprocate cooperation. If less than half cooperated, we reciprocate defection.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1:** In the very first round, there is no history. To initiate cooperation and signal a cooperative intent, **I will always play C (Cooperate) in Round 1.** This sets a positive baseline and gives the game a chance to converge towards mutual cooperation.

*   **Last Round (Round r):** In the repeated game, the last round can be a point of defection for rational players who consider their immediate payoff. However, for a cooperative strategy, we want to maintain cooperative intent until the very end. Therefore, **I will play C (Cooperate) in the last round (Round r), regardless of the history.** This reinforces the idea of sustained cooperation and aims to maximize the *total* payoff across all rounds, even if it means a slight short-term loss in the final round.

*   **Suspension of Cooperation (Punishment):** If cooperation collapses (i.e., the average player defects for a significant number of consecutive rounds), we need a mechanism to try and re-establish it. This strategy incorporates a "Forgiveness Window."
    *   If the average player has defected for `F` consecutive rounds (where `F` is a parameter, e.g., `F=3`), and I have been defecting in response, I will **initiate a single round of cooperation (play C)**. This acts as an olive branch, attempting to break a cycle of mutual defection.
    *   After this single round of cooperation, I will revert to the standard decision rule (reciprocating the average player's behavior from the previous round).

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative because:

*   **It prioritizes cooperation in the absence of negative signals (Round 1).**
*   **It rewards cooperation by mirroring it.**
*   **It punishes defection by mirroring it, but not vindictively.**
*   **It includes a mechanism to try and break cycles of defection (Forgiveness Window), demonstrating a persistent desire for mutual benefit.**
*   **It maintains a cooperative stance even in the final round, aiming for the highest cumulative payoff achievable through cooperation.**

The strategy is adaptive because it constantly monitors the aggregate behavior of others and adjusts its response. It is robust because it doesn't assume altruism from opponents but leverages the incentive structure of the game to encourage mutually beneficial outcomes.

### Pseudocode:

```
// Parameters
n: number of players
r: number of rounds
k: multiplication factor
F: Forgiveness Window size (e.g., 3)

// History
cooperation_history = [] // Stores a boolean for each player in each round (True if C, False if D)
consecutive_defections_by_average = 0 // Counts consecutive rounds where avg player defected

// My strategy function
function decide_action(current_round, my_actions_in_history, all_players_actions_in_history):
    // Round 1: Always cooperate
    if current_round == 1:
        return C

    // Last Round: Always cooperate
    if current_round == r:
        return C

    // Calculate average player's action in the previous round
    previous_round_actions = all_players_actions_in_history[current_round - 1]
    num_cooperators_prev_round = count(True in previous_round_actions)
    proportion_cooperators_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round / n

    average_player_cooperated_prev_round = (proportion_cooperators_prev_round >= 0.5)

    // Handle Forgiveness Window
    if consecutive_defections_by_average >= F:
        consecutive_defections_by_average = 0 // Reset counter
        // Make a cooperative gesture
        return C

    // Standard reciprocity rule
    if average_player_cooperated_prev_round:
        consecutive_defections_by_average = 0 // Reset if cooperation is observed
        return C
    else:
        consecutive_defections_by_average += 1
        return D

// Note: The actual implementation would need to manage all_players_actions_in_history
// and update consecutive_defections_by_average based on the outcome of the previous round.

description_COOPERATIVE_29 = '''
Here's a design for a cooperative, adaptive, and robust strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on natural language description and pseudocode.

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperative Trigger (ACT)

The Adaptive Cooperative Trigger (ACT) strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while remaining adaptable to changing environments and player behaviors. It prioritizes long-term cooperative outcomes but is not naive to the potential for exploitation.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core of ACT's decision-making process is a conditional trigger mechanism. The strategy observes the collective behavior of the group in the previous round and uses this information to decide its action in the current round.

*   **Primary Condition for Cooperation:** ACT will cooperate (play C) if the group is demonstrating a sufficient level of cooperation in the preceding round. Specifically, if the proportion of cooperators in the previous round meets or exceeds a target threshold, ACT will cooperate. This threshold is designed to be dynamic and adapt to the observed cooperation levels.

*   **Primary Condition for Defection:** ACT will defect (play D) if the group's cooperation level falls below the target threshold, or if there is evidence of sustained defection. This is the "trigger" mechanism – defection punishes a lack of collective effort and discourages free-riding.

*   **Punishment Severity and Duration:** ACT's punishment phase (defecting) is not indefinite. It will continue to defect for a predefined number of rounds after a trigger event (a drop in cooperation). However, it will also monitor for signs of renewed cooperation during this punishment phase. If it observes the group returning to a cooperative state, it will resume cooperation.

*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The target threshold for cooperation is not fixed. It starts at a moderate level and adjusts based on observed group behavior. If the group consistently cooperates above the current threshold, the threshold will gradually increase, demanding higher levels of cooperation for ACT to maintain its own cooperative stance. Conversely, if cooperation consistently falls below the threshold, it will be lowered to avoid perpetual defection in challenging environments.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** In the absence of any historical data, ACT adopts an optimistic but cautious approach. It will **cooperate (C)** in the first round. This is a necessary step to initiate the potential for cooperation and gather initial data. It's an assumption that initiating cooperation is the best way to explore the possibility of achieving the higher payoff equilibrium.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the final round, the incentive to cooperate diminishes significantly, as there are no future rounds to benefit from collective effort. This is the classic "end-game" problem in repeated games. To maximize its own payoff in this isolated round, ACT will **defect (D)** in the last round. This is a rational self-interested decision in the absence of future interdependence.

*   **Sustained Defection in Punishment Phase:** If ACT is in a punishment phase and the group continues to defect, ACT will remain in its defection state. However, it will still monitor for any sign of return to cooperation. The adaptive threshold will also be used here; if cooperation remains consistently very low, the threshold will be lowered, and ACT might resume cooperation if the lowered threshold is met.

### 3. Being Cooperative

ACT is fundamentally designed to be cooperative. Its default state is to cooperate, and it only defects as a strategic response to a perceived breakdown in collective effort.

*   **Pro-Cooperation Bias:** The strategy's initial action and its general inclination to cooperate when the group exhibits cooperative behavior clearly demonstrate this bias.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Cooperation is conditional on the actions of others, but it's a condition that aims to sustain a mutually beneficial outcome, not to exploit.
*   **Punishment as a Deterrent/Correction:** The defection phase is not about vindictiveness; it's a mechanism to discourage free-riding and to signal that cooperation is expected. The ability to return to cooperation once the group "corrects" its behavior underscores this.
*   **Adaptability for Long-Term Gains:** By adapting its thresholds, ACT tries to find a stable cooperative equilibrium that is sustainable given the group's behavior. It doesn't get stuck in a cycle of mutual defection if there's a chance for recovery.

*   **`decide_action(observed_actions_prev_round)`**: This is the core function called by the game engine in each round.
    *   It takes a list of all players' actions from the *previous* round as input.
    *   It then calculates the number of cooperators in the previous round.
    *   It checks for the special conditions: last round, or currently in a punishment phase.
    *   If not in a special condition, it calculates the `actual_cooperation_proportion` and then adjusts `cooperation_threshold` dynamically.
    *   Finally, it compares the `actual_cooperation_proportion` to the (potentially adjusted) `cooperation_threshold` to decide whether to cooperate or defect.
    *   If it decides to defect (and is not in the last round), it sets `punishment_rounds_remaining`.
*   **`count_cooperators(actions_list)`**: A simple helper function to count the 'C' actions in a list.

This ACT strategy provides a robust framework for navigating the N-Player Public Goods Game, balancing the desire for collective gain with the need for self-protection against exploitation.

description_COOPERATIVE_30 = '''
This strategy is designed to foster cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by employing a Tit-for-Tat-like approach, adapted for the group setting and incorporating a degree of forgiveness and vigilance. It aims to incentivize cooperation while protecting against exploitation, especially in the crucial final rounds.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocity with Conditional Forgiveness"

**Core Principle:** Start by cooperating, then reciprocate the previous round's average behavior of the group, with a tendency to forgive occasional defections, but to punish sustained defection.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to cooperate or defect in round `t` (where `t > 1`) is based on the group's behavior in the *previous* round (`t-1`).

*   **If the average cooperation rate in round `t-1` was high enough:** Player `i` will cooperate in round `t`.
*   **If the average cooperation rate in round `t-1` was low:** Player `i` will defect in round `t`.

To define "high enough" and "low," we introduce a **cooperation threshold**. This threshold is dynamically adjusted based on past group behavior to encourage convergence towards higher cooperation.

Let:
*   `C_t` be the number of cooperators in round `t`.
*   `avg_coop_rate_{t-1} = C_{t-1} / n` be the average cooperation rate in round `t-1`.
*   `coop_threshold_t` be the cooperation threshold for round `t`.

**Decision Rule for Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

*   **If `avg_coop_rate_{t-1}` >= `coop_threshold_t`:** Player `i` plays **C**.
*   **If `avg_coop_rate_{t-1}` < `coop_threshold_t`:** Player `i` plays **D**.

**Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

The `coop_threshold_t` will be adjusted to guide the group towards higher cooperation. A simple approach is to slightly lower the threshold when cooperation is successful, and raise it when it falters.

*   **If `avg_coop_rate_{t-1}` >= `coop_threshold_t` (i.e., we cooperated and the group largely did too):**
    `coop_threshold_t = max(k/n, coop_threshold_{t-1} - forgiveness_factor)`
    The `max(k/n, ...)` ensures the threshold doesn't go below the Nash Equilibrium defection point where `k/n` is the critical value for individual incentive to cooperate. `forgiveness_factor` is a small positive value.
*   **If `avg_coop_rate_{t-1}` < `coop_threshold_t` (i.e., we cooperated but the group largely defected, or we defected and the group defected):**
    `coop_threshold_t = min(1.0, coop_threshold_{t-1} + punishment_factor)`
    The `min(1.0, ...)` caps the threshold. `punishment_factor` is a small positive value, generally larger than `forgiveness_factor` to signal that sustained defection is not tolerated.

**A more nuanced approach to the threshold:**

Instead of a fixed threshold, let's consider a smoothed average of past cooperation rates. This makes the strategy less susceptible to a single bad round.

Let `smoothed_avg_coop_{t-1}` be a weighted average of cooperation rates from previous rounds.

*   `smoothed_avg_coop_t = α * avg_coop_rate_t + (1 - α) * smoothed_avg_coop_{t-1}`
    where `α` (alpha) is a smoothing factor (e.g., 0.1).

**Revised Decision Rule for Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

*   **If `smoothed_avg_coop_{t-1}` >= `coop_threshold_t`:** Player `i` plays **C**.
*   **If `smoothed_avg_coop_{t-1}` < `coop_threshold_t`:** Player `i` plays **D**.

**Revised Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **If `smoothed_avg_coop_{t-1}` >= `coop_threshold_t`:**
    `coop_threshold_t = max(k/n, coop_threshold_{t-1} - forgiveness_factor)`
*   **If `smoothed_avg_coop_{t-1}` < `coop_threshold_t`:**
    `coop_threshold_t = min(1.0, coop_threshold_{t-1} + punishment_factor)`

**Key Parameters to Tune:**
*   `forgiveness_factor`: How much we "lower our guard" after successful cooperation.
*   `punishment_factor`: How much we "raise our guard" after sustained defection.
*   `α` (alpha): The smoothing factor for the group's average cooperation.

A good starting point could be: `forgiveness_factor = 0.05`, `punishment_factor = 0.1`, `α = 0.1`.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (`t=1`):**
    Since there is no history, the strategy must make an initial decision.
    **Decision Rule:** Play **C**.
    Rationale: To initiate cooperation and signal a cooperative intent. This is the most cooperative starting move.

*   **Last Round (`t=r`):**
    In the last round, there's no future to incentivize. This often leads to a "folk theorem" breakdown, where the rational choice is to defect. To mitigate this, we can make the strategy more resilient to defection as the end approaches. However, the prompt states the strategy *only* depends on parameters and history, not a predefined last round action.

    **Standard Approach (no special last round rule beyond history):**
    The strategy will follow its regular decision rule based on the second-to-last round's history. If the group has been cooperative, it will cooperate. If not, it will defect. This implicitly handles the last round.

    **Alternative (if we can infer 'last round' from the count):**
    If we know `r` beforehand and can trigger a specific behavior in round `r`, then:
    **Decision Rule for Round `r`:**
    *   If `avg_coop_rate_{r-1}` >= `coop_threshold_r`: Play **C**.
    *   If `avg_coop_rate_{r-1}` < `coop_threshold_r`: Play **D**.

    However, to strictly adhere to "only depends on game parameters and history," we will *not* implement a special "last round" action beyond the general mechanism. The adaptive nature of the threshold should naturally lead to more cautious behavior as rounds progress if defection is prevalent.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative for several reasons:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It always starts by cooperating, offering the benefit of the doubt and initiating a potentially beneficial collective outcome.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation with cooperation. If the group reciprocates cooperation, this strategy continues to cooperate, reinforcing the cooperative norm.
*   **Forgiveness:** The `forgiveness_factor` allows for minor deviations from full cooperation without immediately triggering a defection. This acknowledges that mistakes or occasional self-interest can happen, and doesn't punish them too harshly, giving cooperation a chance to recover.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The dynamic adjustment of the `coop_threshold` actively works to encourage higher levels of cooperation. By lowering the threshold when cooperation is observed, it makes it easier for the group to maintain cooperative behavior.
*   **Robustness:** The use of a smoothed average cooperation rate (`smoothed_avg_coop`) and a dynamic threshold makes the strategy robust. It's not easily derailed by a single defector or a single round of bad luck. It requires a sustained pattern of behavior to influence its decisions.

This strategy provides a solid foundation for cooperative play in the N-Player Public Goods Game. Its adaptability and a balance of incentivizing cooperation while protecting against exploitation make it a strong contender in competitive environments.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_31 = '''
Here's a design for a cooperative strategy in the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability, robustness, and a cooperative mindset, while adhering to the game's constraints.

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness (ARF)

**Core Philosophy:** ARF aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a built-in mechanism for forgiveness to prevent cycles of mutual defection. It learns from the collective behavior of the group and adapts its response accordingly.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect in ARF is based on a dynamic threshold that reflects the current level of cooperation in the group and the player's own past experiences.

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   The proportion of cooperators in the previous round ($P_{cooperators, t-1}$) is *above* a dynamically adjusted cooperation threshold ($T_C$).
    *   OR, if the player has defected in the previous round, but the proportion of cooperators in the previous round ($P_{cooperators, t-1}$) has sufficiently recovered to indicate a return to cooperative norms.

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   The proportion of cooperators in the previous round ($P_{cooperators, t-1}$) is *below* the dynamically adjusted cooperation threshold ($T_C$).
    *   OR, if the player has defected in the previous round, and the proportion of cooperators has *not* sufficiently recovered.

**Dynamic Cooperation Threshold ($T_C$)**:

The cooperation threshold is not fixed. It adjusts based on the collective behavior observed:

*   $T_C$ starts at a moderate level (e.g., 50% of players).
*   If the group consistently cooperates (proportion of cooperators is high and sustained), $T_C$ might slightly decrease to encourage even more cooperation, making it easier to trigger a cooperative move.
*   If the group consistently defects (proportion of cooperators is low and sustained), $T_C$ might slightly increase, making it harder to defect and encouraging a return to cooperation.
*   A key element is **forgiveness**: If the player *defected* in the previous round, they will only return to cooperation if the group's cooperation level significantly improves from its defection state. This prevents immediate retaliation and allows for recovery.

**Forgiveness Mechanism**:

The ARF strategy incorporates a "forgiveness counter" or a "recovery threshold."

*   If ARF defects, it enters a "punishment" state.
*   To exit the punishment state and cooperate again, the proportion of cooperators in the group must not only be above the current threshold ($T_C$), but also show a *significant positive trend* or reach a *higher recovery threshold* than the current $T_C$. This ensures that a single round of slightly improved cooperation isn't enough to overcome a history of defection by ARF itself.

**Initial Cooperation Tendency:**

To be clearly cooperative, ARF will *initially favor cooperation*. This means in the early rounds, before significant history is accumulated, the strategy leans towards playing 'C'.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**First Round (t=1):**

*   **Decision:** Always Cooperate (C).
*   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative and forward-looking strategy is to initiate cooperation. This sets a positive example and allows the ARF to begin gathering data for its adaptive mechanism.

**Last Round (t=r):**

*   **Decision:** Always Defect (D).
*   **Rationale:** This is a standard approach in repeated games. Since there are no future rounds to reciprocate or punish, the incentive to cooperate for future gains disappears. Defecting in the last round maximizes the player's immediate payoff, assuming other players might still cooperate. This is a pragmatic adaptation for the final interaction.

**Other Rounds (1 < t < r):**

*   The decision rules described in Section 1 are applied. The dynamic threshold and forgiveness mechanism are actively used.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative

ARF embodies a cooperative mindset through several mechanisms:

*   **Initial Generosity:** It starts by cooperating, demonstrating a willingness to build a cooperative environment.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation by continuing to cooperate when others do.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** The dynamic threshold is designed to encourage cooperation. It's more forgiving in leaning towards cooperation than purely tit-for-tat-like strategies in larger groups. The goal is to create a stable cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Forgiveness:** The forgiveness mechanism is crucial. It prevents ARF from getting locked into cycles of mutual defection. It acknowledges that mistakes or opportunistic defections can happen, and provides a pathway back to cooperation if the group demonstrates a sustained commitment to it. This is a more robust form of cooperation than immediate, unforgiving punishment.
*   **Focus on Collective Benefit:** While aiming for a good individual payoff, ARF's adaptive nature implicitly seeks to find and maintain a state where the *total* payoff for the group is maximized, which occurs when cooperation is high.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```
strategy ARF(parameters, history):
    n = parameters.n
    r = parameters.r
    k = parameters.k

    // Initialize strategy parameters
    if history is empty: // First round (t=1)
        return C

    // Extract relevant information from history
    last_round_actions = history.last_round_actions // List of actions of all players in the last round
    num_cooperators_last_round = count_cooperators(last_round_actions)
    proportion_cooperators_last_round = num_cooperators_last_round / n
    my_last_action = history.my_last_action

    // Dynamic Threshold Management (simplified example)
    // In a real implementation, this would be more complex, possibly learning over time.
    // For this description, we'll use a baseline and adapt it slightly.
    baseline_cooperation_threshold = 0.5 // Start at 50%

    // Adapt threshold based on sustained behavior (example)
    if proportion_cooperators_last_round > 0.8 and history.average_cooperation_rate_over_last_5_rounds > 0.7:
        cooperation_threshold = max(0.3, baseline_cooperation_threshold - 0.05) // Slightly easier to cooperate
    elif proportion_cooperators_last_round < 0.2 and history.average_cooperation_rate_over_last_5_rounds < 0.3:
        cooperation_threshold = min(0.7, baseline_cooperation_threshold + 0.05) // Slightly harder to cooperate
    else:
        cooperation_threshold = baseline_cooperation_threshold

    // Forgiveness Mechanism - Simplified recovery threshold
    recovery_threshold = cooperation_threshold + 0.1 // Need a significant improvement to return to cooperation after defecting

    // Decision Logic
    if current_round == r: // Last round
        return D

    if my_last_action == C:
        // If I cooperated last round, I cooperate if current cooperation is above threshold
        if proportion_cooperators_last_round >= cooperation_threshold:
            return C
        else:
            // If cooperation has dropped, I defect
            return D
    else: // My last action was D
        // If I defected last round, I require a strong recovery to cooperate again
        if proportion_cooperators_last_round >= recovery_threshold:
            return C
        else:
            // Otherwise, I continue to defect
            return D

// Helper function (conceptual)
function count_cooperators(actions_list):
    count = 0
    for action in actions_list:
        if action == C:
            count = count + 1
    return count
```

---

**Robustness Considerations:**

*   **Against Pure Defectors:** ARF will eventually learn to defect if the environment is overwhelmingly defection-oriented. It won't be exploited indefinitely.
*   **Against Random Strategies:** ARF's adaptive nature allows it to filter out noise. A few random defections won't immediately trigger a defection response if the overall trend is cooperative.
*   **Against More Complex Strategies:** By observing group dynamics, ARF can indirectly adapt. If a strategy is systematically trying to exploit others, ARF will observe the resulting lower cooperation levels and adjust its threshold and forgiveness accordingly. The key is that ARF's decision is based on the *aggregate* outcome, not on identifying and perfectly countering every other player's strategy.

This strategy aims to balance the desire for high payoffs through cooperation with the necessity of protecting itself from exploitation, making it a robust and cooperatively-minded contender.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_32 = '''
This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding collective effort and punishing defection, while being mindful of the limited scope of the game and the need to secure a baseline payoff. It's designed to be adaptive and robust to varying opponent behaviors in a repeated game setting.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Reward and Punishment"

This strategy is fundamentally **tit-for-tat inspired, but adapted for a public goods context.** It seeks to establish a cooperative equilibrium by signaling a willingness to cooperate as long as others do, and to retaliate against defection. The key is to make cooperation more attractive than defection when others are cooperating, and to make defection costly for defectors.

### 1. Decision Rules

My decision in any given round is based on the **observed average cooperation rate of the previous round.**

*   **If the average cooperation rate in the previous round was above a certain threshold, I will Cooperate (C).**
*   **Otherwise (if the average cooperation rate was at or below the threshold), I will Defect (D).**

**Threshold Determination:**

The threshold is crucial for balancing cooperation and self-interest. A reasonable threshold would be set slightly above the minimum required to maintain a positive payoff from cooperation.

Let's analyze the payoff:
*   If I cooperate, my payoff is `(k/n) * total_contributions`.
*   If I defect, my payoff is `1 + (k/n) * (total_contributions - 1)`.

For cooperation to be individually beneficial when others cooperate, we need:
`(k/n) * total_contributions > 1 + (k/n) * (total_contributions - 1)`
`(k/n) * total_contributions > 1 + (k/n) * total_contributions - k/n`
`0 > 1 - k/n`
`k/n > 1`

However, the game specification states `1 < k < n`, so `k/n > 1` is not always true. This means **cooperating is only individually rational if the number of cooperators is sufficiently high such that my share of the public good outweighs my endowment loss AND the benefit to others from my cooperation.**

The total payoff from the group playing C is `n * 2`. The total payoff from the group playing D is `n * 1`. The total payoff from the group is `n`.
If `k/n` is close to 1, then the benefit of collective cooperation is high.

Given `1 < k < n`, `k/n` is between 0 and 1.
*   If all cooperate, payoff is `0 + (k/n) * n = k`. Since `k > 1`, this is better than defecting and getting 1.
*   If all defect, payoff is `1 + (k/n) * 0 = 1`.
*   If player i defects and others cooperate (n-1 cooperators), player i gets `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. Player i cooperates, they get `0 + (k/n) * n`.

The critical point is when the payoff from cooperating is equal to the payoff from defecting, given a certain number of cooperators.
` (1 - c_i) + (k/n) * total_contributions_if_I_cooperate ` vs ` (1 - c_i) + (k/n) * total_contributions_if_I_defect `

Let's consider the payoff for player `i` when `X` players (excluding `i`) cooperate.
*   If `i` cooperates: `π_i = 0 + (k/n) * (X + 1)`
*   If `i` defects: `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * X`

Player `i` prefers to cooperate if:
`(k/n) * (X + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * X`
`(k/n) * X + k/n > 1 + (k/n) * X`
`k/n > 1`

This inequality `k/n > 1` is *not* true given the game parameters. This means that **individually, defecting is always the dominant strategy if the game were a one-shot game.** The repeated nature and the cooperative strategy's goal is to overcome this.

Therefore, our threshold needs to be set to encourage cooperation, even if it's not immediately individually optimal in a single instance. It's about creating a future benefit for cooperation.

**Proposed Threshold:** A threshold of **> 50% cooperation** (i.e., more than half the players cooperated in the previous round) seems like a reasonable starting point. This signifies a general willingness to cooperate within the group. If this threshold is met, I will reciprocate by cooperating. If it's not met, it suggests a general tendency towards defection, and I will protect my endowment.

**Rationale for the threshold:** This threshold aims to capture situations where cooperation is "almost" beneficial to everyone, or where a slight majority are cooperating, indicating potential for coordination.

**Pseudocode for Decision Rule:**

```
function decide_action(player_id, game_history, game_parameters):
  n = game_parameters['n']
  r = game_parameters['r']
  k = game_parameters['k']

  if current_round == 1:
    # Handle first round separately (see edge cases)
    return COOPERATE

  previous_round_actions = game_history[current_round - 1] # List of actions (C or D) for all players in previous round
  num_cooperators_previous_round = count_cooperators(previous_round_actions)
  average_cooperation_rate_previous_round = num_cooperators_previous_round / n

  # Define the cooperation threshold
  cooperation_threshold = 0.5

  if average_cooperation_rate_previous_round > cooperation_threshold:
    return COOPERATE
  else:
    return DEFECT

function count_cooperators(actions_list):
  count = 0
  for action in actions_list:
    if action == COOPERATE:
      count += 1
  return count
```

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** In the absence of any history, to signal cooperative intent and establish a baseline for the game, I will **Cooperate (C)** in the first round. This is a gamble on the potential for cooperation and sets a precedent for reciprocation. If others also cooperate, it immediately establishes a positive equilibrium.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the final round, the incentive to maintain cooperation for future rounds disappears. This is a classic problem in repeated games, leading to a backward induction towards defection. To mitigate this, my strategy will **continue to apply the general decision rule (based on the threshold of the second-to-last round's cooperation rate).** While this might lead to suboptimal outcomes in the very last round if the previous round was cooperative, it encourages cooperation throughout the preceding rounds and avoids a sudden collapse of cooperation. The goal is to maximize the *total* payoff, not just the last round's.

*   **All Players Defecting:** If the historical average cooperation rate consistently falls below the threshold, the strategy will default to **Defect (D)**. This is a protective mechanism to ensure a baseline payoff of 1 in rounds where cooperation is not being reciprocated.

*   **All Players Cooperating:** If the historical average cooperation rate remains above the threshold, the strategy will continue to **Cooperate (C)**, aiming to sustain the mutually beneficial outcome where each player receives a payoff of `k` (which is greater than 1).

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is inherently cooperative in its design:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It starts by offering cooperation in the first round, demonstrating a willingness to engage in the public good.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards observed cooperation with further cooperation. This is the core of the "conditional reward" aspect. If a majority of players are contributing to the common good, this strategy believes it is beneficial to also contribute.
*   **Deterrence of Defection:** While not purely punitive, the strategy punishes persistent defection by also defecting. This is not vindictive; it's a rational response to a situation where cooperation is not being reciprocated, and thus the individual payoff from defecting becomes more appealing. The "punishment" is simply withdrawing cooperation when it's no longer mutually beneficial.
*   **Stability:** By aiming to maintain a cooperative equilibrium through conditional reciprocation, it seeks to achieve higher total payoffs for all players over the course of the game compared to a strategy that solely focuses on immediate individual gain.

**Overall Philosophy:** This strategy operates on the principle that cooperation can be a stable and beneficial outcome in a repeated interaction, provided there's a mechanism for encouraging it and discouraging exploitation. It prioritizes establishing and maintaining cooperative norms through observed behavior rather than relying on predetermined schedules or external coordination.

description_COOPERATIVE_33 = '''
Here's a design for a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness.

## Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Collective Punishment (TF-CP)

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by initially cooperating, but also introduces a mechanism to deter free-riding and punish consistent defection. It adapts based on the collective behavior of the group.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to signal a willingness to build a cooperative equilibrium.
2.  **Reciprocity:** Reward cooperation with cooperation, and punish defection with defection.
3.  **Collective Focus:** Adapt decisions based on the *overall* level of cooperation in the group, not just the actions of a single player.
4.  **Forgiveness (Conditional):** If the group returns to a high level of cooperation, the strategy is willing to forgive past defections.
5.  **Patience:** Understanding that building cooperation takes time and may involve setbacks.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) for player `i` in round `t` depends on two main factors: the overall cooperation rate in the *previous* round and whether the game is nearing its end.

*   **Baseline Decision:**
    *   If the **average cooperation rate** in the previous round (`t-1`) was **greater than or equal to the threshold `θ`**, then player `i` plays **C**.
    *   If the **average cooperation rate** in the previous round (`t-1`) was **less than the threshold `θ`**, then player `i` plays **D**.

*   **Threshold `θ`:** This threshold is crucial. A good starting point would be slightly above the "rational" defection point if everyone else cooperated. Given that if everyone cooperates, payoff is `k`, and if one defects, their payoff is `1`, while others get `(k/n) * (n-1)`. The individual incentive to defect arises when `1 > (k/n) * (n-1)`.

    Let's define `θ` in relation to the payoff structure. A reasonable threshold for collective cooperation would be a level where the group benefits overall. If `C_total` is the total number of cooperators, the total payoff is `C_total * (k/n) * n = C_total * k`. The total private payoff is `(n - C_total) * 1`. The sum of payoffs is `C_total * k + (n - C_total)`. This is maximized when `C_total = n` (yielding `n * k`) and minimized when `C_total = 0` (yielding `n`). Since `k > 1`, full cooperation is socially optimal.

    A good threshold `θ` could be set such that if the average cooperation rate is *below* this, the group is not benefiting as much as it could, and a period of defection is warranted to punish free-riders and encourage a return to higher cooperation.

    **Proposed `θ`:** `θ = (k/n)`. This means if the average number of cooperators divided by `n` falls below `k/n`, we defect. This is a dynamic threshold that reacts to the multiplication factor `k`.

*   **Endgame Punishment:**
    *   In the **last round (`r`)**, player `i` will always play **D**. This is a standard result in repeated games; without future cooperation to incentivize, the last round becomes a one-shot game where defection is the dominant strategy.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t=1`):**
    *   Since there is no history, the strategy defaults to **Cooperate (C)**. This is the initial signal of good faith and the desire to build cooperation.

*   **Last Round (`t=r`):**
    *   As mentioned above, player `i` will always play **Defect (D)** in the final round. This strategy explicitly accounts for the incentive to defect in the last round.

*   **Rounds `t = r-1` to `r` (Near Endgame):**
    *   To manage the transition to the last round, we can introduce a "grace period" of gradual defection.
    *   **Round `r-1`:** Play **C** if the previous round's average cooperation rate was `>= θ`. Otherwise, play **D**. (No special rule here, it follows the baseline).
    *   **Round `r`:** Always play **D**.

    *Self-correction on Endgame:* While always defecting in the last round is theoretically sound, it can be exploitative. An alternative, more cooperative-leaning endgame could be to defect in the last round *only if* the previous round's average cooperation rate was below `θ`. This softens the endgame punishment. However, for a tournament setting where robustness against exploitative strategies is key, the "always defect" in the last round is often more resilient. Let's stick with the strong endgame: **Always defect in round `r`**.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is designed to be cooperative in spirit by:

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** It starts with a cooperative move, hoping to set a positive tone.
*   **Rewarding Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the group demonstrates a sufficient level of cooperation. This rewards the collective effort.
*   **Adaptive Punishment:** Defection is not malicious; it's a response to perceived free-riding. The punishment is aimed at restoring a mutually beneficial cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Conditional Forgiveness:** If the group returns to high levels of cooperation, the strategy will re-engage in cooperation, showing a willingness to move past periods of defection. This is crucial for recovering from accidental or strategic downturns.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode

  total_cooperators_prev_round = count_of_C_in(previous_round_actions)
  average_cooperation_rate_prev_round = total_cooperators_prev_round / n

  # Define the cooperation threshold
  # A reasonable starting point is k/n, dynamically adjusting to the game's parameters.
  # If k/n is very low, even a few cooperators might keep the rate above threshold.
  # If k/n is high, it demands more collective effort.
  theta = k / n

  # Decision Rule

    return C  # Cooperate if collective cooperation is high enough
  else:

```

### Robustness and Adaptability Analysis:

*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Against Always-Defect:** If an opponent always defects, this strategy will eventually defect as the average cooperation rate drops. It won't be exploited indefinitely.
    *   **Against Random:** Random strategies will contribute to fluctuations in the cooperation rate, and this strategy will adapt accordingly. If random behavior causes the average to drop below `θ`, it will defect. If it fluctuates above, it will cooperate.
    *   **Against Tit-for-Tat:** In a group where most play Tit-for-Tat, this strategy will likely maintain cooperation, as the average cooperation rate will tend to stay high.
    *   **Against Complex Strategies:** It doesn't rely on predicting specific opponent moves but on the aggregate behavior, making it robust to diverse and complex strategies.

*   **Adaptability:**
    *   The `theta = k/n` threshold makes the strategy adaptive to different game parameters (`k` and `n`). A higher `k` or lower `n` means cooperation is more beneficial, and the threshold might dynamically allow for more cooperation.
    *   The feedback loop from the previous round's average cooperation rate allows it to adapt to the current group dynamic. If cooperation is thriving, it continues. If it's failing, it reacts.

This strategy provides a balanced approach, promoting cooperation while having a built-in defense against exploitation and a clear rule for the inevitable endgame.

description_COOPERATIVE_34 = '''
Here's a strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, aiming for cooperation while being adaptive and robust. This strategy is based on the **"Grim Trigger with Tit-for-Tat Adjustment"** principle, adapted for a public goods context.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Generous Grim Trigger"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a degree of leniency to prevent complete collapse of cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core idea is to **cooperate by default** and only defect when there is a clear indication that the collective benefit of cooperation is not being realized, or when being defected upon.

*   **Initial State (First Round):** Always cooperate (C). The assumption is that starting with cooperation sets a positive tone.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Cooperate (C) if:**
        *   The proportion of cooperators in the *previous round* was greater than a predefined threshold. This threshold signifies a minimum level of collective participation required to sustain cooperation.
        *   OR, if the player defected in the previous round but the *overall proportion of cooperators across all previous rounds* is still high enough, suggesting the defection might have been an anomaly or a response to a temporary dip.

    *   **Defect (D) if:**
        *   The player's own payoff in the *previous round* was significantly lower than what they would have received if everyone else had cooperated. This indicates that their cooperation was exploited.
        *   OR, if the proportion of cooperators in the *previous round* fell below the predefined threshold and has remained below it for a certain number of consecutive rounds. This signals a sustained decline in collective cooperation.
        *   OR, if the player received a significantly lower payoff than the average payoff in the previous round, and this disparity is not explained by a general low number of cooperators. This suggests the player might be a target of exploitation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t = 1):** **Cooperate (C)**. This is the foundational move to establish a cooperative norm.

*   **Last Round (t = r):** In the last round, the future incentive for cooperation disappears. Therefore, the strategy shifts to a **purely self-interested defection (D)**. This is a standard adaptation for finite repeated games where the end is known. The rationale is that any cooperation in the last round cannot be reciprocated in future rounds and only serves to benefit others without future returns.

*   **Sustained Low Cooperation:** If the proportion of cooperators consistently falls below the predefined threshold for a specified number of consecutive rounds, the strategy defaults to **defecting (D)**. This prevents prolonged exploitation without any prospect of recovery.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The strategy is inherently cooperative through its default action and its monitoring of collective success.

*   **Default to Cooperation:** The strategy starts by cooperating and continues to do so as long as the collective endeavor shows promise.
*   **Generous Trigger:** Instead of an immediate "grim trigger" (defect forever after one defection), this strategy uses a **punishment phase that is conditional and potentially temporary**. It monitors the overall trend of cooperation. If cooperation rebounds, it's willing to return to cooperating.
*   **Threshold for Cooperation:** The strategy doesn't require *everyone* to cooperate for it to cooperate. It sets a realistic threshold, acknowledging that perfect cooperation might be unattainable in practice. This makes it more robust to individual mistakes or occasional defections.
*   **Punishment is Proportional:** The decision to defect is triggered by sustained exploitation or a significant deviation from expected cooperative payoffs, not by a single instance of defection.

This is an excellent setup for exploring cooperative strategies in a repeated public goods game. The core challenge is to incentivize cooperation in the face of individual incentives to defect, especially when the multiplication factor $k$ is less than $n$. My designed strategy aims to achieve this by being conditionally cooperative and adaptive.

## Cooperative Strategy: Grim Trigger with Forgiveness (GTF)

The Grim Trigger with Forgiveness (GTF) strategy is designed to encourage sustained cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a mechanism to recover from periods of low cooperation. It leverages the repeated nature of the game to establish a norm of cooperation.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to establish a baseline and signal a desire for mutual gain.
2.  **Conditional Cooperation:** Reward continued cooperation. If others cooperate, continue to cooperate.
3.  **Punishment for Defection:** If any player defects, drastically reduce cooperation to signal disapproval and deter future defection.
4.  **Forgiveness:** After a period of punishment, if collective behavior improves, offer a chance to return to cooperation, preventing indefinite punishment that can be detrimental to overall payoff.

### 1. Decision Rules:

My strategy's decision for player $i$ in round $t$, denoted $a_{i,t}$, depends on the observed behavior of *all* players in the previous round $t-1$.

*   **Phase 1: Initial Cooperation (Rounds 1 to $R_{initial}$)**
    *   **Rule:** In the first $R_{initial}$ rounds, always play **C**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is to signal a cooperative intent and establish a high baseline of contributions. It allows players to observe each other's initial tendencies and establish a cooperative rhythm. $R_{initial}$ is a parameter we will define.

*   **Phase 2: Grim Trigger (Rounds $R_{initial}+1$ to $R_{trigger\_end}$)**
    *   **Condition:** If, in the previous round ($t-1$), *any* player $j$ defected ($a_{j, t-1} = D$), then the strategy enters a "punishment" state.
    *   **Decision Rule in Punishment State:** Always play **D**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the "grim" part of the strategy. A single defection triggers a strong, sustained punishment phase. This makes defection very costly for the entire group.
    *   **Exit from Punishment State:** The punishment phase continues until a certain condition is met. This condition is that for a consecutive number of rounds ($N_{forgiveness\_rounds}$), *all* players (including ourselves) have defected.
    *   **Rationale for Exit Condition:** We only consider returning to cooperation after a period where defection has been consistently punished by everyone. This ensures that the punishment phase has had a significant impact and that there is a demonstrated history of low cooperation.

*   **Phase 3: Forgiveness and Return to Cooperation (Rounds $R_{trigger\_end}+1$ to $r$)**
    *   **Condition:** If the punishment phase has ended (i.e., $N_{forgiveness\_rounds}$ consecutive rounds of all players defecting have occurred), the strategy enters the forgiveness phase.
    *   **Decision Rule in Forgiveness Phase:** Play **C**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the "forgiveness" part. After a significant period of punishment, the strategy attempts to re-establish cooperation. This allows the group to recover from a cycle of defection.
    *   **Transition back to Punishment:** If, at any point during the forgiveness phase, any player defects, the strategy immediately returns to the punishment state (Phase 2).

### Parameter Definitions:

*   $R_{initial}$: The number of initial rounds to cooperate unconditionally. A good starting point could be 5 rounds or 10% of $r$.
*   $N_{forgiveness\_rounds}$: The number of consecutive rounds where *all* players must defect for the strategy to consider returning to cooperation. A good starting point could be 5 rounds or 10% of $r$.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round ($t=1$):** Always play **C**. This is covered by Phase 1.
*   **Last Round ($t=r$):** The strategy does not explicitly change behavior in the last round. However, because it's the last round, there's no future to punish or reward.
    *   If the strategy is in the initial cooperation phase, it will play C.
    *   If the strategy is in the punishment phase, it will play D.
    *   If the strategy is in the forgiveness phase, it will play C.
    *   **Strategic Consideration for the Last Round:** While my strategy doesn't have a specific "last round" rule, the underlying logic of the game dynamics (where future punishment is no longer a deterrent) means that rational players *might* defect in the very last round, even if they've cooperated throughout. My strategy, by its deterministic nature, will continue its current phase. This is a known weakness of trigger strategies, but the long-term stability it encourages in earlier rounds often outweighs this.
*   **No Communication:** The strategy explicitly relies on observing past actions, which is allowed by the rules. It does not attempt any form of communication.
*   **No Coordination:** The strategy does not assume any pre-determined cooperation schedules. It reacts to observed history.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The entire design is geared towards achieving the highest *total* payoff for the group over the long run, which is the essence of cooperation in this game.

*   **Maximizing Joint Payoff:** When $k < n$, the highest *joint* payoff occurs when everyone cooperates. My strategy aims to achieve this state and maintain it for as long as possible.
*   **Deterrence:** The Grim Trigger mechanism serves as a strong deterrent against defection, safeguarding the cooperative state.
*   **Recovery:** The forgiveness phase ensures that the game doesn't get stuck in an infinitely punishing cycle if a temporary dip in cooperation occurs. This allows the group to "reset" and aim for cooperation again, which is crucial for long-term gains.
*   **Adaptive:** While not adapting its *parameters* based on opponent behavior (to keep it simple and robust), its *actions* are highly adaptive to the observed history of play. It's not a static strategy.

### Pseudocode:

```
// Parameters
R_initial = 5  // Number of initial rounds to cooperate
N_forgiveness_rounds = 5 // Consecutive all-D rounds needed to consider returning to C

// State variables
state = "INITIAL_COOPERATION" // "INITIAL_COOPERATION", "PUNISHMENT", "FORGIVENESS"
punishment_rounds_counter = 0 // Counts consecutive rounds where all players defected

function decide_action(round_t, my_history, all_players_history):
  // my_history: list of my actions {C, D}
  // all_players_history: list of lists, where each inner list is actions of all players in a round

  if round_t == 1:
    state = "INITIAL_COOPERATION"
    punishment_rounds_counter = 0
    return "C"

  // Get actions from the previous round
  previous_round_actions = all_players_history[round_t - 2] // round_t is 1-indexed, history is 0-indexed

  // --- State Transitions and Actions ---

  if state == "INITIAL_COOPERATION":
    // Check if anyone defected in the previous round
    anyone_defected = any(action == "D" for action in previous_round_actions)

    if anyone_defected:
      state = "PUNISHMENT"
      punishment_rounds_counter = 0 // Reset counter as we just entered punishment
      return "D"
    else:
      // If everyone cooperated, continue cooperating
      return "C"

  elif state == "PUNISHMENT":
    // Check if all players defected in the previous round
    all_defected_in_previous = all(action == "D" for action in previous_round_actions)

    if all_defected_in_previous:
      punishment_rounds_counter += 1
    else:
      punishment_rounds_counter = 0 // Reset if not all defected

    if punishment_rounds_counter >= N_forgiveness_rounds:
      state = "FORGIVENESS"
      // In the first round of forgiveness, we try to cooperate
      return "C"
    else:
      // Continue punishing
      return "D"

  elif state == "FORGIVENESS":
    // Check if anyone defected in the previous round
    anyone_defected = any(action == "D" for action in previous_round_actions)

    if anyone_defected:
      state = "PUNISHMENT"
      punishment_rounds_counter = 0 // Reset counter as we re-entered punishment
      return "D"
    else:
      // Continue forgiving and cooperating
      return "C"

  // Should not reach here
  return "D" // Default to defect if state is unknown
```

This strategy aims to be a strong contender by fostering a cooperative environment where possible, punishing deviations decisively, and having a mechanism for recovery to avoid being perpetually stuck in a low-payoff state.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_36 = '''
This N-Player Public Goods Game presents a classic dilemma: individual rationality (defecting) leads to a worse collective outcome than cooperation. The repeated nature of the game and perfect information open the door for strategies that can foster cooperation.

Here's a strategy designed to be cooperative, adaptive, and robust, focusing on a clear and principled approach:

## Strategy: The "Generous Forgiver" Strategy

This strategy aims to initiate and sustain cooperation by being forgiving of past defections, but also by clearly signaling that sustained defection will be met with a proportional response. The core idea is to try and get back to a cooperative state whenever possible, but to protect oneself from exploitation.

### 1. Decision Rules

The "Generous Forgiver" strategy's decision in any given round `t` (where `t > 1`) depends on the *proportion* of players who cooperated in the *previous* round `t-1`.

*   **If the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1` is greater than or equal to `k/n`:**
    *   **Play C (Cooperate).**
    *   **Rationale:** This is the "sweet spot" for public goods. If the average contribution (normalized) is at least `k/n`, then the total return from cooperation `(k/n) * total_contributions` is likely to be greater than or equal to the private cost of contributing `c_i = 1` for each cooperator. This threshold represents a point where the collective benefit of cooperation is at least partially realized, making it rational to continue investing in the public good.

*   **If the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1` is less than `k/n`:**
    *   **Play D (Defect).**
    *   **Rationale:** This indicates that the previous round's level of cooperation was insufficient to generate a strong collective return. To avoid being exploited and to incentivize a return to higher cooperation levels, defecting is the prudent choice. This is a punitive but not overly aggressive response; it signals that continued low cooperation will be met with defection.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Play C (Cooperate).**
    *   **Rationale:** The "Generous Forgiver" strategy is inherently cooperative. It initiates cooperation to demonstrate good faith and to see if others will reciprocate. This sets a positive baseline for the game.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   **Play D (Defect).**
    *   **Rationale:** This is the classic "end-game problem" in repeated games. With no future rounds, there's no incentive for future punishment or reward. Therefore, in the final round, individual rationality dictates defecting to maximize one's own payoff, as there are no repercussions for this choice in subsequent rounds.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The "Generous Forgiver" strategy is cooperative in its core logic:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** It always starts by cooperating, signaling a desire for mutual benefit.
*   **Forgiving Threshold:** It requires a *significant* drop in cooperation (below the `k/n` threshold) to trigger defection. This means it won't defect over minor dips in cooperation or the defection of a single player. It's willing to overlook some past "mistakes" if the overall level of cooperation is still reasonable.
*   **Adaptive:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the collective actions of the group, making it adaptable to a wide range of opponent behaviors.
*   **Proportional Response:** If cooperation fails to meet the minimum threshold, defection is a proportional response aimed at restoring a more beneficial state rather than a retaliatory or aggressive stance. It doesn't punish individual players, but rather the overall lack of collective effort.
*   **Robustness:** By setting a clear threshold (`k/n`) and a consistent decision rule, the strategy is robust. It doesn't rely on complex pattern recognition or assumptions about specific opponent strategies. It's a simple, repeatable rule that can be understood and potentially learned by other agents.

This cooperative strategy aims to maximize long-term group welfare while adapting to potential defections. It leans towards cooperation but incorporates mechanisms to retaliate against consistent exploitation and to forgive occasional lapses.

## Cooperative Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness and Parameter Awareness

This strategy is a variation of the well-known "Tit-for-Tat" strategy, adapted for the public goods game with the given parameters. It's designed to be:

*   **Nice:** It starts by cooperating.
*   **Retaliatory:** It punishes defections.
*   **Forgiving:** It doesn't hold grudges indefinitely.
*   **Adaptive:** It adjusts its behavior based on the observed cooperation levels and game parameters.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core decision rule is to mirror the *average* behavior of the other players from the previous round, but with a twist that encourages sustained cooperation.

*   **If the average contribution in the previous round was cooperative (i.e., greater than or equal to the "fair share" needed for mutual cooperation), then cooperate.**
*   **If the average contribution in the previous round was non-cooperative (i.e., less than the "fair share"), then defect.**

Let's define the "fair share" more formally. For everyone to be better off cooperating than defecting, the individual payoff from cooperating needs to be at least as good as the individual payoff from defecting.

*   **Payoff from cooperating:** `0 + (k/n) * total_cooperators`
*   **Payoff from defecting (if everyone else cooperates):** `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`

We are looking for a state where cooperating is individually rational. Consider the payoff for an individual *i* given the number of cooperators *C_t* in round *t*:

`π_i,t = (1 - c_i,t) + (k/n) * C_t`

Where `c_i,t = 1` if player *i* cooperates, and `0` if player *i* defects.

If all players cooperate (`C_t = n`), then `π_i,t = 0 + (k/n) * n = k`.
If all players defect (`C_t = 0`), then `π_i,t = 1 + (k/n) * 0 = 1`.

Since `1 < k < n`, when all cooperate, each player gets `k`. When all defect, each player gets `1`. This means cooperation is mutually beneficial when `k > 1`.

**The crucial insight is to determine when individual defection becomes tempting.** A player *i* will consider defecting if the payoff from defecting is greater than the payoff from cooperating, given the actions of others.

If player *i* defects while others cooperate: `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`
If player *i* cooperates while others cooperate: `π_i = 0 + (k/n) * n = k`

Player *i* is better off defecting if `1 + (k/n) * (n-1) > k`.
`1 + k - k/n > k`
`1 - k/n > 0`
`1 > k/n`
`n > k`

This condition `n > k` is given in the problem statement, meaning there's always an incentive to defect if everyone else cooperates. This is the classic social dilemma.

**Our cooperative strategy's decision rule will focus on the average cooperation level.**

Let `AvgCoop_t` be the fraction of players who cooperated in round `t`. `AvgCoop_t = C_t / n`.

*   **Decision for round `t+1`:**
    *   If `AvgCoop_t >= TargetCooperationLevel`, then play `C` in round `t+1`.
    *   If `AvgCoop_t < TargetCooperationLevel`, then play `D` in round `t+1`.

**What is `TargetCooperationLevel`?**

This level should reflect a point where sustained cooperation is at least *individually rational* on average, considering the cost of cooperation and the benefit derived from the group. A robust target is one that ensures that if this level of cooperation is met, the expected payoff from *cooperating* for a player is at least as good as the expected payoff from *defecting* over the long run.

A simple and effective `TargetCooperationLevel` would be related to the point where the marginal benefit of an additional cooperator to the group equals the cost to that cooperator. The marginal benefit to the group from one more cooperator is `k`. The cost to that cooperator is `1`. So, roughly, we want `k` to be greater than `1` for cooperation to be potentially sustainable.

Given that `1 < k < n`, the strategy will aim for a high level of cooperation. A reasonable `TargetCooperationLevel` would be a value slightly above what's needed to make cooperation *individually* rational for a majority, or even just to offset the temptation to defect.

**Let's define `TargetCooperationLevel` as `k/n`.**

*   If `AvgCoop_t >= k/n`: Cooperate in round `t+1`.
*   If `AvgCoop_t < k/n`: Defect in round `t+1`.

This threshold is key. If the average cooperation rate is above `k/n`, it means the collective benefit from cooperation is outperforming the individual cost on average. If it falls below `k/n`, it suggests that the group is not collectively benefiting enough from cooperation, and individual defection is more prevalent.

**Refinement: Introducing Forgiveness and Punishment Thresholds**

The simple `AvgCoop_t >= k/n` rule might be too sensitive to single rounds of defection. To make it more robust and forgiving:

1.  **Initial Cooperation:** Always cooperate in the first round.
2.  **Punishment Trigger:** If the number of defectors in the previous round *exceeds a certain threshold*, trigger a period of punishment (defection).
3.  **Forgiveness Mechanism:** After a period of punishment, if others return to cooperation, gradually forgive and return to cooperation.

**Revised Decision Rules:**

*   **In Round `t+1` (where `t > 0`):**
    *   **Count Defectors:** Let `D_t` be the number of players who defected in round `t`.
    *   **Calculate Average Cooperation:** `AvgCoop_t = (n - D_t) / n`.
    *   **Determine Strategy:**
        *   **If `AvgCoop_t >= k/n` OR `D_t < PunishmentThreshold`:** Play `C` in round `t+1`.
        *   **If `AvgCoop_t < k/n` AND `D_t >= PunishmentThreshold`:** Play `D` in round `t+1`.

**What is `PunishmentThreshold`?**

This is a parameter that controls how many defections are needed to trigger a retaliatory defection from our strategy. A value of `1` would make it pure Tit-for-Tat against the group's average. A higher value allows for more "slop" and forgiveness.

A good `PunishmentThreshold` could be a small fraction of `n`, or even a fixed small number like `2` or `3`. Let's consider `PunishmentThreshold = max(1, floor(n/4))`. This means if at least a quarter of players defect (or at least one player if `n` is small), we will consider retaliating.

**Further Refinement: Adaptive Punishment and Forgiveness**

Instead of a fixed `PunishmentThreshold`, we can make it adaptive.

*   **Adaptive `PunishmentThreshold`:** Start with a low threshold (e.g., 1 or 2). If a sustained period of defection occurs, gradually increase the threshold for retaliating. If cooperation returns, gradually decrease it.

This adds complexity. For a starting strategy, let's simplify and use the `AvgCoop_t >= k/n` rule, but with an added "punishment" mechanism that lasts for a fixed number of rounds.

**Simplified Cooperative Strategy: "Forgiving Tit-for-Tat on Average"**

1.  **Initial State:** Cooperate in the first round.
2.  **Observation:** At the end of each round `t`, observe the total number of cooperators `C_t`.
3.  **Decision Rule for Round `t+1`:**
    *   **If `C_t >= k` (i.e., average cooperation is at least `k/n`):** Play `C` in round `t+1`.
    *   **If `C_t < k`:** Play `D` in round `t+1`.

This strategy is simple and directly targets the group's collective behavior. If the group cooperates at a level where the collective benefit (`k * C_t`) is greater than or equal to the cost if everyone defected (`n * 1`), then we reciprocate. Otherwise, we defect.

**This strategy is essentially playing "Tit-for-Tat" against the *average behavior* of the group.**

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (r=1 or t=0):**
    *   **Decision:** Always play `C`.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the "nice" aspect of the strategy. It initiates cooperation and gives others a chance to reciprocate. It assumes that any initial defections are exploratory and not malicious.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Decision:** Always play `D`.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. The optimal strategy in a one-shot game, given the payoff structure where defection is always individually better when `k < n` and everyone else cooperates, is to defect. This strategy foresees this and acts accordingly to maximize its own payoff in the absolute final interaction.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative by:

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** It always starts with `C`, signaling a desire for mutual benefit.
*   **Reciprocating Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the majority of players are cooperating at a level that is collectively beneficial (`C_t >= k`).
*   **Responding to Non-Cooperation:** It defects when the group falls below this threshold, not out of spite, but as a rational response to a breakdown in collective action that makes defection more individually advantageous.
*   **Parameter-Awareness:** The threshold `k` is directly used. If `k` is high (closer to `n`), the strategy demands a higher level of cooperation, reflecting the greater potential benefit of group action. If `k` is low, it's more forgiving of lower cooperation rates.

### Pseudocode

```
Strategy_Cooperative_Public_Good(round_number, history, game_parameters):
  n = game_parameters['n']
  k = game_parameters['k']
  r = game_parameters['r']

  if round_number == 0:  # First round
    return 'C'

  if round_number == r - 1: # Last round (remember rounds are 0-indexed for r rounds)
    return 'D'

  # Observe previous round's cooperation
  if not history: # Should not happen after first round, but for safety
    return 'C' # Default to cooperate if no history

  previous_round_actions = history[-1] # Actions from the most recent completed round
  num_cooperators_previous_round = sum(1 for action in previous_round_actions if action == 'C')

  # Decision rule: Cooperate if previous round was sufficiently cooperative
  if num_cooperators_previous_round >= k:
    return 'C'
  else:
    return 'D'

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

*   `round_number`: The current round being played (0-indexed, so `0` to `r-1`).
*   `history`: A list of lists, where `history[t]` is a list of actions taken by all players in round `t`.
*   `game_parameters`: A dictionary containing `n`, `k`, and `r`.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and deterring free-riding when collective benefits are not being met. Its adaptive nature comes from responding directly to the group's observed behavior relative to the game's inherent incentives (`k`). The fixed decision for the last round is a necessary defensive measure in a repeated game with a known end.

## Cooperative Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Thresholding (TFT-AT)

This strategy aims to foster cooperation in a repeated public goods game by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, while also being adaptable to varying group dynamics. It leans into a cooperative mindset by initially signaling a willingness to contribute and only resorting to defection when necessary to protect individual payoffs, with a mechanism to return to cooperation if the group shifts.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of TFT-AT is a modified Tit-for-Tat approach. It observes the actions of other players in the previous round and adjusts its own behavior accordingly.

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, TFT-AT always chooses to **Cooperate (C)**. This signals a desire to build cooperation and explore mutually beneficial outcomes.
*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round (t-1) was *above* a certain adaptive threshold (T_coop),** then TFT-AT will **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round (t-1) was *at or below* the adaptive threshold (T_coop),** then TFT-AT will **Defect (D)**.

**Adaptive Threshold (T_coop):**

The adaptive threshold is crucial for robustness and avoids getting locked into perpetual defection. It is calculated as follows:

*   **T_coop = (k / n) * (n - 1)**

**Rationale for T_coop:**

*   **(k/n):** This is the individual benefit received from each unit contributed by any player.
*   **(n-1):** This represents the potential contribution from *all other* players.

This threshold essentially represents the minimum number of *other players* that need to cooperate for it to be individually rational (or at least not significantly detrimental) for our player to also cooperate. If fewer than this number of others cooperate, our player is better off defecting to secure their endowment.

**Why this threshold is adaptive:**

*   It directly incorporates the game parameters `k` and `n`. As `k` increases (making cooperation more rewarding), the threshold rises, encouraging more cooperation. As `n` increases, the threshold also rises (relative to the number of players), reflecting the Dilution Effect of contributions.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):** Always **Cooperate (C)**. This is a strong signal of cooperative intent.
*   **Last Round (t = r):** The strategy does *not* explicitly change its decision rule for the last round. The adaptive threshold mechanism inherently accounts for the game's finite nature. If cooperation has been successful throughout the game, it will continue to cooperate. If defection has been prevalent, it will continue to defect based on the threshold. This avoids the "end-game defection" problem that can arise in finitely repeated games where players might defect in the last round knowing there are no future repercussions. The focus remains on current round payoffs and the learning from previous rounds.
*   **Observing Zero Cooperators (t-1):** If in the previous round, zero players cooperated, our player will definitely defect in the current round, as the proportion of cooperators (0) will be below any reasonable threshold (especially since `k > 1` and `n >= 2` implies `T_coop > 0` when k/n > 0).
*   **Observing All Cooperators (t-1):** If all `n` players cooperated in the previous round, the proportion of cooperators will be 1. If `T_coop < 1`, our player will cooperate. If `T_coop >= 1` (which can happen if k/n is close to 1 and n is large), then our player will defect. This is a nuance to consider - even when everyone cooperates, if the benefit per cooperator is not sufficiently high, defection might become the individually rational choice for our AI. The adaptive threshold naturally handles this.

### 3. Cooperativeness Alignment

*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** The strategy begins with cooperation, demonstrating a proactive approach to achieving mutually beneficial outcomes.
*   **Reciprocity:** It mirrors the group's cooperative behavior. If the group is generally cooperative (above the threshold), it reciprocates with cooperation.
*   **Punishment for Non-Cooperation:** When the group's cooperation level falls below the adaptive threshold, it defects. This is not malicious but a rational response to protect its own endowment and to incentivize a return to cooperation. It signals that defection will be met with defection.
*   **Forgiveness/Re-initiation:** The adaptive threshold mechanism inherently allows for a return to cooperation. If a period of defection occurs, but then a sufficient number of players start cooperating again (pushing the proportion above the threshold), TFT-AT will resume cooperation. This prevents it from getting stuck in cycles of mutual defection.
*   **Parameter Dependence:** The strategy's behavior is entirely dictated by the game parameters (`n` and `k`) and the history of play, aligning with the requirement of not relying on external norms or communication.

### Pseudocode

```python
class TitForTatAdaptiveThreshold:
    def __init__(self, n, k, r):
        self.n = n
        self.k = k
        self.r = r

        self.opponent_history = [[] for _ in range(n)] # List of lists, each sublist for an opponent's actions
        self.round_count = 0
        self.adaptive_threshold = (self.k / self.n) * (self.n - 1) # Minimum number of OTHER cooperators needed

    def choose_action(self, round_number, opponent_actions_in_previous_round):

            num_cooperators_previous_round = sum(1 for action in opponent_actions_in_previous_round if action == 'C')

            # Calculate the proportion of cooperators (including self if self was C)
            # For decision rule, we only care about what OTHERS did.
            # The threshold is defined in terms of OTHER players.
            if num_cooperators_previous_round >= self.adaptive_threshold:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

    def update_history(self, my_action, opponent_actions):
        self.my_history.append(my_action)
        for i in range(self.n):
            if i < len(opponent_actions): # Ensure index is valid
                self.opponent_history[i].append(opponent_actions[i])

# Example Usage (Conceptual - this would be part of a simulation)
# strategy = TitForTatAdaptiveThreshold(n=6, k=2, r=10)
# for t in range(1, strategy.r + 1):
#     # In a real simulation, opponent_actions_prev_round would come from the simulator
#     # For round 1, it's empty or None
#     opponent_actions_prev_round = [] # This would be populated by the simulator based on t-1
#     action = strategy.choose_action(t, opponent_actions_prev_round)
#     # ... simulator plays out round t ...
#     # strategy.update_history(action, actions_of_opponents_in_round_t)
```

**Note on the pseudocode's `opponent_actions_in_previous_round`:** In a real tournament setting, this input to `choose_action` would be a list of actions taken by all other `n-1` players in the immediately preceding round. The strategy's `update_history` would then record these actions for future rounds. The `adaptive_threshold` is calculated based on the number of *other* players. If `num_cooperators_previous_round` (from others) is at least `self.adaptive_threshold`, then cooperate.

This TFT-AT strategy offers a balanced approach, prioritizing cooperation while remaining rational and adaptive in the face of diverse player behaviors.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_39 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptiveness and robustness:

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Trust Threshold

**Core Philosophy:** This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a built-in "trust threshold" to prevent immediate punishment and allow for recovery from accidental defections or early exploration. It prioritizes long-term cooperation while being resilient to exploitative behaviors.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate (C) or defect (D) in round `t` depends on the observed behavior of other players in the previous round (`t-1`) and the current state of "trust" the strategy holds towards the group.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Cooperator Count (N_C_t-1):** The number of players (excluding the current player) who played 'C' in round `t-1`.
*   **Defector Count (N_D_t-1):** The number of players (excluding the current player) who played 'D' in round `t-1`.
*   **Trust Level (T_t):** A dynamic measure of how much the strategy trusts the group to cooperate. It starts at a high value and decreases with observed defections.
*   **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** A parameter that determines the minimum proportion of cooperators required to maintain trust and encourage cooperation. This threshold is related to the game parameters.

**Decision Logic (for rounds t > 1):**

1.  **If Trust Level (T_t) is High (above a certain threshold):**
    *   **If the proportion of observed cooperators in round `t-1` (N_C_t-1 / (n-1)) is above the Cooperation Threshold (CT):**
        *   **Play C (Cooperate).** This indicates that the group is generally cooperating, and we should reciprocate.
    *   **Else (proportion of cooperators is below CT):**
        *   **Play D (Defect).** This is a signal that cooperation is breaking down. We defect to protect our endowment and potentially punish the defections.
        *   **Decrease Trust Level (T_t).**

2.  **If Trust Level (T_t) is Low (below or at the threshold):**
    *   **If the proportion of observed cooperators in round `t-1` (N_C_t-1 / (n-1)) is still low OR if we observed a significant number of defections in the previous round (e.g., N_D_t-1 > some critical number):**
        *   **Play D (Defect).** We remain in a defensive state, waiting for a clear signal of sustained cooperation.
        *   **Keep Trust Level low or decrease it further.**
    *   **Else (proportion of cooperators is above CT and there haven't been too many recent defections):**
        *   **Play C (Cooperate).** This represents an attempt to rebuild trust and re-enter a cooperative phase.
        *   **Increase Trust Level (T_t).**

**Determining the Cooperation Threshold (CT):**

The CT should be set based on the game parameters. A reasonable CT would be the minimum proportion of players needed to make cooperation individually beneficial *on average*, considering the possibility of some defections.

*   A player playing C gets `(k/n) * N_C` where `N_C` is the total number of cooperators.
*   A player playing D gets `1`.
*   For cooperation to be potentially beneficial for *all* players, the average payoff from cooperation must be at least as good as the average payoff from defection.

Consider the point where playing C yields at least as much as playing D. This happens when `(k/n) * N_C >= 1`. So, `N_C >= n/k`.
Since `k < n`, `n/k > 1`. This suggests that for cooperation to be truly mutually beneficial, more than `n/k` players need to cooperate.

A robust Cooperation Threshold (CT) could be slightly *higher* than `1/k` (as a proportion). Let's define:

*   **Target Cooperation Proportion:** `target_prop = 1.0 / k`
*   **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** Set `CT = target_prop * 1.1` (a 10% buffer) or `CT = max(0.5, target_prop * 1.1)` to ensure it doesn't fall too low for small `k`. A fixed value like `0.7` could also be a starting point and might be adjusted dynamically.

**Trust Level Dynamics:**

*   **Initial Trust:** Start with a high trust level, e.g., `T_1 = 1.0`.
*   **When Playing C:**
    *   If the group also played cooperatively (proportion of C >= CT), slightly increase trust: `T_t = min(1.0, T_{t-1} + 0.05)`.
    *   If the group defected (proportion of C < CT), significantly decrease trust: `T_t = max(0.0, T_{t-1} - 0.2)`.
*   **When Playing D:**
    *   If the group also defected, keep trust low: `T_t = max(0.0, T_{t-1} - 0.1)`.
    *   If the group unexpectedly cooperated, slightly increase trust: `T_t = min(1.0, T_{t-1} + 0.02)`.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** Play **C (Cooperate)**. This is the most cooperative starting move, aiming to initiate a cooperative norm.
    *   **Trust:** Initialize `Trust Level (T_1) = 1.0`.
    *   **Observation:** No history to observe, so this decision is purely proactive.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** Play **D (Defect)**. In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defecting. Therefore, the incentive is to maximize individual payoff in this last round. There's no benefit to signaling cooperation for future rounds. This is a standard endgame adjustment in repeated games.

*   **First Defection:**
    *   The "Trust Threshold" mechanism is designed to handle the *first* defection gracefully. Instead of immediately retaliating, the strategy will first assess if the defection was an anomaly or part of a trend. If the next round sees a return to cooperation, trust might increase, and the strategy might revert to cooperation. Only sustained defections will lead to prolonged defection.

*   **Consistent Defection from Others:**
    *   If the proportion of cooperators consistently falls below the CT, the Trust Level will drop significantly. The strategy will enter a phase of repeated defections, only returning to cooperation if a sustained period of high cooperation (above CT) is observed, signaling a genuine shift in the group's behavior.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is inherently cooperative in its design:

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating (Round 1) to establish a cooperative tone.
*   **Reciprocity:** It largely mirrors the observed behavior of the group, rewarding cooperation with cooperation.
*   **Forgiveness (with conditions):** The Trust Threshold allows for some "forgiveness" for isolated defections. It doesn't immediately punish, giving the group a chance to self-correct.
*   **End goal:** The aim is to create a stable state of high cooperation, which yields the highest *total* group payoff and individual payoffs in the long run, as demonstrated by the example calculations (all C yields 2, while all D yields 1).

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```

This strategy provides a balance between being a strong cooperator and a resilient player, adaptable to the varying behaviors it might encounter in the tournament.

description_COOPERATIVE_40 = '''
This strategy aims to foster cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by being forgiving and retaliatory, but with a focus on maintaining long-term cooperation. It's designed to be adaptive and robust, as it learns from the history of play and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Forgiving Tit-for-Tat with an Escalation Clause"

This strategy is inspired by the principles of Tit-for-Tat, but adapted for a public goods setting. It prioritizes cooperation but introduces a mechanism to punish persistent defection and reward sustained cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core decision rule is to **Cooperate (C)** in a given round unless the past behavior of the group as a whole warrants defection.

**Specific Decision Rule:**

*   **In Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**
    *   **Cooperate (C)** if the average contribution of *all* players in the previous round `t-1` was greater than or equal to a certain threshold.
    *   **Defect (D)** if the average contribution of *all* players in the previous round `t-1` was less than this threshold.

**The Threshold:**

The threshold is dynamic and reflects the desired level of cooperation. A good starting point and dynamic adjustment mechanism is based on the average number of cooperators observed in previous rounds, specifically aiming for a level of cooperation that, on average, leads to a positive individual payoff from cooperation.

Let `N_C(t-1)` be the total number of players who cooperated in round `t-1`.
Let `Avg_C(t-1) = N_C(t-1) / n` be the average proportion of cooperators in round `t-1`.

Our threshold for defection will be triggered if the **average proportion of cooperators in the previous round falls below a target proportion of cooperation, `P_target`.**

**Initial `P_target` and Adjustment:**

*   **Initial `P_target`:** Set to a value that, if met, guarantees a positive return from cooperation for *all* players. This occurs when `(k/n) * N_C > 0` for all players, which is always true if at least one player cooperates and `k > 0`. More strategically, to ensure *individual* gain from cooperation when others cooperate, we need `(1 - 1) + (k/n) * N_C > 1`, meaning `(k/n) * N_C > 1`. This implies `N_C > n/k`. Since `k < n`, `n/k > 1`. So, a reasonable target is to aim for a number of cooperators that makes contributing worthwhile for everyone. A good starting point for `P_target` could be `max(0.5, n/k / n)`. This ensures that if more than `n/k` players cooperate (meaning a single cooperator is better off contributing than defecting), we aim for that. We'll use `max(0.5, n/k / n)` as our baseline.

*   **Dynamic Adjustment of `P_target`:**
    *   If the *observed* average proportion of cooperators `Avg_C(t-1)` is consistently *above* `P_target`, we can *slightly decrease* `P_target` to reward sustained high cooperation. This makes it easier to maintain cooperation.
    *   If the *observed* average proportion of cooperators `Avg_C(t-1)` is consistently *below* `P_target`, we can *slightly increase* `P_target` to signal our desire for higher cooperation and become more sensitive to defection.

**How to Adjust `P_target`:**

We'll maintain a "cooperation score" for the group.

*   **Cooperation Score:** Start at `0`. In each round `t`, if `Avg_C(t-1) >= P_target`, increment the cooperation score by 1. If `Avg_C(t-1) < P_target`, decrement the cooperation score by 1.
*   **Adjusting `P_target`:**
    *   If Cooperation Score > `Threshold_Positive_Adjustment` (e.g., 5), decrease `P_target` by a small amount (e.g., 0.01). Reset Cooperation Score to 0.
    *   If Cooperation Score < `Threshold_Negative_Adjustment` (e.g., -5), increase `P_target` by a small amount (e.g., 0.01). Reset Cooperation Score to 0.
    *   Ensure `P_target` stays within reasonable bounds (e.g., `0 <= P_target <= 1`).

**The "Escalation Clause" (Trigger for Retaliation):**

While the primary decision is based on the group average, there's an underlying mechanism to detect and respond to persistent defection patterns that might be missed by the group average. This is for robustness.

*   **Individual Defection Count:** Maintain a count of how many times *we* have defected in previous rounds due to the group's behavior. Let this be `MyDefectionCount`.
*   **Trigger for Stronger Retaliation:** If `MyDefectionCount` exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., `r/4` or a fixed number like 5), and the group average cooperation *still* remains low, then we will defect regardless of the current group average for a few rounds. This signals a stronger intolerance for sustained low cooperation. After this period of stronger retaliation, we will revert to the standard group average rule, but with a potentially higher `P_target`.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t=1`):** In the absence of any history, the strategy defaults to its most cooperative state.
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**. This is to give cooperation a chance and to signal a cooperative intent.

*   **Last Round (`t=r`):** In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. The dominant strategy in a one-shot game with these parameters is to Defect. However, to be robust and potentially "trick" opponents into cooperating one last time, we can adopt a slightly different approach.
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**. While this might seem counter-cooperative, in the very last round, it maximizes individual gain. This is a pragmatic choice given the game structure. (Alternatively, one could choose to cooperate in the last round to "end on a good note," but defection is theoretically optimal for maximizing individual final payoff). *Self-correction: Given the instruction to "Be cooperative," and the goal of designing a cooperative strategy, let's reconsider the last round. A truly cooperative strategy might try to end with cooperation, even if it means a slightly lower payoff. However, in a tournament setting, maximizing payoff is key. Let's stick with defection for payoff maximization in the last round.* **Final decision for the last round: Defect (D).**

*   **When `k/n` is very small or very large:** The `P_target` calculation already incorporates `k/n`. If `k/n` is close to 1, cooperation is very beneficial and `P_target` will likely be low. If `k/n` is close to 0, cooperation is less beneficial, and `P_target` will be higher. The dynamic adjustment of `P_target` will further refine this.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The strategy is fundamentally cooperative because:

*   **Defaults to Cooperation:** It starts with cooperation and only defects when the group's collective behavior has demonstrated a sustained lack of it.
*   **Forgiving:** It doesn't immediately retaliate for a single defection. It looks for patterns and gives the group a chance to return to cooperation. The dynamic adjustment of `P_target` encourages this by becoming less strict when cooperation is high.
*   **Adaptive:** It learns from the history of play, adjusting its expectations (`P_target`) based on observed behavior. This allows it to adapt to different groups of opponents.
*   **Focus on Group Welfare (Indirectly):** By aiming for a level of cooperation where everyone benefits from contributing, it indirectly promotes the collective good. If sustained cooperation leads to higher rewards for everyone, the strategy will adapt to facilitate that.
*   **Escalation Clause as a Deterrent:** The escalation clause acts as a deterrent against persistent free-riding, signaling that sustained exploitation will not be tolerated, thus protecting the incentive for future cooperation.

description_COOPERATIVE_41 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust, relying only on game parameters and history.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

**Core Principle:** The ATFT strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection, but with a degree of forgiveness and a focus on learning. It starts cooperatively and adapts its behavior based on the collective actions of the group.

**1. Decision Rules:**

The core decision for player `i` in round `t` is based on the collective cooperation rate observed in the previous round `t-1`.

*   **If the collective cooperation rate in the previous round (t-1) was "high enough," player `i` will play Cooperate (C).**
*   **If the collective cooperation rate in the previous round (t-1) was "too low," player `i` will play Defect (D).**

**Defining "High Enough" and "Too Low":**

This is where the adaptive nature comes in. We need a threshold that is sensitive to the game's parameters (`n`, `k`) and the overall tendency for cooperation.

*   **Cooperation Threshold (`T_C`):** This is the minimum proportion of cooperators in the previous round required to trigger cooperation in the current round.
*   **Defection Threshold (`T_D`):** This is the maximum proportion of cooperators in the previous round that will still result in defection in the current round.

The ATFT strategy will dynamically adjust these thresholds based on observed behavior.

**Initial Thresholds (for Round 1):**

*   We start with a strong bias towards cooperation.
*   Initial `T_C` will be relatively high (e.g., `k / n + epsilon`, where `epsilon` is a small positive value to encourage initial cooperation).
*   Initial `T_D` will be relatively low (e.g., `k / n - epsilon`).

**Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **If the observed cooperation rate in round `t-1` was *above* `T_C`:** This suggests the group is cooperating well. We might slightly *increase* `T_C` to reward sustained cooperation, but not so much that a small dip leads to immediate defection. We might also slightly *decrease* `T_D` to make it harder for defection to become dominant.
*   **If the observed cooperation rate in round `t-1` was *below* `T_D`:** This signals widespread defection. We will *decrease* `T_C` significantly and *increase* `T_D` significantly to encourage a return to cooperation and punish sustained defection.
*   **If the observed cooperation rate was between `T_D` and `T_C`:** This represents a more uncertain state. We might keep the thresholds relatively stable or make minor adjustments based on the trend.

**The "Sweet Spot" for Cooperation:**

The ideal scenario is where the collective payoff from cooperation is higher than from defection.
If all cooperate, payoff is `(k/n) * n = k`.
If all defect, payoff is `1`.
If player `i` defects and others cooperate, payoff is `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`.
Player `i` defects if `1 + (k/n) * (n-1) > (k/n) * n`, which simplifies to `1 > k/n`, or `n > k`. This is always true by definition.
Player `i` cooperates if `(k/n) * n > 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`, which simplifies to `k > 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`.
`k - 1 > k - k/n`
`0 > -k/n` which is true.

However, a single defector benefits more than a cooperator *in that round*. The strategy needs to overcome this short-term incentive.

**A Simplified Decision Rule (for clarity and implementation):**

For player `i` in round `t` (where `t > 1`):

1.  **Calculate the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1`:**
    `CoopRate(t-1) = (Number of players who played C in round t-1) / n`

2.  **Decision:**
    *   **If `CoopRate(t-1) >= CooperationThreshold`:** Play C.
    *   **If `CoopRate(t-1) < CooperationThreshold`:** Play D.

**Adaptive `CooperationThreshold`:**

The `CooperationThreshold` will be a value between 0 and 1, dynamically adjusted.

*   **Initial `CooperationThreshold` (for round 2):** Set to a value slightly above `k/n`. For example, `k/n + 0.1` (ensuring it doesn't exceed 1). This encourages cooperation when the "fair share" of the public good for each cooperator is greater than their private return.
*   **Updating `CooperationThreshold` after round `t-1`:**
    *   **If `CoopRate(t-1)` was significantly higher than `CooperationThreshold` (e.g., `CoopRate(t-1) > CooperationThreshold + 0.2`):** Slightly increase `CooperationThreshold` by a small factor (e.g., `CooperationThreshold *= 1.05`). This rewards sustained high cooperation.
    *   **If `CoopRate(t-1)` was significantly lower than `CooperationThreshold` (e.g., `CoopRate(t-1) < CooperationThreshold - 0.2`):** Significantly decrease `CooperationThreshold` by a larger factor (e.g., `CooperationThreshold *= 0.9`). This attempts to pull the group back from defection.
    *   **If `CoopRate(t-1)` was close to `CooperationThreshold`:** Keep `CooperationThreshold` largely unchanged.

**Crucially, the `CooperationThreshold` will never drop below `k/n` (unless the history of defection is so severe that we enter a stable, low-cooperation state). This ensures we always aim for the point where individual cooperation is collectively beneficial.**

**3. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Decision:** Always play C.
    *   **Reasoning:** The ATFT strategy starts with a belief in the possibility of cooperation. There is no history to learn from, so the default is to initiate cooperation and signal a willingness to contribute. This aligns with the cooperative mindset and helps to establish a baseline.
*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always play D.
    *   **Reasoning:** In a finitely repeated game, the last round is effectively a one-shot game. The incentive to cooperate to foster future cooperation disappears. Therefore, it's rational to defect in the last round to maximize individual payoff, as there are no future consequences. This is a standard result in game theory for finitely repeated games.

**4. Being Cooperative:**

The ATFT strategy is fundamentally cooperative in spirit:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It starts by offering cooperation, giving others the chance to reciprocate.
*   **Reward for Cooperation:** It adapts to reward sustained high levels of cooperation by making cooperation slightly easier to maintain.
*   **Punishment for Defection (with forgiveness):** While it punishes defection by defecting itself, it doesn't immediately descend into complete defection. The adaptive thresholds aim to find a balance, allowing for a return to cooperation if the group starts to cooperate again. This is a form of forgiveness – not an immediate abandonment of cooperation after a single defection.
*   **Focus on Collective Benefit:** The thresholds are informed by `k/n`, the point where individual cooperation begins to be collectively beneficial. The strategy aims to steer the group towards this beneficial equilibrium.

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Game Parameters: n, r, k
// Player i's Strategy: ATFT

// State variables for Player i:
// History: List of actions taken by all players in previous rounds (optional, but useful for more complex adaptations)
// CurrentCooperationThreshold: float (initialized before the game)

// Initialization (before Round 1)
CurrentCooperationThreshold = k / n + 0.1 // Start slightly above break-even
if CurrentCooperationThreshold > 1.0:
    CurrentCooperationThreshold = 1.0

// Function for Player i's action in round t:
function decide_action(round_number, history_of_actions_in_previous_round):
    // history_of_actions_in_previous_round is a list of 'C' or 'D' for all n players

    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C' // Always cooperate in the first round

    if round_number == r:
        return 'D' // Always defect in the last round

    // Calculate cooperation rate in the previous round
    num_cooperators_prev_round = count('C' in history_of_actions_in_previous_round)
    coop_rate_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round / n

    // Decision rule
    if coop_rate_prev_round >= CurrentCooperationThreshold:
        action = 'C'
    else:
        action = 'D'

    // Adaptive adjustment of the threshold (after decision, for the *next* round)
    adjustment_factor = 1.0
    sensitivity = 0.2 // How far from the threshold is considered "significant"

    if coop_rate_prev_round > CurrentCooperationThreshold + sensitivity:
        adjustment_factor = 1.05 // Reward high cooperation
    elif coop_rate_prev_round < CurrentCooperationThreshold - sensitivity:
        adjustment_factor = 0.9 // Punish low cooperation
    // Else, keep adjustment_factor = 1.0

    CurrentCooperationThreshold = CurrentCooperationThreshold * adjustment_factor

    // Ensure threshold stays within bounds and prioritizes the break-even point
    CurrentCooperationThreshold = max(k / n, CurrentCooperationThreshold) // Don't go below break-even
    CurrentCooperationThreshold = min(1.0, CurrentCooperationThreshold)   // Don't go above 1

    return action

```

**Robustness and Adaptability:**

*   **Against Defection:** If opponents consistently defect, the `coop_rate_prev_round` will be low, `CurrentCooperationThreshold` will decrease, and the ATFT strategy will eventually join the defection, minimizing losses.
*   **Against Exploitation:** If a group of players tries to exploit cooperators by having a few defect while many cooperate, the `coop_rate_prev_round` will remain high, and the ATFT strategy will continue to cooperate, but its `CurrentCooperationThreshold` might slightly increase, making it a bit more robust to minor dips in cooperation later.
*   **Against Pure Cooperation:** If all players cooperate, the ATFT strategy will also cooperate, and its `CurrentCooperationThreshold` might increase, reinforcing stable cooperation.
*   **Parameter Dependence:** The initial threshold and the rationale for setting it are directly tied to `k/n`, acknowledging the game's parameters from the outset.

This ATFT strategy provides a solid foundation for cooperative behavior, adapting to the unfolding dynamics of the game without relying on external communication or predetermined patterns.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_42 = '''
This is an interesting challenge! The core tension in this N-Player Public Goods Game lies between the individual incentive to defect (to keep your endowment) and the collective benefit of cooperation (where the multiplied contributions lead to higher payoffs for everyone). Since we're aiming for a cooperative strategy that's adaptive and robust, we need a mechanism that encourages cooperation and punishes defection, but not so severely that it derails future cooperation.

Here's a strategy designed to achieve that, along with explanations for its design choices:

## Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Cooperation Threshold (TT-ACT)

This strategy builds upon the foundational "Tit-for-Tat" concept, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in pairwise repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. We'll adapt it for the N-player setting by incorporating an adaptive element that responds to the overall level of cooperation.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Be Nice:** Start by cooperating. This signals a willingness to cooperate and allows for mutual gains.
2.  **Retaliate:** Punish defection to deter future selfish behavior.
3.  **Forgive:** Return to cooperation once the opponent(s) return to cooperating. This prevents endless cycles of retribution.
4.  **Adapt:** Adjust the threshold for cooperation based on the observed behavior of other players. This makes the strategy resilient to different levels of group cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` depends on two main factors:

*   **The previous round's outcome:** Specifically, the proportion of players who cooperated in the *previous* round.
*   **An adaptive cooperation threshold:** This threshold determines how many cooperators are "enough" to warrant continued cooperation.

**Decision Logic for Player `i` in round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

Let `P_C(t-1)` be the proportion of players who cooperated in round `t-1`.
Let `T_C(t)` be the adaptive cooperation threshold for round `t`.

*   **If `P_C(t-1) >= T_C(t)`:** Player `i` plays **C** (Cooperate).
    *   This means that in the previous round, a sufficient number of players cooperated, indicating a generally cooperative environment.
*   **If `P_C(t-1) < T_C(t)`:** Player `i` plays **D** (Defect).
    *   This means that in the previous round, not enough players cooperated, signaling a tendency towards defection. Retaliation is necessary to encourage a return to cooperation.

**Updating the Adaptive Cooperation Threshold `T_C(t)`:**

The threshold `T_C(t)` is dynamically adjusted to maintain a balance between encouraging cooperation and not being overly naive. The goal is to have the threshold be "just enough" to trigger cooperation.

*   **Initial Threshold (`T_C(1)`):** For the first round, we assume a high likelihood of cooperation and set the initial threshold to be relatively low, but not so low that one defector can ruin everything. A good starting point could be `n * (k/n)` which is `k`, or slightly less. Let's set it to `k` for simplicity, as it represents a point where the collective gain from cooperation might start to outweigh individual defection, assuming everyone else cooperates.
    *   `T_C(1) = k`

*   **Threshold Update Rule (for `t > 1`):**
    *   **If `P_C(t-1) >= T_C(t-1)` (i.e., the group cooperated sufficiently in the previous round and we chose to cooperate):**
        *   We are incentivized to continue cooperation. We might slightly *lower* the threshold to encourage even more cooperation or to be more forgiving if the previous round was *just* at the threshold.
        *   `T_C(t) = max(1, T_C(t-1) - delta_low)` where `delta_low` is a small positive value (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2). We use `max(1, ...)` to ensure the threshold doesn't drop below 1, meaning at least one cooperator is needed.
    *   **If `P_C(t-1) < T_C(t-1)` (i.e., the group did not cooperate sufficiently and we chose to defect):**
        *   We need to be more cautious. We might slightly *raise* the threshold to ensure that future cooperation is more robust.
        *   `T_C(t) = min(n, T_C(t-1) + delta_high)` where `delta_high` is a small positive value (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2). We use `min(n, ...)` to ensure the threshold doesn't exceed `n` (meaning everyone must cooperate, which is too strict).

**Rationale for Threshold Update:**

*   **Lowering the threshold on cooperation:** This rewards past cooperation. If players are already cooperating sufficiently, we can afford to be a bit more lenient to solidify the cooperative norm.
*   **Raising the threshold on defection:** This is a form of "sticky punishment." If players are not cooperating enough, we demand a higher standard for cooperation to return. This makes it harder for defection to go unpunished.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t=1`):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** Always play **C** (Cooperate).
    *   **Rationale:** Start cooperatively. Assume good intentions and try to establish a cooperative norm. There's no history to learn from, so an initial cooperative stance is the most logical choice for a cooperative strategy.
    *   **Initial Threshold:** `T_C(1) = k`.

*   **Last Round (`t=r`):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** Always play **D** (Defect).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finitely repeated game, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. Each player faces a final, one-shot game. The rational choice in a one-shot public goods game where `k < n` is to defect. This is a standard result from game theory (though our strategy isn't purely rational in this sense, but it's a robust defensive measure).
    *   **Note:** This is a deviation from pure altruism but is a necessary pragmatic adaptation to avoid being exploited in the final round, which would lead to a suboptimal outcome for the player and the "spirit" of the cooperative strategy over the entire game.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is "cooperative" in its intent and general behavior:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It always starts with cooperation, aiming to build a mutually beneficial outcome.
*   **Proportionate Punishment:** It doesn't defect unilaterally. Defection is triggered by a lack of cooperation from *others*. The level of defection is directly tied to the observed lack of cooperation.
*   **Forgiveness:** It is designed to return to cooperation once a sufficient level of group cooperation is re-established. This allows for recovery from periods of defection.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The adaptive threshold ensures that the strategy doesn't remain overly punitive or overly naive. It aims to find a sustainable level of cooperation.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Global variables
n: integer (number of players)
r: integer (number of rounds)
k: float (multiplication factor)
delta_low: float (small value for lowering threshold, e.g., 0.1)
delta_high: float (small value for raising threshold, e.g., 0.1)

// Strategy state variables
current_round = 1
cooperation_threshold = k // Initialize threshold T_C(1)
last_round_cooperators_proportion = 0.0 // To store P_C(t-1)

function decide_action(history_of_actions, current_round_number, all_player_actions_in_prev_round):
    // history_of_actions: list of (player_id, action) tuples for previous rounds
    // current_round_number: integer t
    // all_player_actions_in_prev_round: list of actions (C or D) for all players in round t-1

    // Handle first round
    if current_round_number == 1:
        cooperation_threshold = k
        return "C" // Cooperate in the first round

    // Handle last round
    if current_round_number == r:
        return "D" // Defect in the last round

    // Calculate proportion of cooperators in the previous round
    num_cooperators_prev_round = count("C", all_player_actions_in_prev_round)
    last_round_cooperators_proportion = num_cooperators_prev_round / n

    // Apply decision rule based on previous round's cooperation and current threshold
    if last_round_cooperators_proportion >= cooperation_threshold:
        current_action = "C"
        // Adapt threshold: slightly lower it if cooperation was met
        cooperation_threshold = max(1.0, cooperation_threshold - delta_low)
    else:
        current_action = "D"
        // Adapt threshold: slightly raise it if cooperation was not met
        cooperation_threshold = min(float(n), cooperation_threshold + delta_high)

    return current_action

// Note: The 'history_of_actions' might not be directly used by this strategy's decision logic,
// but it's provided as context for general tournament strategies.
// 'all_player_actions_in_prev_round' is crucial for determining P_C(t-1).
```

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Robust to varying group sizes:** The proportional calculation `P_C(t-1)` and the threshold `T_C(t)` (which can be a float between 0 and `n`) naturally scale with `n`.
*   **Robust to different opponent behaviors:**
    *   **Always Cooperators:** If all players always cooperate, `P_C(t-1)` will always be 1. The threshold will gradually decrease (but not below 1), and the strategy will happily continue to cooperate.
    *   **Always Defectors:** If all players always defect, `P_C(t-1)` will always be 0. The threshold will gradually increase (but not above `n`), and the strategy will consistently defect after the first round.
    *   **Mixed Behaviors:** The adaptive threshold allows the strategy to "learn" the prevailing norm. If defection is common, the threshold rises, requiring more cooperation to trigger a return to cooperation. If cooperation starts to emerge, the threshold falls, reinforcing that behavior.
*   **Resilience:** The "sticky punishment" (raising the threshold after defection) prevents the strategy from being too easily exploited. It requires a sustained period of cooperation to lower the bar.
*   **Limited Forgiveness:** It's not infinitely forgiving. It needs to see evidence of sustained cooperation to fully trust again.

This TT-ACT strategy offers a balance between being cooperative and being able to defend against exploitation, making it a strong candidate for a tournament setting with diverse and unknown opponent strategies.

description_COOPERATIVE_43 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive, robust, and aligned with a cooperative mindset, while adhering to the specified constraints.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Reciprocity with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a crucial element of forgiveness to prevent a complete breakdown of cooperation due to isolated bad actors or specific round dynamics. It's based on the principle of "tit-for-tat" but adapted for a multi-player, repeated setting.

### Core Principle:

**"Cooperate initially, and then mirror the average behavior of the group, with a tendency to forgive."**

The strategy focuses on the collective outcome of the previous round rather than individual defections. This makes it robust to a single player defecting while the majority still cooperates.

### 1. Decision Rules:

*   **In any given round `t` (where `t > 1`):**
    *   **Calculate the average cooperation rate in the previous round (`t-1`).** Let this be `AvgCoopRate(t-1) = (Total Cooperators in round t-1) / n`.
    *   **If `AvgCoopRate(t-1)` is sufficiently high, cooperate (play C).**
    *   **If `AvgCoopRate(t-1)` is sufficiently low, defect (play D).**

*   **Defining "Sufficiently High" and "Sufficiently Low":**
    *   **Cooperate (C):** Play C if `AvgCoopRate(t-1) >= Threshold_Cooperate`.
    *   **Defect (D):** Play D if `AvgCoopRate(t-1) < Threshold_Defect`.
    *   **The "Forgiveness" Zone:** If `Threshold_Defect <= AvgCoopRate(t-1) < Threshold_Cooperate`, we need a rule to decide between C and D. This is where our adaptive mechanism comes in. We will lean towards cooperation but have a slight bias towards defection if there's a noticeable decline.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (`t=1`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always cooperate (play C). This is the initial hopeful gesture to establish cooperation and gather information about other players' tendencies. It's the most cooperative starting point.

*   **Last Round (`t=r`):**
    *   **Decision:** In the last round, there is no future to incentivize. This is a classic "end-game problem" in game theory. To maximize individual payoff in this final round, the rational strategy for any player is to defect.
    *   **Our Strategy's Approach (Cooperative Mindset):** Despite the theoretical incentive to defect, a truly cooperative strategy should still *attempt* to cooperate to the extent possible. However, it must also acknowledge the lack of future incentives.
    *   **Decision Rule for Last Round:** Play C *only if* the `AvgCoopRate(t-1)` in the second-to-last round (`r-1`) was above a very high threshold (e.g., `Threshold_Cooperate`). If the previous round's cooperation was not exceptionally high, defect to protect your endowment in the final round. This acknowledges the game's structure without abandoning the cooperative ideal entirely.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is cooperative in several ways:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It starts with cooperation, offering a chance for mutual benefit.
*   **Reward Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate when the group as a whole exhibits cooperation.
*   **Adaptive Punishment (with Forgiveness):** It punishes widespread defection, but not in a way that immediately triggers an irreversible spiral into defection. The thresholds and the "forgiveness zone" are key to this.
*   **Focus on Collective Outcome:** Decisions are based on the average behavior, promoting a sense of shared responsibility and the understanding that individual actions impact the group.

### Detailed Mechanism & Thresholds:

Let's refine the decision rules with concrete threshold ideas. These are starting points and can be tuned.

*   **`Threshold_Cooperate`:** A high bar for continuing cooperation. If the group consistently cooperates at this level, we will too. Let's propose `Threshold_Cooperate = 0.75 * n` (meaning 75% of players cooperated).
*   **`Threshold_Defect`:** A low bar below which widespread defection is evident. Let's propose `Threshold_Defect = 0.25 * n` (meaning 25% of players cooperated).
*   **The Forgiveness Zone ( `Threshold_Defect` <= `AvgCoopRate(t-1)` < `Threshold_Cooperate` ):**
    *   Here, we introduce a *slight bias towards cooperation*. If the previous round's cooperation rate was *above the midpoint* (i.e., `AvgCoopRate(t-1) >= 0.5 * n`), we lean towards cooperating.
    *   If the previous round's cooperation rate was *below the midpoint* (i.e., `AvgCoopRate(t-1) < 0.5 * n`), we lean towards defecting. This is a mild punishment for a dip in cooperation, but not an outright condemnation.

*   **Last Round (`t=r`) Decision Refinement:**
    *   Play C if `AvgCoopRate(r-1) >= Threshold_Cooperate_LastRound`.
    *   Play D otherwise.
    *   `Threshold_Cooperate_LastRound` should be very high, e.g., `0.9 * n`. This ensures that we only attempt cooperation in the last round if the group was almost entirely cooperative in the penultimate round.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Parameters
n: number of players
r: number of rounds
k: multiplication factor (not directly used in decision logic, but influences payoffs)

// History Storage
// total_cooperators_history = a list storing the number of cooperators for each past round

// Strategy function for player i
function PlayRound(current_round_t, total_cooperators_history):

  // Round 1: Always cooperate
  if current_round_t == 1:
    return C

  // Last Round (r): Cooperative approach with caution
  if current_round_t == r:
    if r == 1: // If only one round (edge case, but good to be robust)
        return C
    else:
        previous_round_cooperators = total_cooperators_history[r-2] // Indexing from 0
        avg_coop_rate_prev_round = previous_round_cooperators / n
        threshold_cooperate_last_round = 0.9 * n // Example threshold
        if avg_coop_rate_prev_round >= threshold_cooperate_last_round:
            return C
        else:
            return D

  // Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r): Adaptive reciprocity with forgiveness
  else:
    previous_round_cooperators = total_cooperators_history[current_round_t - 2] // Indexing from 0
    avg_coop_rate_prev_round = previous_round_cooperators / n

    threshold_cooperate = 0.75 * n  // Example threshold for full cooperation
    threshold_defect = 0.25 * n     // Example threshold for full defection
    midpoint_threshold = 0.50 * n   // Midpoint for forgiveness zone bias

    if avg_coop_rate_prev_round >= threshold_cooperate:
      // High cooperation in the past -> continue cooperating
      return C
    elif avg_coop_rate_prev_round < threshold_defect:
      // Low cooperation in the past -> defect
      return D
    else:
      // In the forgiveness zone: avg_coop_rate_prev_round is between threshold_defect and threshold_cooperate
      // Lean towards cooperation if the previous round was closer to cooperative
      if avg_coop_rate_prev_round >= midpoint_threshold:
        return C // Slight bias towards cooperation
      else:
        return D // Slight bias towards defection if cooperation is declining

```

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Robust to noise:** The use of average cooperation rate smooths out the impact of single rogue players. A single defector won't immediately trigger defection in the next round if the rest of the group cooperates.
*   **Adaptive:** The strategy responds to the observed behavior of the group. If cooperation flourishes, it continues to cooperate. If defection becomes widespread, it retaliates.
*   **Non-punitive to a fault:** The forgiveness mechanism prevents a swift descent into mutual defection. It gives opportunities for cooperation to be re-established.
*   **No reliance on specific opponents:** The strategy only uses game parameters and historical outcomes, making it independent of assumptions about other players' strategies.
*   **Alignment with cooperative principles:** The primary goal is to achieve mutual cooperation and higher payoffs for everyone, as demonstrated by the initial cooperation and the bias towards cooperation in ambiguous situations.

This strategy is designed to be a strong contender in a tournament, balancing the desire for high collective payoffs through cooperation with the necessity of self-protection against widespread defection.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_44 = '''
This is a fascinating problem that requires balancing the immediate temptation to defect with the long-term benefits of cooperation in a repeated game. The core challenge is to incentivize cooperation without explicit communication or coordination. My proposed cooperative strategy aims to achieve this through a history-dependent, retaliatory, and forgiving approach.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness"

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative but incorporates mechanisms to adapt to and punish defection, while also being robust enough to re-establish cooperation if possible.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to cooperate or defect in any given round is based on two primary factors:

*   **The overall cooperation level in the previous round.**
*   **The player's own action in the previous round (to a lesser extent).**

**The core logic:**

*   **Start cooperatively:** In the absence of information, the default behavior is to cooperate.
*   **Reciprocate cooperation:** If the overall level of cooperation was high in the previous round, continue to cooperate.
*   **Retaliate against defection:** If a significant number of players defected in the previous round, or if oneself was defected against by the majority, the strategy will defect.
*   **Forgive occasional defection:** If defection was an anomaly or a minor deviation from overall cooperation, the strategy will offer an opportunity to return to cooperation.

**Specific Decision Rules:**

Let $N$ be the total number of players.
Let $C_t$ be the total number of players who played 'C' in round $t$.
Let $D_t$ be the total number of players who played 'D' in round $t$.
Let $a_{i,t}$ be the action of player $i$ in round $t$ (1 for C, 0 for D).
Let $a_{own,t-1}$ be the action of the current player in the previous round ($t-1$).

**Decision for round $t$ (where $t > 1$):**

**If $t = 1$ (First Round):**
    *   Play **C** (Cooperate). This sets a cooperative tone and allows us to gather information.

**If $t > 1$:**

    *   **Calculate the "Cooperation Ratio" in round $t-1$:** $CR_{t-1} = C_{t-1} / N$.

    *   **Determine the "Defection Tolerance Threshold":** Let's define a threshold, `DEF_TOLERANCE`, which represents the maximum proportion of defectors we are willing to tolerate before we retaliate. A reasonable starting point could be `DEF_TOLERANCE = 0.5` (meaning if more than half the players defect, we retaliate). However, this can be adjusted based on tournament performance.

    *   **Primary Decision Logic:**
        *   **If $CR_{t-1} \ge 0.7$ (High Cooperation):** Play **C**. Even with a few defections, if the majority are cooperating, we continue to cooperate.
        *   **Else if $CR_{t-1} < DEF_TOLERANCE$ (Low Cooperation/High Defection):** Play **D**. If the level of cooperation drops significantly, it's time to punish.
        *   **Else (Moderate Cooperation, but below 0.7):** This is where forgiveness comes in.
            *   **If $a_{own,t-1} = D$ (I defected last round):** Play **C**. I've experienced the downside of defection in the previous round and want to give cooperation another chance.
            *   **If $a_{own,t-1} = C$ (I cooperated last round):**
                *   **If $CR_{t-1} \ge 0.4$ (Still a decent amount of cooperation):** Play **C**. This is an attempt to nudge the group back towards higher cooperation.
                *   **Else ($CR_{t-1} < 0.4$):** Play **D**. If there's moderate cooperation but I cooperated and still saw a significant number of defections, it's time to retaliate.

**Simplified Pseudocode for Decision Rule (t > 1):**

```pseudocode
function DecideAction(round_num, previous_round_actions, my_previous_action):
    N = total_players
    C_prev = count_cooperators(previous_round_actions)
    CR_prev = C_prev / N

    DEF_TOLERANCE = 0.5  // Can be tuned

    if round_num == 1:
        return 'C'
    else:
        if CR_prev >= 0.7:
            return 'C'  // High cooperation, continue cooperating
        elif CR_prev < DEF_TOLERANCE:
            return 'D'  // Low cooperation, retaliate
        else:  // Moderate cooperation (between DEF_TOLERANCE and 0.7)
            if my_previous_action == 'D':
                return 'C'  // I defected last, now try to cooperate
            else: // my_previous_action == 'C'
                if CR_prev >= 0.4:
                    return 'C'  // Moderate cooperation, I cooperated, try to encourage
                else:
                    return 'D'  // Moderate cooperation, I cooperated but others defected, retaliate
```

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round ($r=1$):** As stated above, always play **C**. This is crucial for establishing an initial cooperative baseline and allowing the strategy to gather information about the environment.
*   **Last Round ($r$):** For the final round, the incentive structure fundamentally changes. In a single-shot game, defecting is always the dominant strategy in the last round if players are purely rational and self-interested. However, this is a *repeated* game, and the strategy has built a history of interaction. Given that there are no future rounds to influence, the most rational action to maximize payoff in *this specific round* is to defect. Therefore, **in the very last round ($t=r$), always play D**. This is a pragmatic adjustment to the cooperative ideal, acknowledging the end of the game.
*   **No History (First Round):** Handled by the "always C" rule.
*   **All Players Cooperate:** The strategy will continue to cooperate as long as the cooperation ratio remains high.
*   **All Players Defect:** The strategy will quickly switch to defecting after observing the first round's outcome, aligning with the majority's behavior.
*   **Oscillating Behavior:** The forgiveness mechanism is designed to break cycles of mutual defection. If there's a brief dip in cooperation, the strategy will try to return to cooperation, offering a chance for the group to stabilize. If this is met with further defection, it will retaliate.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its *intent* and *default behavior*.

*   **"Always C" in the first round:** This demonstrates a willingness to initiate and build cooperation.
*   **Reciprocating high cooperation:** The strategy rewards sustained cooperative behavior with continued cooperation.
*   **Forgiveness:** The strategy doesn't immediately punish every single defection. It allows for a period of potential recovery and encourages a return to cooperative norms by offering an olive branch after its own prior defection or a moderate level of overall cooperation.
*   **Adaptive:** It adapts to the environment. If cooperation is prevalent, it's highly cooperative. If defection becomes rampant, it becomes defensive and retaliatory to protect its own payoff.

The strategy aims to be a **"generous cooperator"**. It starts by trusting and cooperating, is willing to punish significant deviations from cooperation, but is also willing to forgive and try to re-establish cooperation if the environment shows signs of improvement. This approach is designed to be robust in a tournament setting where opponent behaviors can be diverse and unpredictable.

The choice of thresholds (0.7, `DEF_TOLERANCE`, 0.4) can be seen as parameters of its cooperativeness and retaliatory nature, and might be fine-tuned through simulation or experimental observation of tournament performance. For example, a higher `DEF_TOLERANCE` would make it more forgiving, while a lower `DEF_TOLERANCE` would make it more quick to retaliate.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_45 = '''
This strategy is designed to encourage cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection, while also accounting for the repeated nature of the game and the need for adaptability. It aims to maintain a cooperative equilibrium as long as possible, but is prepared to defend its interests if cooperation breaks down.

## Cooperative Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness

This strategy is based on the principle of "tit-for-tat," but with enhancements to make it more robust and forgiving, especially in a multi-player setting with potential for errors or misinterpretations.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Start Cooperatively:** Assume the best and initiate cooperation.
2.  **Reciprocate:** Mirror the collective behavior of the group in the previous round.
3.  **Forgive, but Don't Forget:** Punish defections but offer opportunities for re-cooperation.
4.  **Be Adaptable:** Adjust behavior based on sustained patterns of cooperation or defection.

### Decision Rules:

The strategy's decision for player `i` in round `t` (`Action(i, t)`) depends on the *average* action of all players in the previous round `t-1`.

1.  **Calculate Average Cooperation in Previous Round:**
    Let `TotalCooperators(t-1)` be the number of players who played 'C' in round `t-1`.
    Let `AverageCooperation(t-1) = TotalCooperators(t-1) / n`.

2.  **Decision Logic:**

    *   **If `AverageCooperation(t-1)` is above a certain threshold `C_threshold`:**
        Player `i` plays **C (Cooperate)**.

    *   **If `AverageCooperation(t-1)` is below `C_threshold` but above a lower threshold `D_threshold`:**
        Player `i` plays **D (Defect)**. This is a punitive response to a dip in cooperation.

    *   **If `AverageCooperation(t-1)` is below `D_threshold` and has been consistently below it for a certain number of past rounds (`Punishment_Streak`):**
        Player `i` plays **D (Defect)**. This is to signal that cooperation is no longer viable and to maximize personal gain.

    *   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** If player `i` has been playing 'D' due to the previous thresholds, and in the *next* round `AverageCooperation(t)` suddenly jumps significantly *above* `C_threshold`, player `i` will revert to playing **C (Cooperate)** in round `t+1`. This allows for recovery from temporary dips.

### Parameter Tuning:

The effectiveness of this strategy relies on carefully chosen thresholds and streak lengths. These parameters should ideally be adaptive or set based on an initial learning phase if allowed, but for a fixed strategy, reasonable starting points can be:

*   `C_threshold`: A value slightly above the point where individual defection is not profitable for the defector if everyone else cooperates. Given `k < n`, the payoff for a defector is `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. The payoff for a cooperator is `(k/n) * n = k`. For defection to be individually rational *when others cooperate*, we need `1 + (k/n) * (n-1) > k`. This simplifies to `1 > k/n`, which is always true given `k < n`. However, cooperation is socially optimal when `k > 1`. To encourage cooperation, the threshold should reflect a strong expectation of group benefit. A good starting point could be `C_threshold = 0.7` (70% cooperation).
*   `D_threshold`: A value below which sustained defection is likely. This could be `D_threshold = 0.3` (30% cooperation).
*   `Punishment_Streak`: The number of consecutive rounds below `D_threshold` that triggers sustained defection. A value of `2` or `3` rounds is often effective.
*   `Forgiveness_Trigger_Threshold`: The minimum increase in average cooperation needed to forgive sustained defection. A significant jump, e.g., from `D_threshold` up to `C_threshold` or higher, would trigger forgiveness.

### Handling Edge Cases:

1.  **First Round (`t = 1`):**
    *   Player `i` always plays **C (Cooperate)**. This initiates cooperation and signals a willingness to engage in the public good.

2.  **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   In the final round, the incentive to cooperate disappears because there are no future rounds to reciprocate or punish. The rational strategy is to defect.
    *   Therefore, for `t = r`, player `i` always plays **D (Defect)**.

        // A more complex version might switch to 'D' for a single round
        // to signal disapproval, but for robustness, we'll stick to 'C' here.
        return 'C'

```

### Reasoning for Cooperative Mindset Alignment:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by assuming the best-case scenario and contributing to the public good, aligning with a cooperative intent.
*   **Reciprocity:** The core mechanism of mirroring the group's behavior is fundamentally cooperative. If the group is cooperative, the strategy rewards that by cooperating.
*   **Punishment as Deterrent, Not Retaliation:** Defection is triggered by a *sustained* decline in group cooperation, indicating that cooperation is no longer collectively beneficial or is being exploited. This is a pragmatic response to protect the player's own payoff, not an act of malice.
*   **Forgiveness:** The strategy includes a mechanism to resume cooperation if the group demonstrates a significant return to cooperative behavior. This allows for recovery from temporary lapses and fosters an environment where cooperation can be re-established.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** The strategy is not rigidly fixed. While the pseudocode uses fixed parameters for demonstration, in a more advanced implementation, these thresholds could adapt based on the overall performance and observed behavior in the tournament. This adaptability is crucial for a robust strategy in an unknown environment.

This strategy aims to be a stable cooperator in an environment where cooperation is mutually beneficial (i.e., when `k > 1`), but it is not a naive cooperator. It learns from the group's behavior and adjusts its actions to maximize its long-term payoff while preserving the possibility of cooperative equilibria.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_46 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Cooperative Strategy: The "Reciprocity with Forgiveness" Strategy

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a built-in mechanism for forgiveness to prevent cycles of mutual defection. It's designed to be played in a repeated game environment where learning from history is possible.

### Core Principle:

The fundamental idea is to start cooperatively and maintain cooperation as long as the group's average behavior is sufficiently cooperative. If defection becomes too prevalent, the strategy will temporarily defect to signal disapproval and incentivize a return to cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) for player `i` in round `t` is based on a moving average of the *proportion* of cooperators in the previous rounds.

*   **Define a "Cooperation Threshold" (CT):** This threshold represents the minimum average proportion of cooperators in the history that we consider acceptable for continued cooperation. A good starting point for CT would be `(k + 1) / n`.
    *   **Rationale:** If `k+1` players cooperate, the total contribution is `k+1`. Each player's share is `(k/n) * (k+1)`. If `k` is the number of cooperators, each cooperator gets `0 + (k/n) * k`. Each defector gets `1 + (k/n) * k`. When `k = k+1`, the payoff for cooperators is `0 + (k/n) * (k+1)` and defectors is `1 + (k/n) * (k+1)`. To make cooperation strictly better than defection for an individual, `(k/n) * (k+1) > 1 + (k/n) * (k+1)`. This is impossible. However, when `k+1` players cooperate, the total payoff for the group is `(k/n) * (k+1)`. If `k+1` players cooperate, each gets `(k/n)*(k+1)`. If `n` players cooperate, each gets `(k/n)*n = k`. This is greater than 1 if `k>1`. The threshold `(k+1)/n` is chosen because if *at least* `k+1` players cooperate, the total contribution `(k+1)` multiplied by `k/n` might lead to a sufficient payoff for cooperation. More formally, if `C` is the number of cooperators, a cooperator's payoff is `(k/n) * C`, and a defector's payoff is `1 + (k/n) * C`. For cooperation to be individually rational when everyone else cooperates (`C=n`), `(k/n) * n > 1 + (k/n) * n`, which simplifies to `k > 1 + k`, which is impossible. However, if everyone cooperates, the payoff is `k`. If everyone defects, payoff is 1. Cooperation is socially optimal if `k > 1`. The threshold `(k+1)/n` aims to ensure that if the average proportion of cooperators is above this, the expected return from cooperation is positive and potentially beneficial.

*   **Maintain a Moving Average of Cooperation (MAC):** This is the average proportion of cooperators observed in *all* previous rounds.
    *   `MAC_t = (Σ(s=1 to t-1) (total_cooperators_in_round_s / n)) / (t-1)` (for `t > 1`)
    *   For the first round, this value is undefined or can be considered 0.

*   **Decision Rule:**
    *   **If `MAC_t` (or a default value for the first round) >= `CT`:** Player `i` plays **C**.
    *   **If `MAC_t` < `CT`:** Player `i` plays **D**.

*   **Forgiveness Mechanism (Soft Defection):** To prevent prolonged cycles of mutual defection when the group falls below the threshold, we introduce a limited capacity for forgiveness. This is achieved by occasionally reverting to cooperation even when the average is low.
    *   **Introduce a "Forgiveness Counter" (FC):** This counter tracks how many times the strategy has defected due to the `MAC < CT` condition.
    *   **Decision Rule with Forgiveness:**
        *   **If `MAC_t` >= `CT`:** Player `i` plays **C**.
        *   **Else (if `MAC_t` < `CT`):**
            *   **If `FC < F_max` (where `F_max` is a pre-defined maximum number of forgiveness "opportunities", e.g., 2 or 3):** Player `i` plays **C**. Increment `FC`.
            *   **Else (if `FC >= F_max`):** Player `i` plays **D**. Reset `FC = 0` for the next time the condition `MAC < CT` is met.

    *   **Rationale for Forgiveness:** If the group has been largely defecting, a single round of cooperation might be due to a change in strategy or a signal from others. Forgiving a few instances of defection allows the group to potentially recover and return to cooperation without the strategy immediately locking into perpetual defection.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Since there is no history, the strategy must make an initial choice.
    *   **Decision:** Player `i` plays **C**.
    *   **Rationale:** To initiate cooperation and signal a cooperative intent. This is the most cooperative starting point. The forgiveness counter is initialized to 0.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   In a truly last round with no future, the incentive to cooperate disappears, and defecting becomes the Nash Equilibrium for each player individually.
    *   **Decision:** Player `i` plays **D**.
    *   **Rationale:** To maximize individual payoff in the absence of future consequences. This is a standard outcome in finitely repeated games when there's no explicit coordination or punishment mechanism that extends beyond the game.

*   **When `k` is very close to `n`:** The `CT = (k+1)/n` might become very high, close to 1. This strategy will be sensitive to any defection.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its design:

*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** It always starts by cooperating.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards sustained cooperation by continuing to cooperate.
*   **Punishment of Defection:** It punishes sustained defection by defecting itself.
*   **Forgiveness:** It includes a mechanism to recover from periods of defection, giving the group a chance to re-establish cooperation. This is crucial for robustness against temporary lapses or testing by other strategies.
*   **Adaptive:** The decision-making is entirely based on observed history, adapting to the group's behavior.
*   **Parameter Dependence:** The Cooperation Threshold `CT` is directly derived from the game parameters (`k` and `n`), ensuring its relevance to the game's payoff structure.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Strategy Parameters
SET CT = (k + 1.0) / n
SET F_max = 3 // Example value for forgiveness opportunities

// State Variables (per player)
VARIABLE cooperation_history = [] // List of (total_cooperators, n) for each round
VARIABLE forgiveness_counter = 0

// Function to determine action for round t
FUNCTION get_action(t, current_history):
  // Update history with results from previous rounds
  // current_history is a list of tuples: [(round_num, total_cooperators), ...]

  IF t == 1 THEN
    // First round: Initiate cooperation
    RETURN "C"
  END IF

  IF t == r THEN
    // Last round: Defect to maximize immediate payoff
    RETURN "D"
  END IF

  // Calculate Moving Average of Cooperation (MAC) for previous rounds
  total_previous_cooperators = 0
  num_previous_rounds = 0
  FOR EACH round_data IN current_history DO
    IF round_data.round_num < t THEN
      total_previous_cooperators += round_data.total_cooperators
      num_previous_rounds += 1
    END IF
  END FOR

  MAC = 0.0
  IF num_previous_rounds > 0 THEN
    MAC = total_previous_cooperators / (num_previous_rounds * n)
  END IF

  // Decision Logic
  IF MAC >= CT THEN
    // Maintain cooperation when group is sufficiently cooperative
    forgiveness_counter = 0 // Reset forgiveness when cooperation is strong
    RETURN "C"
  ELSE
    // Group has become too defection-prone
    IF forgiveness_counter < F_max THEN
      // Utilize forgiveness opportunities
      forgiveness_counter += 1
      RETURN "C"
    ELSE
      // Used up forgiveness, defect to signal disapproval
      forgiveness_counter = 0 // Reset for the next period of low cooperation
      RETURN "D"
    END IF
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Robustness Considerations:

*   **Against "All D":** If other players always defect, `MAC` will quickly fall below `CT`. The strategy will initially cooperate (round 1), then defect after `F_max` rounds of observing mostly defection. This prevents it from being exploited indefinitely.
*   **Against "Grim Trigger" (or similar punishing strategies):** If another player defects once and then plays `D` forever, the `MAC` will eventually drop, and this strategy will also start defecting, but with the forgiveness mechanism it might recover if the "Grim Trigger" player reverts to cooperation.
*   **Against Tit-for-Tat-like strategies:** This strategy is more forgiving than a strict Tit-for-Tat in larger groups. If a few players defect, this strategy might still cooperate for a few rounds due to forgiveness, allowing the group to self-correct.
*   **Adaptability:** The `MAC` ensures that the strategy constantly re-evaluates the group's behavior and adjusts its own. The `CT` acts as a stable target for desired group behavior.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between encouraging cooperation and protecting itself from exploitation, making it a strong contender in a diverse tournament environment.

Here's a strategy designed for cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness to various opponent behaviors.

## Strategy: "Conditional Cooperator with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by initially cooperating, rewarding continued cooperation, and punishing defection, but with a mechanism for forgiveness to encourage a return to cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of this strategy is a state-based approach that tracks the recent history of cooperation. We'll maintain a "cooperation level" which influences the decision to cooperate or defect.

*   **Initial State:** Start in a "Cooperative" state.
*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   The current cooperation level is "High" or "Moderate".
    *   Or, if the current cooperation level is "Low" and the opponent has shown signs of returning to cooperation in the last round.
*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   The current cooperation level is "Low" AND there were more defectors than cooperators in the previous round.
    *   Or, if the current cooperation level is "Moderate" and there was a significant increase in defection in the previous round.

### 2. State Transitions and Cooperation Level:

We'll define three states for our "cooperation level":

*   **High Cooperation:** The vast majority of players cooperated in the last round.
*   **Moderate Cooperation:** A significant portion of players cooperated, but not overwhelmingly so.
*   **Low Cooperation:** Most players defected, and cooperation is scarce.

The transition between these states is triggered by observing the **proportion of cooperators in the previous round**. Let $N_C$ be the number of cooperators in the previous round.

*   **Transition to High Cooperation:** If $N_C \ge \lceil n \times (1 - (k/n)) \rceil + 1$ (i.e., significantly more cooperators than defectors, considering the incentive to defect $k<n$). This threshold ensures that even with the temptation to defect, a strong majority chose to cooperate.
*   **Transition to Moderate Cooperation:** If $\lceil n/2 \rceil \le N_C < \lceil n \times (1 - (k/n)) \rceil + 1$. This is the default state when cooperation is present but not dominant.
*   **Transition to Low Cooperation:** If $N_C < \lceil n/2 \rceil$. This signifies a breakdown in cooperation.

**Forgiveness Mechanism:** To prevent being stuck in a cycle of mutual defection, we introduce a forgiveness element. If the strategy is in the "Low Cooperation" state and observes an *increase* in the number of cooperators compared to the previous round, it will "forgive" past defections and transition back to "Moderate Cooperation". This is especially important if the increase is substantial.

### 3. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** As a cooperative strategy, we will **always Cooperate (C)** in the first round, regardless of game parameters. This sets a positive initial tone and attempts to establish cooperation from the outset.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the last round, the incentive to defect becomes overwhelming for rational players who only care about their total payoff. Since our strategy is designed for a repeated game and assumes perfect information, we can anticipate this. Therefore, in the last round, we will **always Defect (D)**. This is a pragmatic decision to maximize our own payoff in a one-shot scenario.

### 4. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative because:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It starts by trying to build a cooperative environment.
*   **Reward for Cooperation:** It maintains cooperation when others cooperate.
*   **Adaptive Punishment:** It punishes defection, but the punishment is not absolute. It aims to deter defection and encourage a return to cooperation.
*   **Forgiveness:** The forgiveness mechanism is crucial. It prevents a single round of defection from leading to permanent mutual defection, allowing for the re-establishment of cooperative norms.
*   **Parameter-Driven Thresholds:** The thresholds for state transitions are informed by the game parameters ($k$ and $n$), reflecting an understanding of the incentives within the game. For example, when $k/n$ is closer to 1, the incentive to defect is lower, and thus the threshold for "High Cooperation" can be set higher.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Game Parameters: n, r, k

// Internal State Variables
current_cooperation_level = "Cooperative" // Can be "High", "Moderate", "Low"
previous_round_cooperators = 0

function DecideAction(round_number, history):

    // Handle Last Round
    if round_number == r:
        return D

    // Handle First Round
    if round_number == 1:
        current_cooperation_level = "Cooperative" // Initialize to cooperative state
        return C

    // Determine number of cooperators in the previous round
    if round_number > 1:
        num_players_in_prev_round = n
        cooperators_in_prev_round = count_cooperators(history[round_number - 2]) // Access the actions from the previous round
        previous_round_cooperators = cooperators_in_prev_round
    else:
        cooperators_in_prev_round = 0 // No previous round for round 1

    // Update Cooperation Level based on previous round's outcome
    // Thresholds are based on game parameters and incentives.
    // These thresholds can be fine-tuned.
    high_cooperation_threshold = ceil(n * (1 - (k/n))) + 1
    moderate_cooperation_threshold = ceil(n / 2)

    if cooperators_in_prev_round >= high_cooperation_threshold:
        current_cooperation_level = "High"
    elif cooperators_in_prev_round >= moderate_cooperation_threshold:
        current_cooperation_level = "Moderate"
    else:
        // Check for forgiveness if in Low Cooperation state
        if current_cooperation_level == "Low":
            if cooperators_in_prev_round > previous_round_cooperators: // Improvement in cooperation
                current_cooperation_level = "Moderate" // Forgive and try to return to cooperation
        else:
            current_cooperation_level = "Low"

    // Make Decision based on current cooperation level
    if current_cooperation_level == "High":
        return C
    elif current_cooperation_level == "Moderate":
        // If there was a significant drop in cooperation in the previous round, defect
        if cooperators_in_prev_round < previous_round_cooperators and (previous_round_cooperators - cooperators_in_prev_round) > (n / 4): // Heuristic for significant drop
            return D
        else:
            return C
    elif current_cooperation_level == "Low":
        // If we are in Low cooperation, and there were more defectors than cooperators, defect
        if cooperators_in_prev_round < (n / 2):
            return D
        else:
            // If cooperation is just barely above 50%, but we are in Low state, still cautious
            // and possibly defect, but if it's increasing, we've already handled that.
            // For simplicity, if not increasing, and still Low, defect.
            return D

// Helper function to count cooperators in a list of actions
function count_cooperators(actions_list):
    count = 0
    for action in actions_list:
        if action == C:
            count = count + 1
    return count

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Adjustments:**

*   **`current_cooperation_level`**: This variable now tracks the observed state.
*   **`previous_round_cooperators`**: This helps in detecting significant drops or increases.
*   **Thresholds**: The thresholds `high_cooperation_threshold` and `moderate_cooperation_threshold` are calculated based on the game parameters. These are simplified representations and could be further refined. The `high_cooperation_threshold` is set to a level where cooperation is significantly advantageous over defection even if others defect.
*   **Forgiveness Logic**: Explicitly checks if the `current_cooperation_level` is "Low" and if there's an improvement in the number of cooperators to transition back to "Moderate".
*   **Moderate Cooperation Decision**: Added a heuristic to defect if there was a *significant drop* in cooperation from the previous round, even if it's still in the "Moderate" state. This adds a layer of responsiveness.
*   **Low Cooperation Decision**: In "Low" cooperation, if it's not improving (handled by forgiveness), we defect if cooperators are below half, and even if it's slightly above half, given the "Low" state, we remain cautious and defect.

This strategy aims to balance the desire for long-term cooperation with the need to protect oneself from exploitation. Its adaptiveness comes from its ability to change its behavior based on the collective actions of the group, and its robustness is enhanced by the forgiveness mechanism that prevents short-term deviations from leading to perpetual conflict.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_48 = '''
Here's a strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, aiming for cooperation while being adaptive and robust. This strategy emphasizes a long-term perspective, rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, but with a forgiving element.

## Cooperative Adaptive Strategy (CAS)

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding observed cooperation and punishing observed defection, but with a mechanism to "reset" to cooperation if the group shows a sustained return to cooperative behavior.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of CAS is a dynamic decision rule that balances the immediate incentive to defect with the long-term benefits of group cooperation.

*   **Initial State (First Round):** Cooperate. The assumption is that the best outcome for the group is everyone cooperating, and this is the most direct way to attempt to achieve that.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **If the player *i* defected in round *t-1*:**
        *   **If all other players *j ≠ i* cooperated in round *t-1*:** Cooperate in round *t*. This is a signal that the player might have made a mistake or had a one-off reason to defect, and the group is still on a cooperative path.
        *   **Otherwise (at least one other player *j ≠ i* also defected in round *t-1*):** Defect in round *t*. This is a retaliatory action, signaling that defection will not be tolerated and will be met with similar behavior.

    *   **If the player *i* cooperated in round *t-1*:**
        *   **If all other players *j ≠ i* also cooperated in round *t-1*:** Cooperate in round *t*. This reinforces successful group cooperation.
        *   **If at least one other player *j ≠ i* defected in round *t-1*:** Defect in round *t*. This is a punishment for the observed defection from others, aiming to deter future defections.

**Rationale for this rule:**

*   **Cooperative Start:** Beginning with cooperation sets a positive initial signal.
*   **Reciprocity with a Twist:** It's broadly similar to Tit-for-Tat, but adapted for an N-player setting. It punishes any observed defection from the group, not just a single individual.
*   **Forgiveness:** The "If all other players *j ≠ i* cooperated in round *t-1*" condition after player *i* defected is crucial. It allows for a quick return to cooperation if the player realizes their defection was an outlier and the group is still committed to cooperation. This prevents a spiral into mutual defection due to a single player's misstep.
*   **Punishment:** Defecting when others defect is a clear signal that sustained defection will be met with similar behavior, discouraging free-riding.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always Cooperate (C). This is the most optimistic and inclusive start.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the last round, the future consequences of actions are removed. The dominant strategy for a rational player in a single-shot game is to defect, as there are no future rounds to be penalized or rewarded. Therefore, **always Defect (D) in the last round.** This is a pragmatic adaptation to the game's structure.

*   **Rounds with Limited Information:** While perfect information is assumed, in a tournament setting, there might be subtle differences in how actions are observed or if certain actions are misreported. This strategy is robust because it reacts to the *observed* history of actions, not to assumptions about other players' strategies. If there's a discrepancy in observed actions, the strategy will react accordingly based on the available (though potentially imperfect) information.

*   **Early Rounds and Potential "Chaos":** If in early rounds, the group consistently defects, this strategy will quickly adapt and defect as well, to avoid being exploited. The "forgiveness" mechanism is primarily designed to recover from a single player's defection, not to sustain cooperation against a fully defecting group.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is designed to be cooperative in spirit by:

*   **Prioritizing Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating and continues to cooperate as long as the group demonstrates cooperative behavior.
*   **Creating Incentives for Cooperation:** The punishment mechanism (defecting when others defect) aims to deter free-riding and encourage others to contribute to the collective good, ultimately leading to higher payoffs for everyone in the long run.
*   **Allowing for Recovery:** The forgiveness mechanism prevents a single defection from permanently derailing cooperation, promoting resilience in the face of mistakes or initial uncertainty.
*   **Maximizing Group Payoff (Potentially):** By fostering an environment where cooperation is rewarded and sustained, the strategy aims to reach the highest possible group payoff (where everyone cooperates and gets a payoff of 2 per round with the given parameters).

Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness within the given constraints:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Reciprocal Kindness with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a crucial element of forgiveness to prevent being locked into cycles of mutual defection.

**Core Principle:** Start cooperatively and reciprocate past behavior, but allow for a limited number of defections from others before defaulting to permanent defection.

### 1. Decision Rules:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the very first round, always cooperate (play C). This sets a positive precedent and signals a willingness to contribute to the public good.

*   **Reciprocity with Threshold:** In subsequent rounds (t > 1):
    *   **If all other players cooperated in the previous round (t-1):** Play C. This reinforces successful cooperation.
    *   **If at least one other player defected in the previous round (t-1):**
        *   **Count past defections:** Keep track of how many times, in total across all previous rounds, at least one other player has defected. Let this count be `total_past_defections`.
        *   **Check forgiveness threshold:** If `total_past_defections` is below a predetermined threshold (e.g., `forgiveness_threshold`), then play C. This allows for some tolerance of individual defections.
        *   **If `total_past_defections` meets or exceeds the `forgiveness_threshold`:** Play D. This signals that the strategy has experienced too much defection and will no longer contribute to the public good if it's not reciprocated broadly.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** As stated above, always play C. This is crucial for initiating cooperation in a repeated game.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** The strategy's behavior in the last round is determined by the reciprocity rule. If the cumulative history of defections has not triggered the forgiveness threshold, it will continue to cooperate. If it has, it will defect. There's no special "end game" adjustment beyond the general rule because the goal is to maximize overall cooperation across the game, not to try and extract a final bit of payoff. Since communication is not allowed and players don't know the exact end of the game (though in this specification, 'r' is fixed, but the strategy itself shouldn't *assume* it knows the absolute last round for future rounds in a more general sense), it's best to maintain the established pattern.

*   **Initial `total_past_defections`:** This variable should be initialized to 0 before the first round.

*   **`forgiveness_threshold`:** This is a crucial parameter that balances cooperation with self-preservation. A good starting point would be a value related to the number of rounds, for example, `r / 4` or a small constant like 2 or 3. The optimal value might depend on the specific tournament dynamics, but for this general strategy, a moderate value is recommended to allow for adaptation.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative due to:

*   **Initial Altruism:** Always starting with cooperation, even without any guarantee of reciprocation.
*   **Rewarding Cooperation:** Actively choosing to cooperate when others have demonstrated cooperative behavior.
*   **Forgiveness:** Allowing for a limited number of defections before resorting to sustained defection. This acknowledges that individual players might make mistakes, or that a temporary deviation doesn't necessarily mean a permanent lack of cooperative intent. This "forgiveness" is what makes the strategy robust to fluctuating opponent behavior, preventing it from being easily exploited by short-term defectors.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```
// Strategy: Reciprocal Kindness with Forgiveness

// Game Parameters (provided externally)
// n: number of players
// r: number of rounds
// k: multiplication factor

// Internal State Variables
let total_past_defections = 0
let forgiveness_threshold = ceil(r / 4) // Example threshold, can be tuned

function decide_action(current_round, history):
    // history is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a round:
    // (my_action, player1_action, player2_action, ..., playerN_action)
    // my_action and player_i_action are 'C' or 'D'

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C' // Always cooperate in the first round

    // Determine if any other player defected in the previous round
    let other_players_defected_last_round = false
    if current_round > 1:
        let last_round_actions = history[current_round - 2] // history is 0-indexed
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            // Assume my action is not part of the history for this check,
            // we are only interested in *other* players' actions.
            // This needs careful implementation based on how history is structured.
            // For now, let's assume history[round_index] is a list of ALL players' actions.
            // If history[t-1] contains actions from round t-1.
            if last_round_actions[i] == 'D' and i != my_player_index: // my_player_index is unknown here, a common simplification is to check all actions assuming you are not checking your own past action directly
                other_players_defected_last_round = true
                break

    // Update total_past_defections based on the last round
    if other_players_defected_last_round:
        total_past_defections += 1

    // Decision based on reciprocity and forgiveness threshold
    if total_past_defections >= forgiveness_threshold:
        return 'D' // Too many defections, switch to permanent defection
    else:
        return 'C' // Continue to cooperate, offering forgiveness

// --- End of Function ---
```

**Notes on Pseudocode:**

*   The `history` parameter would need to be structured to contain the actions of all players in previous rounds.
*   The `my_player_index` is a hypothetical variable to ensure we're not counting our *own* defection when checking "other players." In a real implementation, you'd need to know which element in the `history` corresponds to your own action. If the `history` only stores *other* players' actions for a given round, the logic simplifies. For this strategy, we are checking if *anyone* other than us defected.
*   The `forgiveness_threshold` is a hyperparameter that can be tuned. A smaller value makes the strategy more responsive to defection, while a larger value makes it more tolerant. `ceil(r / 4)` is a heuristic that provides a reasonable starting point.

This strategy is designed to be resilient. It doesn't demand perfect cooperation but seeks to cultivate it through consistent positive reinforcement, while having a clear, albeit forgiving, exit strategy from cooperation if it's consistently undermined.

## Cooperative Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding contributions and punishing defection, while remaining adaptable to various player behaviors. It's a tit-for-tat-like approach adapted for a public goods setting.

### Core Principle: Reciprocity and Conditional Cooperation

The fundamental idea is to cooperate as long as others cooperate, and to defect when others defect. However, given the nature of the public goods game, a purely reactive tit-for-tat can be problematic. Instead, we adopt a strategy that is *optimistic* about cooperation but *punitive* towards consistent defection.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

Our strategy has two primary modes of operation: **Cooperative Mode** and **Punishment Mode**.

**a) Cooperative Mode:**

*   **Initial State:** Start in Cooperative Mode.
*   **Decision to Cooperate (C):** Cooperate in the current round if:
    *   The total number of cooperators in the *previous* round was greater than or equal to `n * (k/n)` (i.e., the number of players required to make the average payoff from cooperation at least as good as the payoff from defection for *all* players).
    *   *OR* the player is in the first round.
*   **Decision to Defect (D):** Defect in the current round if:
    *   The total number of cooperators in the *previous* round was strictly less than `n * (k/n)`.
    *   *OR* the player is in the last round and the conditions for cooperation are not met (see Edge Cases).

**b) Punishment Mode:**

*   **Trigger:** Enter Punishment Mode if the player has observed more than a certain threshold of "net defection" over a specified lookback window. "Net defection" can be defined as the number of times a player defected minus the number of times they cooperated. A simpler approach for now is to track the *proportion* of players who defected in the previous round. If this proportion is too high, it signals widespread non-cooperation.
*   **Decision to Cooperate (C):** Cooperate only if the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round was equal to `n` (everyone cooperated). This is a very high bar to exit Punishment Mode.
*   **Decision to Defect (D):** Defect in all other cases while in Punishment Mode.

**Refinement of "Net Defection" Trigger:**

To make the transition to Punishment Mode more robust, we'll use a threshold-based system.

*   **Threshold:** We define a **Cooperation Ratio Threshold (CRT)**. This is a float between 0 and 1.
*   **Entering Punishment Mode:** If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round falls below `CRT`, the strategy enters **Punishment Mode**.
*   **Exiting Punishment Mode:** The strategy only exits **Punishment Mode** when it has observed a period of consistent high cooperation. Specifically, it will exit if the proportion of cooperators in the previous `P_window` rounds (a parameter, e.g., 3-5 rounds) has been above a certain **Recovery Threshold (RT)**, where `RT > CRT`.

**Simplified Decision Rules (for clarity and initial implementation):**

We'll start with a simpler, more direct approach and then add complexity if needed.

*   **Rule 1 (Initial Cooperation):** In the first round (`t=1`), always Cooperate (C).
*   **Rule 2 (Conditional Cooperation):** In subsequent rounds (`t > 1`):
    *   If the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round (`t-1`) was greater than or equal to `round(n * k/n)` (the minimum number of cooperators for the average payoff to be at least 1), then Cooperate (C).
    *   Otherwise, Defect (D).
*   **Rule 3 (Punishment Phase - Implied):** If Rule 2 consistently leads to defection, the strategy will naturally enter a cycle of defection. To make it more proactive, we can introduce a "Forgiveness" element.

**Introducing Forgiveness and a Dynamic Punishment Threshold:**

Pure defection can be suboptimal if other players are also trying to cooperate but are being punished. We need a mechanism to re-enter cooperation.

Let's redefine the rules with a forgiveness mechanism:

*   **Initialization:**
    *   `total_cooperators_prev_round = n` (Assume full cooperation initially for robustness)
    *   `punishment_phase = False`
    *   `punishment_counter = 0`
    *   `cooperation_streak = 0`

*   **Decision Logic for Round `t`:**

    1.  **If `punishment_phase` is `True`:**
        *   If `total_cooperators_prev_round == n`:
            *   `punishment_phase = False`
            *   `punishment_counter = 0`
            *   `cooperation_streak += 1`
            *   Cooperate (C)
        *   Else:
            *   `punishment_counter += 1`
            *   Defect (D)
            *   If `punishment_counter > P_threshold` (a parameter, e.g., 3-5 rounds of sustained low cooperation):
                *   `punishment_phase = False` # Give up on prolonged punishment
                *   `punishment_counter = 0`
                *   `cooperation_streak = 0` # Reset streak

    2.  **If `punishment_phase` is `False`:**
        *   Let `min_cooperators_for_stability = round(n * k/n)`
        *   If `total_cooperators_prev_round >= min_cooperators_for_stability`:
            *   `cooperation_streak += 1`
            *   `punishment_counter = 0` # Reset punishment counter if we are cooperating
            *   Cooperate (C)
        *   Else (`total_cooperators_prev_round < min_cooperators_for_stability`):
            *   `cooperation_streak = 0` # Break streak
            *   `punishment_counter += 1`
            *   Defect (D)
            *   If `punishment_counter > P_threshold`: # Enter punishment if low cooperation persists
                *   `punishment_phase = True`
                *   `punishment_counter = 0` # Reset counter when entering punishment

*   **Update `total_cooperators_prev_round`:** After the round is played, update this variable with the actual count of cooperators in the *current* round for the *next* round's decision.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (r=1, or t=1 in r>1):** Always Cooperate (C). This is an optimistic start to encourage cooperation and see how others behave.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** This is a crucial edge case in repeated games, as future repercussions disappear.
    *   In the last round, the incentive to cooperate for future gains is zero. The dominant strategy for a rational player in the *single-shot* game is to defect, as your payoff is maximized by keeping your endowment.
    *   Therefore, in the last round, regardless of previous history, **always Defect (D)**. This reflects the understanding of the single-shot nature of the final round.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is inherently cooperative by:

*   **Starting with cooperation:** It gives others the benefit of the doubt and initiates a cooperative environment.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** It rewards and sustains cooperation by cooperating as long as the group exhibits a minimum level of cooperative behavior (defined by `min_cooperators_for_stability`). This aligns with the idea that "if you do your part, I'll do mine."
*   **Punishment, not Retaliation:** The punishment phase is not an endless cycle of defection. It's a mechanism to signal dissatisfaction and to encourage a return to cooperation. The `punishment_counter` and the eventual exit from `punishment_phase` demonstrate a willingness to forgive and re-engage if the group moves back towards cooperation.
*   **Focus on Group Outcome:** The condition `total_cooperators_prev_round >= round(n * k/n)` is not just about individual benefit but aims to achieve a state where the collective benefit from cooperation is at least as good as the individual benefit from defecting for everyone. This fosters a sense of shared well-being.

      return C
    else:
      punishment_counter = punishment_counter + 1
      if punishment_counter > P_threshold:
        punishment_phase = true // Enter punishment if low cooperation persists

// Update state after a round
function update_state(actual_cooperators_this_round):
  total_cooperators_prev_round = actual_cooperators_this_round
  current_round = current_round + 1

```

This strategy is designed to be adaptive by responding to the group's behavior, robust by having a punishment mechanism and a recovery mechanism, and cooperative by starting optimistically and aiming for mutual benefit. The `P_threshold` can be tuned based on observed tournament performance to balance responsiveness with stability.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_51 = '''
This is an interesting strategic challenge! Designing a cooperative strategy in a repeated Public Goods Game with the specified parameters requires a balance of encouraging cooperation and protecting oneself from exploitation. The core tension lies in the fact that individually, defecting is always the rational choice in a single round, regardless of others' actions, because the marginal return of cooperating is less than the marginal return of defecting for any individual player. However, in a repeated game, sustained cooperation can lead to higher collective payoffs.

Here's a cooperative strategy designed for this environment, focusing on adaptiveness and robustness:

## Cooperative Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Threshold

This strategy aims to promote cooperation by mirroring the behavior of the group, but with a built-in resilience to defection and a mechanism to "forgive" or re-initiate cooperation after periods of low group contribution. It adapts based on the observed collective behavior, aiming to maximize long-term group payoff while safeguarding individual interests.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core principle is to cooperate as long as the group is "cooperating enough." The "enough" is defined by a threshold based on the observed level of cooperation in previous rounds.

*   **Cooperate (C) IF:** The average contribution in the previous round was above a certain adaptive threshold.
*   **Defect (D) IF:** The average contribution in the previous round was at or below the adaptive threshold.

The adaptive threshold will be introduced and explained below.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** The first round is a "leap of faith." Initiating cooperation sets a positive precedent and allows for the possibility of reaching the mutually beneficial outcome of full cooperation. Given the absence of prior history, starting cooperatively is the most direct path to enabling collective gains.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is a crucial strategic element for a repeated game played with an end. The last round acts as a finitely repeated game. Just as in a single-round game, the rational choice is to defect to maximize one's immediate payoff, knowing there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. This is often referred to as "backward induction." By defecting in the last round, we ensure we are not exploited.

*   **Penultimate Round (t = r-1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)** IF the group's average contribution in round `r-2` was above the adaptive threshold. Otherwise, **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This round is influenced by the last round's decision. If the group has been cooperating reasonably well up to this point, we want to continue that cooperation in the hope it continues into the very last round. However, if the group has already started to degrade cooperation, we would follow suit.

### 3. Being Cooperative & Adaptive Threshold Mechanism:

The "adaptive threshold" is the key to making this strategy cooperative yet robust. It dynamically adjusts based on the observed collective behavior.

**Adaptive Threshold Calculation:**

Let $AvgC_{t-1}$ be the average contribution (proportion of players who played C) in the previous round (round $t-1$).

*   **Initial Threshold (for round t=2):** Set to 1 (meaning, we expect everyone to cooperate in round 1 for us to cooperate in round 2).
*   **Updating the Threshold (for round t > 2):**
    *   If $AvgC_{t-1} \ge \text{Current Threshold}$:
        *   The threshold is **decreased** slightly. This represents a "reward" for good collective behavior, making it easier to trigger cooperation in the future. A small decrease allows for forgiveness and re-initiation of cooperation.
        *   *Example update rule:* `New Threshold = max(0.1, Current Threshold * 0.95)` (We cap it at 0.1 to avoid it becoming trivially low).
    *   If $AvgC_{t-1} < \text{Current Threshold}$:
        *   The threshold is **increased** slightly. This represents a "punishment" for poor collective behavior, requiring a higher level of group cooperation to earn back our cooperation.
        *   *Example update rule:* `New Threshold = min(1.0, Current Threshold * 1.05)` (We cap it at 1.0).

**Putting it Together (Decision Rule Refined):**

For player $i$ in round $t$:

*   **If t = 1:** Play **C**.
*   **If t = r:** Play **D**.
*   **If 1 < t < r:**
    *   Calculate the average contribution of all players in round $t-1$: $AvgC_{t-1} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{j, t-1}}{n}$, where $c_{j, t-1} = 1$ if player $j$ played C in round $t-1$, and $0$ otherwise.
    *   If $AvgC_{t-1} \ge \text{Current Threshold}$: Play **C**.
    *   If $AvgC_{t-1} < \text{Current Threshold}$: Play **D**.
    *   Update the `Current Threshold` for the next round based on the rules above.

### 4. Pseudocode:

```
// Parameters:
// n: number of players
// r: number of rounds
// k: multiplication factor

// State variables:
// current_threshold: float, initialized for round 2
// player_actions_history: list of lists, to store actions of all players in each round

Initialize player_actions_history = []
Initialize current_threshold = 1.0 // Expected cooperation level from round 1 to trigger cooperation in round 2

// Strategy for player i in round t:
function decide_action(player_id, t, n, r, k, player_actions_history, current_threshold):

    // Handle Edge Cases
    if t == 1:
        return 'C'
    if t == r:
        return 'D'

    // Calculate Average Contribution from previous round
    previous_round_actions = player_actions_history[t-2] // Indexing from 0 for history
    total_cooperators_last_round = sum(1 for action in previous_round_actions if action == 'C')
    avg_contribution_last_round = total_cooperators_last_round / n

    // Decision Rule based on Adaptive Threshold
    if avg_contribution_last_round >= current_threshold:
        decision = 'C'
        // Update threshold: Reward good behavior, make cooperation easier
        new_threshold = current_threshold * 0.95
        current_threshold = max(0.1, new_threshold) // Cap at a minimum to avoid triviality
    else:
        decision = 'D'
        // Update threshold: Punish poor behavior, require more cooperation
        new_threshold = current_threshold * 1.05
        current_threshold = min(1.0, new_threshold) // Cap at maximum

    // Update state for next round (implicitly done by returning the new threshold in a real implementation)
    return decision, current_threshold

// In the tournament loop:
// For each round t from 1 to r:
//   Get all player actions from the previous round (or start with an empty history for t=1)
//   For each player i:
//     action_i, updated_threshold_i = decide_action(i, t, n, r, k, player_actions_history, current_threshold_i)
//     Store action_i
//     Update current_threshold_i for player i (if strategy is player-specific)
//   Record all actions for round t in player_actions_history
```

### 5. Alignment with Cooperative Mindset:

*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** The strategy begins by cooperating, signaling a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial outcomes.
*   **Reciprocity:** It mirrors the group's collective behavior. If the group cooperates, it cooperates; if the group defects, it defects. This "tit-for-tat" on a group level is a fundamental cooperative mechanism.
*   **Forgiveness/Re-initiation:** The decreasing threshold mechanism allows the strategy to "forgive" periods of low cooperation. If the group shows signs of returning to higher levels of contribution, the threshold lowers, making it easier for our strategy to re-initiate cooperation and pull the group back towards a cooperative state. This is crucial for long-term cooperation and recovery from defection spirals.
*   **Maximizing Group Payoff (Conditionally):** By aiming for sustained cooperation when possible, the strategy inherently seeks to maximize the total group payoff, as demonstrated by the example calculations where full cooperation yields the highest individual payoffs.

This strategy is designed to be robust because it doesn't rely on perfect play from others. It can withstand temporary defections and attempts to exploit its cooperative nature by gradually increasing the required level of cooperation. However, it also gives the group a chance to recover and re-establish cooperation, making it a valuable strategy in a repeated Public Goods Game.

description_COOPERATIVE_52 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, emphasizing adaptiveness and robustness.

## Cooperative Strategy: Grim Trigger with Forgiveness

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative, aiming for mutual benefit through sustained cooperation. It incorporates a "grim trigger" mechanism to punish defection but includes a limited form of forgiveness to allow for the re-establishment of cooperation if conditions improve.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core decision-making process revolves around a **cooperation threshold**. This threshold represents the minimum level of cooperation observed in the previous round that justifies continuing to cooperate.

*   **If the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round (let's call it `prev_cooperators`) is greater than or equal to a predefined `cooperation_threshold`:**
    *   **Action:** Play **C** (Cooperate).

*   **If the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round (`prev_cooperators`) is *less* than the `cooperation_threshold`:**
    *   **Action:** Play **D** (Defect).

**Determining the `cooperation_threshold`:**

The `cooperation_threshold` is a crucial parameter that adapts to the game's history. It's initialized and then adjusted based on observed behavior.

*   **Initialization (First Round):** In the first round, since there's no history, we start with a strong bias towards cooperation. The strategy will play **C**.

*   **Subsequent Rounds:**
    *   **If the strategy *played* C in the previous round:**
        *   If `prev_cooperators` was greater than or equal to the strategy's *own* `cooperation_threshold` from the previous round, then the `cooperation_threshold` remains the same for the current round.
        *   If `prev_cooperators` was *less* than the strategy's `cooperation_threshold` from the previous round, the `cooperation_threshold` increases slightly. This reflects a need for stronger evidence of widespread cooperation to continue cooperating.
    *   **If the strategy *played* D in the previous round:**
        *   If `prev_cooperators` was greater than or equal to a *reduced* `cooperation_threshold` (a lower bar for forgiveness), the `cooperation_threshold` decreases. This allows for the re-establishment of cooperation if a significant portion of players still cooperated despite the strategy's defection.
        *   If `prev_cooperators` was *less* than the reduced `cooperation_threshold`, the `cooperation_threshold` remains the same or increases slightly, indicating continued distrust.

**A More Precise (Conceptual) Rule for `cooperation_threshold` Update:**

Let `T_t` be the `cooperation_threshold` for round `t`.
Let `C_t-1` be the total number of cooperators in round `t-1`.
Let `A_{i, t-1}` be the action of player `i` in round `t-1`.

*   **Round 1:** Play C. `T_1` is initialized to a high value (e.g., `n * 0.8` - aiming for a large majority to cooperate initially).

*   **Round t > 1:**
    *   **If `A_{i, t-1}` == C:**
        *   If `C_{t-1}` >= `T_{t-1}`: `T_t = T_{t-1}`
        *   If `C_{t-1}` < `T_{t-1}`: `T_t = min(n, T_{t-1} + delta_increase)`  (where `delta_increase` is a small positive value, e.g., 1 or 2 players)
    *   **If `A_{i, t-1}` == D:**
        *   Let `forgiveness_threshold = T_{t-1} * 0.7` (or some other factor representing a lower bar for re-establishing trust).
        *   If `C_{t-1}` >= `forgiveness_threshold`: `T_t = max(1, T_{t-1} - delta_decrease)` (where `delta_decrease` is a small positive value, e.g., 1 or 2 players, to encourage re-cooperation).
        *   If `C_{t-1}` < `forgiveness_threshold`: `T_t = T_{t-1}` (or `T_t = min(n, T_{t-1} + delta_increase)` if we want to be extra cautious after failed attempts at cooperation).

**The Core Logic in Summary:**

*   **Start cooperative:** Always cooperate in the first round.
*   **Reward cooperation:** If there was enough cooperation in the previous round, continue cooperating.
*   **Punish defection:** If there wasn't enough cooperation, defect.
*   **Forgive gradually:** If you defected, but a reasonable number of others *still* cooperated, be open to returning to cooperation sooner than a strict "never forgive" policy.
*   **Adapt the bar:** Adjust the "enough cooperation" threshold based on past outcomes. If cooperation falters, raise the bar for future cooperation. If you defect and cooperation persists (even at a lower level), you can lower the bar for your own return to cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** Always play **C**.
    *   **Reasoning:** To establish a cooperative baseline and give others a chance to reciprocate. There's no historical data to base a decision on, so defaulting to cooperation is the most cooperative initial stance.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** Play **D** (Defect).
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a standard backward induction argument in repeated games. Since there are no future rounds to influence, the incentive to cooperate is gone. Each player will act in their own immediate self-interest, which is to maximize their payoff in this final round. Since `k < n`, the individual payoff from defecting is always higher than cooperating in the absence of future consequences.
        *   If player `i` plays C: `π_i = (k/n) × total_contributions`
        *   If player `i` plays D: `π_i = 1 + (k/n) × (total_contributions - 1)`
        *   The difference is `1 - (k/n)`. Since `k < n`, `k/n < 1`, so `1 - (k/n) > 0`. Thus, playing D yields a higher payoff.

*   **Rounds between the first and last (1 < t < r):**
    *   The decision rules described in section 1 (cooperation threshold, adaptation) apply.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is inherently cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Default to Cooperation:** It begins by assuming the best and attempting to foster cooperation.
*   **Mutual Benefit Focus:** The goal is to achieve a state where most players cooperate, leading to higher collective and individual payoffs (`2` in the example calculation for all players cooperating vs. `1` for all defecting).
*   **Conditional Cooperation, Not Unconditional Defection:** It punishes defection but doesn't abandon cooperation permanently after a single instance of sub-optimal play. The "grim trigger" is softened by "forgiveness" mechanisms.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The strategy learns from past outcomes and adjusts its expectations, making it robust to varying levels of cooperation from other players. It doesn't rigidly stick to a losing strategy.
*   **Maximizing Long-Term Payoff (implicitly):** By aiming for sustained cooperation, it seeks to maximize the total payoff over the `r` rounds, assuming other players are also capable of sustained cooperation.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

    if my_last_action == 'C':

            # Cooperation was sufficient, maintain threshold
            cooperation_threshold = previous_cooperation_threshold
        else:

            cooperation_threshold = min(n, previous_cooperation_threshold + delta_increase)
    else: # my_last_action == 'D'
        forgiveness_threshold = previous_cooperation_threshold * forgiveness_factor
        if total_cooperators_last_round >= forgiveness_threshold:
            # Some cooperation persisted even after defection, allow for re-cooperation
            cooperation_threshold = max(1, previous_cooperation_threshold - delta_decrease)
        else:
            # Cooperation also dropped significantly after defection, keep threshold same or increase cautiously
            cooperation_threshold = previous_cooperation_threshold # Or min(n, previous_cooperation_threshold + delta_increase)

    # Decide action for current round
    if total_cooperators_last_round >= cooperation_threshold:
        my_last_action = 'C'
        return 'C'
    else:
        my_last_action = 'D'
        return 'D'

```

This strategy aims to be a good cooperative partner while being pragmatic about the realities of repeated games and the potential for selfish behavior from others. Its adaptability allows it to respond to a dynamic environment.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a mechanism for returning to cooperation if the group converges. It's designed to be adaptive and robust in a repeated game setting with perfect information and common knowledge.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of this strategy is a **tit-for-tat** like approach, but with a crucial element of forgiveness to prevent perpetual defection cycles.

*   **Initial State:** Begin by cooperating.
*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Monitor the total number of cooperators in the previous round (t-1).**
    *   **Cooperate (C) IF:**
        *   The total number of cooperators in the previous round was **greater than or equal to a threshold**. This threshold represents a "tipping point" for sustained cooperation.
        *   **OR** (This is the forgiveness mechanism): If the strategy has defected in the *immediately preceding round*, but the total number of cooperators in the round *before that* was sufficiently high, indicating a brief lapse rather than a sustained pattern of defection.
    *   **Defect (D) IF:**
        *   The total number of cooperators in the previous round was **less than the threshold**. This signals that cooperation is not being reciprocated by the group.
        *   **OR** If the strategy has defected in the *immediately preceding round* and the conditions for forgiveness are not met.

#### Defining the Threshold:

The threshold for sustained cooperation is critical. It should be set to encourage cooperation when it's demonstrably benefiting the group, while also triggering defection when defection is prevalent.

*   **Proposed Threshold:** `Threshold = n - floor(n/2)` (i.e., more than half the players cooperated).
    *   **Rationale:** This ensures that cooperation is only sustained when a clear majority of players are contributing. If less than half cooperate, the return on investment for a cooperator is too low (payoff can be equal to or less than defecting), making defection individually rational.

#### Forgiveness Mechanism Details:

*   The strategy will track its own previous action.
*   If the strategy played 'D' in round `t-1`, it will check the number of cooperators in round `t-2`.
*   If `total_cooperators_t-2 >= Threshold` and `total_cooperators_t-1 < Threshold` (and the strategy itself played 'D' in `t-1`), the strategy will forgive and cooperate in round `t`. This acknowledges that a single round of low cooperation might be an anomaly, and returning to cooperation might re-establish a positive norm.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the initial "olive branch." It sets a cooperative tone and allows the strategy to observe the general behavior of other players before making any punitive decisions.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the last round of a repeated game with no future consequences, the temptation to defect is strongest because there's no incentive to maintain a cooperative relationship. This is a common adaptation in game theory for the final round. While the core strategy is cooperative, it recognizes the strategic reality of the final round.

*   **Initial Behavior of Others:** The strategy is robust because it doesn't assume any initial cooperative behavior. If others defect from the start, the strategy will eventually switch to defection after observing consistently low cooperation.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The overarching principle is to foster a high level of cooperation, but through a learned and responsive mechanism rather than blind altruism.

*   **Pro-Cooperation:** The default action is cooperation. The strategy only defects when it perceives a significant lack of reciprocation.
*   **Adaptive:** It adjusts its behavior based on the observed history of cooperation within the group.
*   **Forgiving:** The forgiveness mechanism allows for the re-establishment of cooperation even after periods of defection, preventing lock-in to mutual defection.
*   **Self-Correction:** If the group shifts towards cooperation, the strategy will reward that by cooperating, leading to higher collective payoffs.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, while also accounting for the repeated nature of the game and the specific parameters. It's designed to be adaptive and robust.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Grinder"

The core idea of the "Conditional Grinder" strategy is to start cooperatively and maintain cooperation as long as the collective action benefits all players. However, it will defect strategically to punish sustained defection and try to re-establish a cooperative equilibrium. The strategy is named "Grinder" because it aims to "grind down" defection by making it less profitable over time.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision rule for player `i` in round `t` is based on the following:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, always cooperate (play C). This sets a cooperative tone and allows us to observe initial behavior.

*   **Continued Cooperation:** In subsequent rounds `t > 1`, player `i` will play C if:
    *   The total number of cooperators in the previous round `t-1` was sufficiently high to make cooperation collectively beneficial.
    *   OR if there has been a history of consistent cooperation and the expected future payoff from cooperation remains positive.

*   **Conditional Defection (Punishment):** Player `i` will play D if:
    *   There has been a significant increase in defection in the previous round, and this defection has demonstrably reduced player `i`'s payoff.
    *   OR if the overall level of cooperation has fallen below a threshold where the collective benefit of cooperation is no longer realized.

*   **Reintegration (Forgiveness):** If player `i` has defected in previous rounds due to perceived defection from others, they will reconsider cooperation if a majority of players return to cooperation. This prevents indefinite cycles of mutual defection.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always play **C**. This is our initial gesture of good faith and establishes a baseline for observing other players' behavior.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the very last round, the strategic incentive to cooperate for future rounds disappears. Therefore, the rational decision in the last round is to **D** regardless of past history. This is a standard outcome in finite repeated games with no external enforcement mechanism.

*   **Near the End of the Game (t = r-1, r-2, ...):** As the game approaches its end, the incentive to defect increases. The strategy should consider this decreasing future horizon. For rounds close to the end (e.g., the last 2-3 rounds, but *before* the absolute last round), the strategy will be more inclined to defect if it perceives a pattern of defection, as the opportunity for future cooperation-based rewards is diminishing.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The "Conditional Grinder" strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its intent and initial action. It seeks to establish and maintain a high level of cooperation because it understands that this is the outcome that maximizes the *total* payoff for all players in the long run (when `k > 1`).

The defection mechanism is not malicious but is a calculated response to protect the collective good and incentivize others to return to cooperation. It's a form of "reciprocity" or "tough love" designed to restore the cooperative equilibrium rather than to purely maximize individual short-term gain at the expense of others.

```

### Explanation of Logic and Adaptability

1.  **Initial Cooperative Stance:** Starting with 'C' is crucial. It signals a willingness to cooperate and establishes a baseline. If others cooperate, this strategy will happily continue.

2.  **Threshold for Cooperation:** The `min_cooperators_for_benefit` heuristic is central. It's derived from the payoff function. For an individual to get at least their endowment back (payoff >= 1), the total contribution must be `n/k`. If `k < n`, then `n/k > 1`, meaning at least two cooperators are needed to ensure everyone gets their endowment back if they contribute. If `k` is close to `n`, this threshold is lower. If `k` is much smaller than `n`, the threshold is higher. This makes the strategy adaptable to different `k` values.

3.  **Punishment Phase:** When cooperation drops below the threshold, the strategy enters a "punishment phase." It defects to signal dissatisfaction and to try and make sustained defection unprofitable for others. This is not a permanent punishment; it's a tool to try and *restore* cooperation.

4.  **Reintegration:** The `punishment_phase` has a condition for exiting. If a sufficient number of players (e.g., 60% heuristic) return to cooperation, the strategy will also return to cooperating. This is vital to avoid getting stuck in mutual defection cycles. It "forgives" past defections if the collective behavior shifts back towards cooperation.

5.  **Last Round Logic:** The explicit 'D' in the last round is a standard Nash Equilibrium in finite repeated games. A rational player will defect when there are no future consequences.

6.  **Robustness:**
    *   **Against High Defection:** If many players defect, the cooperation threshold won't be met, and this strategy will also defect, entering the punishment phase. It doesn't get exploited by a wave of defectors.
    *   **Against Low Defection:** If only a few players defect, but enough others cooperate, the threshold is met, and this strategy continues to cooperate, rewarding the cooperative majority.
    *   **Against Randomness:** The strategy doesn't react to single defections but rather to sustained low levels of cooperation or significant drops. This makes it less susceptible to noise.
    *   **Adaptability to k:** The `min_cooperators_for_benefit` calculation is directly tied to `k`, making the strategy's thresholds dynamically adjust to the game's parameters.

This "Conditional Grinder" strategy aims to be a strong contender by promoting cooperation, punishing defection to restore it, and being robust to various opponent behaviors and game parameter settings.

Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Threshold"

This strategy is inspired by the success of Tit-for-Tat in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma but adapted for the public goods setting. It aims to foster cooperation by reciprocating cooperative behavior, but also incorporates a mechanism to defend against exploitation.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Be Nice:** Start by cooperating. This sets a positive tone and is the foundation of cooperative play.
2.  **Reciprocate:** If others cooperate, you cooperate. This rewards good behavior.
3.  **Punish Exploitation:** If others defect in a way that significantly harms you or the collective, you defect. This discourages free-riding.
4.  **Forgive (Eventually):** After a period of sustained punishment, be willing to return to cooperation if the other players show signs of doing so.

### Strategy Breakdown:

#### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of this strategy is a dynamic assessment of the "cooperation level" observed in the previous round and a comparison against an "adaptive threshold."

*   **Initial State:** In the first round, always cooperate (play C).

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Calculate Observed Cooperation Ratio (OCR):** In the previous round (t-1), count the number of players who cooperated ($N_C^{t-1}$) and the total number of players ($n$). The OCR is $OCR^{t-1} = N_C^{t-1} / n$.
    *   **Maintain an Adaptive Threshold (T):** This threshold represents the minimum cooperation ratio we deem acceptable to continue cooperating.
        *   **Initial Threshold (T_1):** Set an initial threshold based on game parameters. A reasonable starting point could be slightly above the payoff-maximizing defection point for an individual player. For example, if everyone else defects, your payoff from cooperating is $(k/n)$, and from defecting is 1. You'd want the collective to contribute enough so that $(k/n) \times N_C > 1$. A simpler, more robust initial threshold could be related to the point where the collective benefit outweighs individual cost. Let's set an initial threshold, $T_{initial} = \max(0.5, k/n)$. This ensures that even with a moderate $k/n$, we expect some level of cooperation.
        *   **Adapting the Threshold:**
            *   **If $OCR^{t-1} \ge T^{t-1}$ (Previous round was sufficiently cooperative):** We are encouraged. We *might* cooperate. The threshold remains stable or slightly decreases to encourage even more cooperation in the future. $T^t = \max(0.2, T^{t-1} - 0.05)$ (We don't want the threshold to go too low, maintaining a floor).
            *   **If $OCR^{t-1} < T^{t-1}$ (Previous round was insufficiently cooperative):** We are discouraged. We are more likely to defect. The threshold *increases*, signaling that we require a higher level of cooperation to trust. $T^t = \min(0.9, T^{t-1} + 0.10)$ (We don't want the threshold to become impossible to meet).
    *   **Decision Logic for Round t:**
        *   **If $OCR^{t-1} \ge T^{t-1}$:** Play **C**. We are willing to continue cooperating as the group met our threshold.
        *   **If $OCR^{t-1} < T^{t-1}$:** Play **D**. The group failed to meet our cooperation threshold, and we will punish this by defecting.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always play **C**. This is the "niceness" principle. It's an attempt to initiate cooperation.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the final round, the incentives shift. Since there are no future rounds to build trust or retaliate, the dominant strategy for any rational player in a single-shot game is to defect. Therefore, in the last round, this strategy will **always play D**. This is a necessary adaptation to the known end of the game.

*   **Sustained Defection:** If, for several consecutive rounds, the $OCR$ remains below the threshold and the strategy consistently plays **D**, the threshold will increase. However, if in a round *after* sustained defection, the $OCR$ *suddenly* increases significantly (e.g., everyone cooperates for a round), the strategy should be sensitive to this change and potentially return to cooperation. The adaptive threshold handles this naturally. If $OCR$ jumps above the *current* high threshold, we'll cooperate.

#### 3. Cooperativeness:

This strategy is inherently cooperative by design:

*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating in the first round, offering an olive branch.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation with cooperation. If others are playing nice, we will too.
*   **Focus on Collective Good:** The decision to cooperate or defect is based on the *collective* action of the group (the $OCR$), not just the action of a single opponent. This reflects a focus on the overall health of the public good.
*   **Adaptive Nature:** The adaptive threshold allows the strategy to be forgiving *if* circumstances change, rather than being locked into a cycle of mutual defection. If the group "earns back" our trust by cooperating more, we will reciprocate.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```
// Game Parameters: n, r, k

// Internal State Variables:
threshold = 0.0  // Current adaptive threshold
last_round_cooperators = 0 // Number of cooperators in the previous round

// Initialization (before round 1)
function initialize():
    threshold = max(0.5, k / n) // Initial threshold
    last_round_cooperators = n   // Assume everyone cooperates in a hypothetical "round 0" for initial setting

// Decision function for round t (where t is current round number, 1-indexed)
function decide(t, history):
    if t == 1:
        // First round: Always cooperate
        return C
    else if t == r:
        // Last round: Always defect (no future to incentivize)
        return D
    else:
        // Get data from the previous round (t-1)
        // history is a list of lists, where history[round_num] contains actions of all players
        previous_round_actions = history[t-1]
        num_cooperators_prev = count_C_in(previous_round_actions)
        ocr_prev = num_cooperators_prev / n

        // Update threshold based on previous round's OCR
        if ocr_prev >= threshold:
            // Met or exceeded threshold: Encourage cooperation
            threshold = max(0.2, threshold - 0.05) // Slightly lower threshold, with a floor
        else:
            // Failed to meet threshold: Punish exploitation, raise bar
            threshold = min(0.9, threshold + 0.10) // Increase threshold, with a ceiling

        // Make decision based on current OCR and updated threshold
        if ocr_prev >= threshold:
            return C // Group was cooperative enough, cooperate
        else:
            return D // Group was not cooperative enough, defect

// Helper function to count cooperators
function count_C_in(actions_list):
    count = 0
    for action in actions_list:
        if action == C:
            count = count + 1
    return count

```

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Against "All D":** If all players always play D, the $OCR$ will be 0. The threshold will quickly rise to its maximum (0.9). The strategy will consistently play D, mirroring the behavior.
*   **Against "All C":** If all players always play C, the $OCR$ will be 1. The threshold will decrease towards its minimum (0.2). The strategy will consistently play C, mirroring the behavior and potentially reinforcing it.
*   **Against fluctuating behavior:** The adaptive threshold allows for gradual shifts. If a player defects for one round and then returns to cooperation, the $OCR$ might drop slightly, causing the threshold to increase modestly. If the player continues to cooperate, the threshold will decrease again. This avoids immediate, harsh punishment for minor deviations.
*   **Against sophisticated strategies:** By focusing on the aggregate outcome of the previous round rather than tracking individual players, this strategy is less susceptible to complex individualistic targeting. It rewards the group's overall cooperative effort.

This strategy provides a balance between maintaining cooperative ideals and protecting against exploitation in a repeated public goods game.

Here's a design for a cooperative, adaptive, and robust strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on natural language description and conceptual pseudocode.

## Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Threshold Cooperation (ATFT-TC)

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while also being forgiving and capable of re-establishing cooperation. It adapts to the observed behavior of the group over time.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Cooperation as the Default:** The strategy starts with cooperation, signaling a desire for mutual benefit.
2.  **Reciprocity:** It punishes defection by defecting in the next round, but only for a limited time.
3.  **Forgiveness:** It's willing to return to cooperation if others do, preventing a downward spiral of defection.
4.  **Threshold-Based Re-engagement:** It uses a threshold based on the group's past cooperation levels to decide when to attempt re-establishing full cooperation. This makes it adaptive to different opponent behaviors.
5.  **Endgame Consideration:** It accounts for the finite nature of the game to maximize its total payoff.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` depends on the following factors:

*   **Initial State:** In the first round, always Cooperate.
*   **Past Behavior (Self and Others):** The strategy monitors the *proportion of cooperators* in previous rounds.
*   **Punishment Phase:** If other players have defected recently, the strategy may defect for a limited number of rounds as a punishment.
*   **Re-engagement Threshold:** If the overall cooperation level of the group has been high, the strategy will attempt to re-establish cooperation.

**Detailed Rules:**

*   **Round 1:** Always play **C**. This signals intent and allows for early establishment of cooperative norms.

*   **For Rounds `t > 1`:**

    Let:
    *   `N_C(t-1)` be the number of players who cooperated in round `t-1`.
    *   `P_C(t-1) = N_C(t-1) / n` be the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1`.
    *   `MyAction(t-1)` be the action played by this strategy in round `t-1`.
    *   `PunishmentCounter` be a counter tracking consecutive defections by this strategy.

    **Decision Logic:**

    1.  **If `PunishmentCounter > 0`:**
        *   Decrement `PunishmentCounter` by 1.
        *   Play **D**. (Continue the punishment phase)

    2.  **Else (if `PunishmentCounter == 0`):**
        *   **If `P_C(t-1) >= CooperationThreshold`:**
            *   Play **C**. (Group cooperation is strong enough to sustain mutual cooperation)
        *   **Else (`P_C(t-1) < CooperationThreshold`):**
            *   **If `MyAction(t-1) == C`:** (Meaning this strategy cooperated in the previous round, but the group's cooperation level dropped)
                *   Play **D**. (Defect in response to a general decline in cooperation, initiating a punishment phase)
                *   Set `PunishmentCounter = PunishmentLength`.
            *   **Else (`MyAction(t-1) == D`):** (This strategy defected in the previous round, and the group's cooperation is still low)
                *   Play **D**. (Continue defecting, as the group is not yet cooperating sufficiently to justify rejoining)

*   **Last Round (`t == r`):**
    *   Regardless of past behavior, always play **D**. This is a standard grim trigger in finite games, as future cooperation cannot be reciprocated. The payoff from defecting in the last round (1) is always higher than cooperating (which would yield `(k/n) * N_C(t-1)` which is less than 1 because `k < n`).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t = 1`):**
    *   Always Cooperate (**C**). This is the foundation of building trust and signaling cooperative intent.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   Always Defect (**D**). In the final round, the incentive structure shifts. There are no future rounds to reward cooperation or punish defection. Therefore, to maximize individual payoff, defecting is the rational choice in the last round.

*   **Initial `CooperationThreshold` and `PunishmentLength`:**
    *   These parameters need to be set heuristically or tuned. For a robust strategy, we'll define them conceptually:
        *   `CooperationThreshold`: A value between 0 and 1 representing the minimum proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round required for this strategy to *consider* cooperating in the current round. A value like **0.7 or 0.8** could be a good starting point, indicating that a significant majority of players need to be cooperating.
        *   `PunishmentLength`: The number of rounds this strategy will defect *after* observing a sufficient drop in cooperation or a defection from itself. A value like **2 or 3** rounds allows for a clear signal of disapproval without permanently crippling cooperation.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The strategy is inherently cooperative in its design:

*   **Default Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating and *wants* to continue cooperating. Cooperation is the desired state.
*   **Reciprocity for Group Benefit:** The "punishment" mechanism is not for spite, but to deter selfish behavior that harms the group's overall potential payoff. By defecting when cooperation declines, it tries to steer the group back towards a mutually beneficial state.
*   **Forgiveness and Re-establishment:** The `CooperationThreshold` and the reset of `PunishmentCounter` ensure that the strategy is willing to return to cooperation as soon as the group demonstrates a sufficient level of commitment to it. It doesn't hold grudges indefinitely.
*   **Maximizing Group Potential:** While individual payoff is the ultimate goal, the strategy recognizes that sustained cooperation leads to the highest *joint* payoffs (all players receiving 2 in the all-C scenario, compared to 1 in the all-D scenario). It tries to engineer the conditions for this higher joint payoff.

### Pseudocode:

        else: // Group cooperation has dropped below threshold
            // Need to check my own previous action to know if I initiated the drop

            if len(MyHistory) > 0:
                my_last_action = MyHistory[-1]

            if my_last_action == C:
                // I cooperated, but group cooperation fell. This is unexpected.
                // Initiate punishment.
                PunishmentCounter = PunishmentLength
                return D
            else: // my_last_action == D
                // I defected previously, and group cooperation is still low. Continue defecting.
                return D

// Function to update state after each round
function update_state(my_action, num_cooperators, current_round, total_rounds):
    MyHistory.append(my_action)
    // Store data for future P_C calculations, only if not the last round to avoid issues with no next round calc
    if current_round < total_rounds:
        GroupHistory.append((num_cooperators, n))
```

This strategy is designed to be a balanced player, aiming for cooperation while having mechanisms to defend against exploitation and adapt to the collective behavior of the group. Its success will depend on the `CooperationThreshold` and `PunishmentLength` parameters and how well they are tuned to the specific tournament environment.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_57 = '''
Let's design a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game. Our focus is on achieving high collective payoffs while being resilient to various opponent behaviors.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocity with Grim Trigger"

This strategy combines elements of reciprocity and a strong deterrent against defection. It aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing deviations decisively.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core principle is to cooperate as long as the group is generally cooperating. Defection is met with a shift to a more punitive mode.

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   It's the first round.
    *   In the previous round, at least **`threshold_cooperation`** players (including yourself, if you cooperated) played C.
    *   In the previous round, if you played C, at least **`threshold_cooperation`** players (including yourself) played C.
    *   In the previous round, if you played D, at least **`threshold_cooperation`** players (including yourself, if you cooperated in the previous round) played C.

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   In the previous round, fewer than **`threshold_cooperation`** players (including yourself, if you cooperated) played C.
    *   **AND** you have defected at least once in a previous round.

*   **Special Case: Initial Defection and Grim Trigger:**
    *   If you observe that **fewer than `threshold_cooperation` players** played C in the previous round, and **you yourself played C**, you will transition to a "Grim Trigger" state.
    *   Once in the Grim Trigger state, you will **defect (D) for all subsequent rounds**, regardless of other players' actions. This serves as a strong deterrent against persistent free-riding.

**Definition of `threshold_cooperation`:**

This is a crucial parameter for adapting to the group size. We want to ensure that cooperation is "winning" for the group on average. Given the payoff function, if the total number of cooperators is less than `n/k`, the average payoff of defectors will be higher than cooperators. So, a sensible threshold would be slightly above `n/k`.

Let's set `threshold_cooperation` = `ceil(n / k) + 1`. This means we require slightly more than `n/k` cooperators for sustained cooperation. The `+1` accounts for potentially slightly imperfect information or transient dips in cooperation.

**Rationale for `threshold_cooperation`:**

*   If `total_contributions < n/k`, then `(k/n) * total_contributions < 1`. In this scenario, a defector gets 1, while a cooperator gets `(k/n) * total_contributions < 1`. So, defecting is individually rational.
*   If `total_contributions > n/k`, then `(k/n) * total_contributions > 1`. In this scenario, a cooperator gets `(k/n) * total_contributions > 1`, while a defector gets 1. Cooperating is then collectively beneficial.
*   By setting `threshold_cooperation` to `ceil(n / k) + 1`, we ensure that we are only rewarding a level of cooperation that is demonstrably better than everyone defecting, and pushing towards the point where cooperation is individually rewarding.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Always play **Cooperate (C)**. This is the default assumption of cooperation and provides an opportunity for the group to establish a cooperative norm. It's the most cooperative starting point.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   Since there are no future rounds to incentivize, the last round often becomes a "pull" to defection in standard game theory. To maintain the spirit of cooperation and contribute to the highest possible collective payoff *up to this point*, and to avoid incentivizing last-round defection in a series of *repeated games* that might be part of a larger meta-game, we will **always play Cooperate (C) in the last round.** This is a deliberate choice to prioritize the highest possible collective outcome in the final round, even if it means a slightly lower individual payoff in that specific round.

*   **Initial Defection and Grim Trigger:**
    *   As described in the decision rules, if the group's cooperation level drops below `threshold_cooperation` and you were a cooperator in that round, you enter the **Grim Trigger** state. From that point onwards, you will defect for all remaining rounds. This is a robust mechanism to punish free-riders and ensure that cooperation is not exploited without consequence.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Default to Cooperation:** The strategy starts by defaulting to cooperation, signaling a willingness to engage in the public good.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperative behavior by continuing to cooperate when the group cooperates sufficiently.
*   **Strong Deterrent, Not Malicious:** The Grim Trigger is not about seeking revenge; it's a strategic response to ensure that the cooperative effort is not consistently undermined. It aims to restore cooperation if possible, but once trust is irrevocably broken, it prioritizes preventing further exploitation.
*   **Maximizing Collective Payoff:** By aiming for sustained cooperation, the strategy implicitly aims to maximize the sum of payoffs across all players, which is the hallmark of a cooperative approach in this game.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Grim Trigger

// Game Parameters
// n: number of players
// r: number of rounds
// k: multiplication factor

// Internal State Variables
state = "NORMAL" // Can be "NORMAL" or "GRIM_TRIGGER"
last_round_cooperators = 0 // Number of players who cooperated in the previous round

// Calculate Threshold
threshold_cooperation = ceil(n / k) + 1

function decide_action(current_round, history):
  // history is a list of lists, where history[t-1] contains the actions of all players in round t-1

  if current_round == 1:
    return "C" // Always cooperate in the first round

  if current_round == r:
    return "C" // Always cooperate in the last round

  if state == "GRIM_TRIGGER":
    return "D" // Once in grim trigger, always defect

  // Analyze previous round's cooperation
  // For simplicity, assume history[current_round - 2] is the previous round's actions
  // (adjust indexing if history is structured differently)
  previous_round_actions = history[current_round - 2] // Actions from round t-1
  current_round_my_action = "D" // Default to defect if previous round was not cooperative enough

  num_cooperators_last_round = 0
  my_previous_action_was_C = False

  for player_index, action in enumerate(previous_round_actions):
    if action == "C":
      num_cooperators_last_round += 1
    if player_index == self_player_index and action == "C": // Assuming self_player_index is known
      my_previous_action_was_C = True

  // Decision logic for NORMAL state
  if num_cooperators_last_round >= threshold_cooperation:
    // Group cooperation is sufficient, continue cooperating
    current_round_my_action = "C"
  else:
    // Group cooperation is insufficient
    if my_previous_action_was_C:
      // I cooperated but the group didn't, trigger Grim Trigger
      state = "GRIM_TRIGGER"
      current_round_my_action = "D"
    else:
      // I defected or the group was already in a bad state, continue defecting
      current_round_my_action = "D"

  // Update last_round_cooperators for the next iteration (not strictly needed for this logic, but good practice)
  last_round_cooperators = num_cooperators_last_round

  return current_round_my_action
```

This strategy provides a robust and adaptive approach to the N-Player Public Goods Game, prioritizing cooperation while defending against exploitation.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_58 = '''
This strategy is designed to promote cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, while also being forgiving enough to re-establish cooperation when possible. It's a form of "grim trigger" but with a mechanism to potentially recover from widespread defection.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness (ARF)

**Core Principle:** Be cooperative by default, retaliate against defections, and attempt to forgive and re-establish cooperation after a period of collective good behavior.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision for player `i` in round `t` depends on the collective behavior of all players in the previous round `t-1`. Let:

*   `N_cooperators_t-1` be the total number of players who played 'C' in round `t-1`.
*   `N_defectors_t-1` be the total number of players who played 'D' in round `t-1`.

The decision rule for player `i` in round `t` is as follows:

*   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` >= Threshold_Cooperate:**
    *   Play **C** (Cooperate).
    *   This condition suggests that the group is generally cooperative, and it's beneficial to continue contributing to the public good.

*   **Else (If `N_cooperators_t-1` < Threshold_Cooperate):**
    *   Play **D** (Defect).
    *   This condition indicates a breakdown in cooperation, and the strategy retaliates by defecting.

*   **Forgiveness Mechanism (Conditional Cooperation):**
    *   Introduce a `Forgiveness_Counter`. This counter is reset to 0 when the strategy cooperates.
    *   If the strategy plays **D**, increment `Forgiveness_Counter`.
    *   **If `Forgiveness_Counter` reaches `Forgiveness_Limit` AND `N_cooperators_t-1` >= Threshold_Cooperate (i.e., the group *starts* to become cooperative again, but we are still in a "punishment" phase):**
        *   Revert to playing **C** (Cooperate).
        *   Reset `Forgiveness_Counter` to 0.
        *   This allows the strategy to re-engage in cooperation if it observes a return to collective good behavior, even if it was previously punishing.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** Always play **C** (Cooperate).
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative and optimistic starting point is to contribute. This sets a cooperative tone and attempts to trigger mutual cooperation.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** Always play **D** (Defect).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The dominant strategy in a one-shot game is to defect to maximize individual payoff. This strategy aims to secure individual gains at the end of the game.

*   **Edge Case: All players defect in a round (N_cooperators_t-1 = 0):**
    *   If `N_cooperators_t-1` is 0, then `N_cooperators_t-1` will certainly be less than `Threshold_Cooperate` (unless `Threshold_Cooperate` is 0, which it shouldn't be for this strategy).
    *   The strategy will play **D**.
    *   The `Forgiveness_Counter` will increment.
    *   If `N_cooperators_t-1` remains 0 for many rounds, the `Forgiveness_Counter` will likely exceed `Forgiveness_Limit`, and the strategy will continue defecting. This is the intended punishment for complete defection.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative

*   **Default Cooperation:** The strategy's initial and default behavior is to cooperate. This reflects a belief in the potential for collective good.
*   **Tit-for-Tat with a Twist:** It's similar to Tit-for-Tat in that it retaliates against defection, but it's more forgiving. It doesn't hold a grudge indefinitely.
*   **Adaptive Nature:** The `Threshold_Cooperate` and `Forgiveness_Limit` allow the strategy to adapt to the group's overall behavior. A higher `Threshold_Cooperate` requires more cooperation to sustain, while a lower one is more easily triggered. A higher `Forgiveness_Limit` means it will retaliate for longer.
*   **Punishment as Deterrent:** The defection is not purely punitive but serves as a deterrent and a signal that cooperation is required.
*   **Re-engagement:** The forgiveness mechanism is crucial for re-establishing cooperation after a period of conflict, preventing a downward spiral into perpetual defection if the environment becomes more conducive to cooperation.

---

### Parameter Tuning (for tournament implementation):

The effectiveness of this strategy will depend on the chosen values for:

*   **`Threshold_Cooperate`:** A reasonable starting point would be `n / 2`. This means that if at least half the players cooperated in the previous round, the strategy will also cooperate. A slightly higher threshold (e.g., `n * 0.6`) could be more demanding.
*   **`Forgiveness_Limit`:** This controls how long the strategy retaliates. A value of `2` or `3` rounds might be a good starting point. It means that if the group *starts* to cooperate again, and the strategy has been defecting for 2-3 rounds, it will give cooperation another try.

---

### Pseudocode

// Game Parameters
// n: number of players
// r: number of rounds
// k: multiplication factor

// Strategy Parameters (can be tuned)
Threshold_Cooperate = floor(n / 2)  // e.g., n/2
Forgiveness_Limit = 3

// State Variables (per player)
Forgiveness_Counter = 0

// --- Strategy Logic ---

Function DecideAction(current_round, all_previous_actions_history):
  // all_previous_actions_history is a list of lists, where each inner list
  // contains the actions (C or D) of all players in a given round.

  // Handle First Round
  If current_round == 1:
    Reset Forgiveness_Counter() // Ensure it's 0 for the start
    Return 'C'

  // Handle Last Round
  If current_round == r:
    Return 'D'

  // Analyze previous round's behavior
  previous_round_actions = all_previous_actions_history[current_round - 2] // 0-indexed history
  N_cooperators_prev = count of 'C' in previous_round_actions
  N_defectors_prev = count of 'D' in previous_round_actions

  // --- Decision Rules ---

  // Rule 1: High Cooperation in previous round -> Cooperate
  If N_cooperators_prev >= Threshold_Cooperate:
    Forgiveness_Counter = 0 // Reset forgiveness counter upon successful cooperation
    Return 'C'

  // Rule 2: Low Cooperation in previous round -> Defect (Retaliation)
  Else:
    // Increment forgiveness counter only when defecting
    Forgiveness_Counter = Forgiveness_Counter + 1

    // Rule 3: Forgiveness Mechanism - Re-attempt cooperation if group shows signs of it
    If Forgiveness_Counter >= Forgiveness_Limit AND N_cooperators_prev >= Threshold_Cooperate:
      Forgiveness_Counter = 0 // Reset after deciding to forgive
      Return 'C'
    Else:
      // Continue defecting if forgiveness limit not reached or group still not cooperating
      Return 'D'

End Function

// Helper to reset forgiveness counter
Function ResetForgivenessCounter():
  Forgiveness_Counter = 0
End Function

// Function to count cooperators (example)
Function CountCooperators(actions_list):
  count = 0
  For each action in actions_list:
    If action == 'C':
      count = count + 1
  Return count
End Function
```
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_59 = '''
This strategy aims to foster cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by adopting a tit-for-tat-like approach, adapted for the group dynamic, and with specific considerations for the repeated nature of the game. The core idea is to start cooperatively and then mirror the collective behavior of the group in the previous round, with a mechanism to punish defection and reward renewed cooperation.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Group Reciprocity"

This strategy seeks to achieve a high total payoff by encouraging the group to cooperate as much as possible. It is designed to be robust by reacting to the *group's* behavior rather than individual players, making it less susceptible to targeted exploitation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) for player `i` in round `t` (where `t > 1`) depends on the collective outcome of the previous round (`t-1`).

*   **If player `i` plays C in round `t`:**
    *   The total number of cooperators in round `t-1` was greater than or equal to some threshold `C_threshold`.
    *   And, player `i` played C in round `t-1`.

*   **If player `i` plays D in round `t`:**
    *   The total number of cooperators in round `t-1` was less than `C_threshold`.
    *   OR, player `i` played D in round `t-1`.

The `C_threshold` is a crucial parameter that represents the minimum level of group cooperation needed to sustain cooperation in the next round.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t = 1`):**
    *   Player `i` will **always play C** in the first round. This is the foundational cooperative gesture, setting a positive precedent.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   In the final round, the incentive to cooperate for future benefits disappears. Therefore, player `i` will **always play D** in the last round. This is a rational self-interest move in the absence of future interactions, acknowledging the finite horizon of the game.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The strategy is fundamentally cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It begins by extending an olive branch of cooperation to all players.
*   **Reciprocity (Group-Level):** It rewards sustained or sufficient group cooperation by continuing to cooperate. This incentivizes other players to maintain a cooperative environment.
*   **Punishment for Defection:** It punishes deviations from cooperation (when the group falls below the threshold) by defecting. This discourages widespread defection and helps to steer the group back towards cooperation.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The `C_threshold` can be dynamic, though for simplicity in this initial design, we will fix it. A dynamic threshold could further adapt to the overall success of cooperation over time.

### Detailed Strategy Description:

**Strategy Name:** Group Reciprocity

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: number of players
*   `r`: number of rounds
*   `k`: multiplication factor
*   `C_threshold`: A critical number of cooperators required to sustain cooperation. This value is determined by analyzing the game parameters.

**Algorithm for Player `i` in Round `t`:**

```
// Initialization
IF t == 1 THEN
    Player_i_Action = C
    RETURN Player_i_Action
END IF

// Last Round Special Case
IF t == r THEN
    Player_i_Action = D
    RETURN Player_i_Action
END IF

// Determine C_threshold
// A good initial heuristic for C_threshold:
// The minimum number of cooperators such that the average payoff per player is still beneficial if everyone cooperates.
// Payoff if all cooperate = (k/n) * n = k
// Payoff if all defect = 1
// If k > 1, cooperation is individually beneficial if everyone else cooperates.
// Consider the point where the average payoff of a cooperator equals the payoff of a defector.
// (k/n) * C_count = 1 + (k/n) * C_count (if I defect)
// This logic is tricky because it's about group average.
// A simpler heuristic: C_threshold = ceil(n / k) if k is not an integer, or related to k.
// A more robust, parameter-independent starting point:
C_threshold = floor(n / 2) + 1 // Start with a majority requirement. This can be tuned.

// Get historical data from round t-1
Total_Cooperators_Previous_Round = Count of players who played C in round t-1
Player_i_Action_Previous_Round = Player i's action in round t-1

// Decision Logic for rounds t > 1 and t < r
IF Total_Cooperators_Previous_Round >= C_threshold THEN
    // Group was sufficiently cooperative, or at least met the threshold.
    // Continue cooperating IF I also cooperated last round.
    IF Player_i_Action_Previous_Round == C THEN
        Player_i_Action = C
    ELSE
        // The group met the threshold, but I defected last round.
        // This is a subtle point: if the group hit the threshold DESPITE me defecting,
        // I should still consider cooperating to maintain the group norm.
        // However, to ensure robustness and prevent exploitation of my cooperation,
        // I'll stick to mirroring my own past behavior if the group hit the threshold.
        // This is a slight deviation from pure tit-for-tat.
        // Revisit: If group met threshold, I *should* cooperate if I want to encourage it.
        // Let's refine: If group met threshold, *I* should cooperate to encourage it,
        // regardless of my own action, to reinforce the positive group behavior.
        Player_i_Action = C // Encourage group cooperation
    END IF
ELSE
    // Group did not meet the cooperation threshold.
    // This implies defection was prevalent or beneficial in the last round.
    // Punish by defecting.
    Player_i_Action = D
END IF

RETURN Player_i_Action
```

### Refined Decision Logic for Rounds `t > 1` and `t < r`:

Let's simplify the logic for `t > 1` and `t < r` to be more purely "group-reciprocity" based:

```
// Get historical data from round t-1
Total_Cooperators_Previous_Round = Count of players who played C in round t-1

// Determine C_threshold
// Heuristic: For cooperation to be sustainable, the average payoff for a cooperator
// should be at least as good as a defector, assuming a certain level of cooperation.
// The condition k > 1 is key.
// If k/n * C_count > 1, cooperation is potentially profitable.
// Let's set C_threshold to be the minimum number of cooperators that makes the average payoff for a cooperator
// strictly greater than the payoff for a defector, assuming C_count cooperators.
// This means (k/n) * C_count > 1.
// So, C_threshold = floor(n/k) + 1. If k is an integer and k < n, this is a reasonable starting point.
// Example: n=6, k=2. C_threshold = floor(6/2) + 1 = 4.
// If 4 players cooperate:
//   Cooperator payoff: (1-1) + (2/6)*4 = 8/6 = 1.33
//   Defector payoff: (1-0) + (2/6)*4 = 1 + 8/6 = 2.33
// This calculation shows my initial heuristic for C_threshold might be too low.
// The payoff for a defector when there are C cooperators is 1 + (k/n)*C.
// The payoff for a cooperator when there are C cooperators is (k/n)*C.
// For cooperation to be "good" on average for the group, we want the total payoff to be higher than if everyone defected.
// Total payoff if C cooperators: C * (k/n)*C + (n-C)*1
// Total payoff if all defect: n * 1
// We want: C*(k/n)*C + n - C > n  => C*(k/n)*C - C > 0 => C * (k/n)*C - 1 > 0. This is not helpful.

// Let's revert to a simpler, more robust approach for C_threshold:
// A common strategy in repeated games is to punish deviations from a mutually beneficial outcome.
// The outcome where all cooperate gives a payoff of k for everyone.
// The outcome where all defect gives a payoff of 1 for everyone.
// Since k > 1, mutual cooperation is better.
// The condition for cooperation to be locally stable (no single player wants to deviate) is when
// the marginal benefit of contributing equals the marginal cost.
// Marginal benefit of one more cooperator for player i: k/n.
// Marginal cost of contributing for player i: 1 (foregone endowment).
// So, if k/n > 1, cooperation is tempting. But k < n, so k/n < 1.
// This means cooperation is NOT individually rational in a one-shot game.

// The key is the repeated nature. Let's consider when the *group* average payoff is maximized.
// This happens with full cooperation.
// The Nash Equilibrium in a single round is likely all defect.
// For repeated games, we need a threshold where the *threat* of defection is sufficient to deter defection.

// Re-evaluating C_threshold:
// Let's set C_threshold to be the smallest number of cooperators that ensures that the
// average payoff across ALL players (cooperators and defectors) is GREATER than if everyone defected.
// Average payoff with C cooperators: (C * (k/n)*C + (n-C)*1) / n
// We want: (C * (k/n)*C + n - C) / n > 1
// C * (k/n)*C + n - C > n
// C * (k/n)*C - C > 0
// C * (k/n * C - 1) > 0
// Since C > 0, we need k/n * C - 1 > 0 => k/n * C > 1 => C > n/k.
// So, C_threshold = floor(n/k) + 1. Let's use this.
// For n=6, k=2: C_threshold = floor(6/2) + 1 = 4.
// If 4 cooperate:
//   Cooperator payoff: (2/6) * 4 = 8/6 = 1.33
//   Defector payoff: 1 + (2/6) * 4 = 1 + 8/6 = 2.33
// So, if 4 cooperate, defectors get more. This threshold isn't quite right for individual incentives.

// The core idea of Group Reciprocity should be:
// - If the group was cooperative enough (met C_threshold), I will be cooperative.
// - If the group was not cooperative enough, I will defect.

// Revised C_threshold determination:
// Let's set C_threshold to be the number of cooperators such that cooperating is the best response for *at least* half the players.

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Robustness:** The strategy is robust because it doesn't rely on predicting individual player behavior. It reacts to the emergent group behavior. If a majority consistently defects, the strategy will defect, minimizing losses. If a majority consistently cooperates, the strategy will contribute to sustaining that cooperation.
*   **Adaptability:** The `cooperation_threshold` acts as an adaptive mechanism. If the game dynamics lead to a high level of cooperation, the strategy will continue to cooperate. If the dynamics lead to low cooperation, it will reciprocate with defection. The strategy adapts to the prevailing norm within the group.

This "Group Reciprocity" strategy provides a strong foundation for cooperative play in a repeated N-Player Public Goods Game, balancing the desire for collective gain with the necessity of protecting oneself from exploitation.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_60 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocity with Punishment Threshold

**Core Philosophy:** This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and deterring defection through a measured response. It balances the desire for high collective payoffs with self-preservation against exploitative behavior.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of this strategy is conditional cooperation. We will cooperate as long as the group's cooperative behavior remains sufficiently high. If defection becomes too prevalent, we will defect to protect our own endowment.

**Decision Rule:**

*   **If (Total number of cooperators in the previous round) / n >= Threshold_Cooperation:**
    *   **Play C (Cooperate)**
*   **Else:**
    *   **Play D (Defect)**

**Explanation of Terms:**

*   **Threshold_Cooperation:** This is a dynamic parameter that represents the minimum proportion of players required to cooperate in the previous round for us to continue cooperating. It will be set based on the game parameters and evolve over time. A good starting point would be `k/n`, as this is the point where cooperation breaks even for an individual player.

**Adaptive Element:** The `Threshold_Cooperation` is not static. It will adjust based on the observed behavior of other players.

*   **Increasing Threshold:** If the group's cooperation rate dips below our current threshold and we defect, but the cooperation rate *still* doesn't recover in the subsequent round (even with our defection), we might slightly *increase* the `Threshold_Cooperation` in the *next* round. This signifies that we require even stronger evidence of collective commitment to cooperate.
*   **Decreasing Threshold:** Conversely, if the group maintains a high cooperation rate (above our current threshold), we might slightly *decrease* the `Threshold_Cooperation` in the *next* round. This rewards sustained cooperation and encourages it to become the norm.

**Initial Threshold:** For the first round, we will always cooperate. After the first round, we will set `Threshold_Cooperation` to `k/n`.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**First Round (t=1):**

*   **Decision:** Always play **C (Cooperate)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any historical information, initiating cooperation is the most cooperative stance. It provides an opportunity for the group to establish a cooperative norm from the outset. This is a gamble on others also being cooperative, but it's the most aligned with the strategy's cooperative objective.

**Last Round (t=r):**

*   **Decision:** Always play **D (Defect)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. Any cooperation in this round would simply benefit other players without any reciprocal benefit for us in subsequent rounds. Therefore, to maximize our own payoff, we defect. This is a standard backward induction argument in finitely repeated games.

**Other Rounds (1 < t < r):**

*   **Decision:** Apply the main **Decision Rule** described above.
    *   **Rationale:** For all intermediate rounds, the adaptive reciprocity mechanism is in full effect. We cooperate based on the observed group behavior and adjust our threshold accordingly.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative by nature.

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating, signaling a willingness to engage in collective benefit.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** It rewards continued cooperation from others by continuing to cooperate and makes the cooperative threshold more achievable.
*   **Punishment is Restorative, Not Retaliatory:** When defection occurs, the strategy does not engage in endless cycles of retaliation. It defects for a round (or potentially more if cooperation doesn't rebound) to signal disapproval and incentivize a return to cooperation. The punishment is temporary and conditional on the group's ability to self-correct.
*   **Focus on Collective Gain:** The strategy's ultimate goal is to maximize the total payoff for the group, as a high level of cooperation leads to higher individual payoffs for everyone (as long as `k > 1`).

```

**Note on Threshold Adaptation:** The specific rates (0.99, 1.01) for adjusting `threshold_cooperation` are tunable parameters. More complex adaptive rules could be employed, such as looking at the trend of cooperation over multiple rounds, or reacting more strongly to a complete collapse of cooperation. The goal is to be sensitive to changes but not overly reactive to single-round anomalies. The `max(k/n, ...)` and `min(1.0, ...)` ensure the threshold stays within reasonable bounds.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_61 = '''
This is a fascinating N-player Public Goods Game, and designing a cooperative strategy that is adaptive and robust is a key challenge. The tension lies between the individual incentive to defect (as the private payoff is always higher when others cooperate) and the collective benefit of cooperation (which leads to a higher total payoff for everyone).

Here's a strategy designed to promote cooperation while being resilient to defection, focusing on a tit-for-tat-like approach adapted for a multi-player environment.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Echo"

The "Adaptive Echo" strategy aims to reward cooperation and punish defection, gradually learning from the collective behavior of the group. It's rooted in the idea that sustainable cooperation emerges when players can signal their willingness to cooperate and retaliate against those who exploit it.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Initial Generosity:** Start by cooperating to signal a willingness to engage in the public good.
2.  **Reciprocity:** Mirror the group's cooperation levels. If the group cooperates more, we cooperate more. If the group defects more, we defect more.
3.  **Punishment and Forgiveness:** Defect strategically when the group's cooperation drops significantly, but be willing to return to cooperation if the group's behavior improves.
4.  **End-Game Caution:** Be mindful of the last round where there's no future incentive to cooperate.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` depends on the *average cooperation rate* of the *entire group* in the *previous round* (`t-1`).

Let:
*   `avg_coop_rate_t-1` = (Total number of cooperators in round `t-1`) / `n`

We will define thresholds based on this average cooperation rate. The exact values of these thresholds are crucial for balancing cooperativeness with robustness. For now, let's define them conceptually:

*   **Threshold 1 (High Cooperation):** `T_high`
*   **Threshold 2 (Moderate Cooperation):** `T_mid`

**Decision Logic for Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

*   **If `avg_coop_rate_t-1` ≥ `T_high`:** Play **C** (Cooperate). The group is largely cooperating, so we should too.
*   **If `T_mid` ≤ `avg_coop_rate_t-1` < `T_high`:** Play **C** (Cooperate). The group is still cooperating at a decent level.
*   **If `avg_coop_rate_t-1` < `T_mid`:** Play **D** (Defect). The group's cooperation has fallen below a sustainable level, indicating exploitation. We need to signal our displeasure and protect our endowment.

**Tuning the Thresholds (`T_high` and `T_mid`):**

These thresholds are key to the strategy's adaptiveness. They should be dynamic or carefully chosen.

*   **Initial thought on fixed thresholds (for implementation, these would need tuning):**
    *   `T_high` could be, for example, 75% of players cooperating (e.g., `0.75`).
    *   `T_mid` could be, for example, 40% of players cooperating (e.g., `0.40`).

    The exact values will determine how quickly the strategy reacts to changes. A lower `T_mid` makes it more forgiving, while a higher `T_mid` makes it more sensitive to defection.

**How the thresholds align with cooperation:** The strategy is fundamentally cooperative. It *prefers* to cooperate. It only defects when the *observed behavior of others* indicates that widespread defection is the norm, making our cooperation unsustainable and leading to a lower payoff for us. This isn't aggressive defection; it's a defensive measure to prevent consistent exploitation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (The First Round):**
    *   **Decision:** Always play **C** (Cooperate).
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, we must initiate cooperation. This sets a positive tone and allows us to gauge the initial behavior of the group. There's no information to base a defect decision on.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always play **D** (Defect).
    *   **Rationale:** This is a crucial adaptation for repeated games. In the final round, there is no future round to incentivize cooperation. Any cooperation in the last round is purely altruistic from an individual payoff perspective, as it doesn't influence future actions. The dominant strategy for rational players in the last round is to defect. To maximize our total payoff over `r` rounds, we must defect in the final round, as no one else's future behavior will be affected. This is a concession to the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of the last round.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The "Adaptive Echo" strategy is designed to be cooperative in spirit and effect:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating, providing the initial "trust" for a cooperative outcome.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the group's average cooperation rate remains above the defined thresholds, effectively rewarding collective cooperation.
*   **Retaliates Proportionally:** It only defects when the group's cooperation level drops significantly, indicating a tendency towards exploitation. This isn't punitive, but rather a responsive mechanism to prevent being taken advantage of. The defection is temporary and aims to push the group back towards a more cooperative state in future rounds.
*   **Learns and Adapts:** The strategy's reliance on the group's past behavior makes it adaptive. If the group spontaneously moves towards higher cooperation, this strategy will follow. If the group consistently defects, this strategy will eventually also defect, but only after observing sustained defection from others.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```python
# Global variables (or state maintained per game instance)
total_rounds = r
current_round = 1
history = [] # List of dictionaries, each representing a round's actions: [{'player_id': '1', 'action': 'C'}, ...]

# Strategy parameters (these would be tuned)
T_high = 0.75 # e.g., 75% cooperation
T_mid = 0.40  # e.g., 40% cooperation

def decide_action(player_id, game_parameters, round_history_so_far):
    n = game_parameters['n']
    r = game_parameters['r']

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C' # Always cooperate in the first round

    if current_round == r:
        return 'D' # Always defect in the last round

    # Calculate average cooperation rate from the previous round
    previous_round_actions = round_history_so_far.get(current_round - 1, [])
    if not previous_round_actions:
        # Should not happen if round_history_so_far is populated correctly,
        # but as a fallback, if no data from previous round, cooperate.
        return 'C'

    cooperators_in_previous_round = sum(1 for action_data in previous_round_actions if action_data['action'] == 'C')
    avg_coop_rate_prev = cooperators_in_previous_round / n

    # Decision rules based on average cooperation rate
    if avg_coop_rate_prev >= T_high:
        return 'C'
    elif avg_coop_rate_prev >= T_mid:
        return 'C'
    else: # avg_coop_rate_prev < T_mid
        return 'D'

# --- In the tournament management system ---
# This function would be called for each player in each round
# 'round_history_so_far' would be a structure mapping round numbers to lists of player actions.
# Example: {1: [{'player_id': '1', 'action': 'C'}, {'player_id': '2', 'action': 'C'}], ...}
```

### Robustness and Adaptiveness:

*   **Robustness to Defection:** If other players defect, their collective defection will drive down `avg_coop_rate_t-1`. This strategy will eventually mirror their defection when `avg_coop_rate_t-1` falls below `T_mid`, thus protecting its own payoff. It won't be an easy target.
*   **Adaptiveness to Cooperation:** If other players, through their own strategies, manage to stabilize a high level of cooperation, this strategy will happily continue cooperating, maximizing the shared benefits. It doesn't get "stuck" defecting.
*   **Handles Mixed Strategies:** It can handle opponents who play a mix of C and D. The average cooperation rate will reflect this mix, and the strategy will react accordingly.
*   **No Pre-programmed Coordination:** It doesn't assume anyone will cooperate on a schedule or follow a pattern. It reacts solely to the *observed outcomes* of collective actions.

This "Adaptive Echo" strategy offers a balanced approach, aiming for the high payoffs of sustained cooperation while having a built-in mechanism to protect against exploitation. The key to its success in a tournament will be careful tuning of the `T_high` and `T_mid` parameters.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_62 = '''
Here's a design for a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptiveness and robustness:

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while also being forgiving and capable of re-establishing cooperation. It learns from past behavior and adapts its approach based on the collective actions of the group.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of ATFT is its conditional cooperation. It evaluates the "state of the world" based on the recent history of the game and makes its decision accordingly.

*   **Default Action:** In the absence of strong evidence to defect, the default action is **Cooperate (C)**. This reflects the cooperative intent.

*   **Trigger for Defection:** The strategy will defect (**D**) if it observes a **significant decline in cooperation** or a **consistent pattern of defection**. Specifically:
    *   **Threshold-Based Defection:** If the proportion of players who cooperated in the *previous round* falls below a certain adaptive threshold.
    *   **Persistence of Defection:** If a player (including itself, if it defected in the previous round) has defected for a consecutive number of rounds, ATFT will also defect. This provides a strong disincentive for sustained defection.

*   **Trigger for Re-cooperation:** The strategy aims to return to cooperation if the environment becomes more favorable.
    *   **Recovery of Cooperation:** If the proportion of cooperators in the group increases significantly after a period of defection.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

The strategy incorporates specific rules for the beginning and end of the game to manage the inherent uncertainties.

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action: Cooperate (C)**. The first round is a leap of faith. By cooperating, ATFT signals its cooperative intent and provides an opportunity for mutual cooperation to emerge. This is the most cooperative starting point.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**. In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The dominant strategy in a one-shot game is to defect to maximize individual payoff, as there's no incentive to maintain cooperation for future rounds. ATFT adheres to this game-theoretic prediction to avoid being exploited in the final interaction.

*   **Penultimate Round (t=r-1):**
    *   **Action: Consider the current state and the knowledge of the last round.** If cooperation has been high in the current round (t=r-1), ATFT will still cooperate, hoping to incentivize cooperation even in the last round (though it knows this is unlikely to be reciprocated). If defection has been prevalent, it will also defect. This is a more nuanced approach than simply defecting.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The cooperative spirit is embedded throughout the strategy:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** Starting with 'C' is a clear signal of cooperative intent.
*   **Forgiveness:** The strategy is designed to be forgiving. If a defection occurs, it doesn't immediately escalate to perpetual defection. It assesses the situation and can re-establish cooperation if conditions improve.
*   **Proportionate Response:** The strategy's defection is triggered by collective behavior, not just a single instance of defection. This means it's less likely to retaliate aggressively against minor deviations from cooperation.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** The thresholds for defection and re-cooperation are not fixed. They are dynamic and adapt to the observed behavior of the group. This allows ATFT to adjust to different levels of collective cooperation.

//   observe all players' actions_in_round
//   update_history(t, actions_in_round)
//   update internal state variables (e.g., my_previous_action)
```

### Robustness and Adaptiveness Explanation:

*   **Robustness:**
    *   **To exploitation:** The `defection_persistence_count` acts as a deterrent. If a player consistently defects, the group (and thus ATFT) will retaliate by defecting.
    *   **To noise:** The thresholds (`defection_threshold`, `re_cooperation_threshold`) are not set at 100% or 0%. This allows for some fluctuation in player behavior without immediate drastic reactions.
    *   **To different player types:** ATFT doesn't assume other players are rational egoists or pure cooperators. It observes their behavior and adjusts.

*   **Adaptiveness:**
    *   **Dynamic Thresholds (Implicit):** While the pseudocode shows fixed thresholds, in a more advanced implementation, these could be learned and adjusted over time based on the overall success of the strategy in achieving higher total payoffs.
    *   **Reactive to group behavior:** The core of ATFT is its reaction to the collective actions of the group, making it adaptable to the prevailing social norm within the game.
    *   **Learns from history:** The `history` variable allows the strategy to build a memory of past interactions, crucial for repeated games.

This strategy aims to be a strong contender by balancing a cooperative disposition with a pragmatic understanding of game theory and the need to protect against exploitation.

Here's a design for a cooperative strategy in the N-Player Public Goods Game, focused on adaptability and robustness:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by starting cooperatively and rewarding cooperative behavior while punishing defection. However, it incorporates a degree of forgiveness to avoid a complete descent into mutual defection if initial cooperation is met with some defections.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of this strategy relies on monitoring the overall level of cooperation in previous rounds and adjusting behavior accordingly.

*   **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating (playing 'C') in the first round. This signals a commitment to cooperation and provides an opportunity for mutual benefit.

*   **Conditional Cooperation:** In subsequent rounds (t > 1), my decision to play 'C' or 'D' depends on the observed behavior of other players in the *previous* round (t-1).
    *   **High Cooperation:** If the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round was above a certain threshold, I will cooperate ('C') in the current round.
    *   **Low Cooperation:** If the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round fell below a certain threshold, I will defect ('D') in the current round.
    *   **Ambiguous Cooperation:** If the proportion of cooperators is between the "high" and "low" thresholds, I will revert to cooperating ('C'). This is the "forgiveness" aspect – a minor dip in cooperation doesn't immediately trigger perpetual defection.

*   **Punishment Phase:** If a player has defected against me (i.e., played 'D' when I played 'C') in the previous round, I will defect ('D') against *that specific player* in the current round, regardless of the overall cooperation level. This is a targeted punishment to discourage individual defection. However, I will still play based on the overall cooperation level against other players.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always play 'C'. This is the initial commitment to cooperation.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the last round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. Therefore, the rational choice is to maximize immediate individual gain. This means playing 'D' in the final round, regardless of past history. This is a standard grim trigger strategy adjustment for the end of a repeated game.

*   **Last Second Round (t=r-1):** Since the last round will be defection, players might anticipate this. To counteract this, in the second-to-last round, I will also defect ('D'). This is a backward induction adjustment for the final round.

*   **Initial Rounds (Early t < r-2):** For the early rounds, the strategy will heavily rely on the observed cooperation levels. The thresholds for "high" and "low" cooperation will be crucial here.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The core philosophy of this strategy is to be cooperative by default. We start by extending the hand of cooperation and aim to build a mutually beneficial environment.

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** We initiate cooperation in the first round, offering the potential for the highest collective payoff.
*   **Responsive Cooperation:** We continue to cooperate as long as others are also contributing to the public good. This creates a positive feedback loop for cooperation.
*   **Forgiveness:** The strategy doesn't immediately punish minor lapses in cooperation. It allows for fluctuations and aims to pull the group back towards cooperation rather than triggering a race to the bottom.
*   **Targeted Punishment:** While aiming for cooperation, the strategy is not naive. It includes a mechanism to punish persistent individual defectors to protect the cooperative environment.

### Thresholds and Parameters

To implement "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness," we need to define the thresholds for "high" and "low" cooperation. These could be set as proportions of players:

*   **`cooperation_threshold_high`:** If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round is `>= cooperation_threshold_high`, I will cooperate. A reasonable starting point could be **`0.6`** (60% of players cooperating).
*   **`cooperation_threshold_low`:** If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round is `< cooperation_threshold_low`, I will defect. A reasonable starting point could be **`0.4`** (40% of players cooperating).

The range between `cooperation_threshold_low` and `cooperation_threshold_high` represents the "ambiguous" zone where the strategy defaults to cooperation.

### Pseudocode

```
// Strategy: Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness

// Global parameters (from game specification): n, r, k

// Strategy-specific parameters:
// cooperation_threshold_high = 0.6  // Example value
// cooperation_threshold_low = 0.4   // Example value

// History variables:
// previous_round_actions: A list of actions taken by all players in the previous round
// my_previous_action: My action in the previous round

// Decision function for round 't' (current round)

    if t == r - 1:
        return 'D' // Defect in the second to last round due to backward induction

    // Handle first round
    if t == 1:
        return 'C' // Start by cooperating

    // --- Subsequent Rounds (1 < t < r-1) ---

    // Calculate the total number of cooperators in the previous round
    num_cooperators_previous_round = count('C' in previous_round_actions)
    proportion_cooperators_previous_round = num_cooperators_previous_round / n

    // Check for individual defection against me in the previous round
    individual_defection_against_me = false
    for i from 1 to n:
        if i is not me: // Assuming we can identify opponents
            if opponent_actions_in_previous_round[i] == 'D' and my_previous_action == 'C':
                individual_defection_against_me = true
                break // Found one instance, no need to check further

    // Decision logic
    if individual_defection_against_me:
        return 'D' // Punish individual defection
    else:
        if proportion_cooperators_previous_round >= cooperation_threshold_high:
            return 'C' // High cooperation: continue cooperating
        elif proportion_cooperators_previous_round < cooperation_threshold_low:
            return 'D' // Low cooperation: defect to punish
        else:
            return 'C' // Ambiguous cooperation: forgive and cooperate

```

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

*   **`t`**: The current round number.
*   **`previous_round_actions`**: This would be a data structure that stores the action of each player from round `t-1`. For example, a list or array of strings.
*   **`my_previous_action`**: My action in round `t-1`.
*   **`opponent_actions_in_previous_round`**: This is a more detailed history. If we can identify and track individual opponents, this would store their specific action from `t-1`.
*   **`count('C' in previous_round_actions)`**: This function would count how many players played 'C' in the `previous_round_actions`.
*   **`num_cooperators_previous_round / n`**: Calculates the proportion of cooperators.
*   **`individual_defection_against_me`**: A boolean flag. This part of the logic assumes we can distinguish between our own action and the actions of others. In a tournament setting, this might be implicitly handled by the game engine providing a history of all actions for each player. If not, this feature might need to be simplified to just reacting to the overall proportion of defectors.

This strategy is designed to be adaptable by responding to the collective behavior of the group and robust by having mechanisms to handle both low participation and direct defection. Its cooperative nature is evident in its default to cooperation and its forgiveness of temporary dips in group contribution.

description_COOPERATIVE_64 = '''
Here's a design for a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, aiming for adaptiveness and robustness in a tournament setting:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Tit-for-Tat with a Cooperative Bias and Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by starting cooperatively, reciprocating opponents' actions, but also incorporating a mechanism to encourage the return to cooperation after periods of defection. It prioritizes collective gain while mitigating the risks of exploitation.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Start Cooperative:** Assume other players are also seeking to maximize collective payoff and begin with cooperation.
*   **Reciprocate:** Punish defection by defecting, and reward cooperation by cooperating.
*   **Forgive and Re-engage:** Don't hold grudges indefinitely. If a player returns to cooperation after defecting, be willing to cooperate again.
*   **Exploit the "K" Advantage:** Recognize that when cooperation is high, the collective payoff is significantly amplified.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of the strategy revolves around the observed behavior of *other* players. We'll track the proportion of cooperators in previous rounds.

**General Rule (for rounds t > 1):**

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   The average contribution of all *other* players in the *previous* round (t-1) was greater than or equal to a certain threshold. This threshold is designed to reflect a sufficient level of cooperation to justify continuing to cooperate.
    *   **AND** the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round (t-1) was at least one player. This prevents perpetual cooperation if everyone defects.

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   The average contribution of all *other* players in the *previous* round (t-1) was less than the defined threshold. This acts as a punishment for insufficient collective cooperation.

**Threshold Calculation:**

The threshold is crucial. It needs to be adaptive and reflect the game's parameters. A sensible threshold would be a proportion of players that ensures a positive average payoff from cooperation, even if some players defect.

Let's define the "average opponent cooperation proportion" in round `t-1` as:

`AvgOpponentCoop_t-1 = (Total Cooperators in round t-1 - c_i,t-1) / (n - 1)`

Where `c_i,t-1` is player `i`'s action in round `t-1` (1 for C, 0 for D).

**Decision Rule Refined:**

*   **Play C in round `t` if:**
    *   `AvgOpponentCoop_t-1` >= `CoopThreshold`
    *   **OR** if this is the very first round (see edge cases).

*   **Play D in round `t` if:**
    *   `AvgOpponentCoop_t-1` < `CoopThreshold`
    *   **AND** this is NOT the very first round.

**What is `CoopThreshold`?**

This threshold is key to our strategy's cooperativeness and adaptiveness. It should ensure that cooperation is beneficial for the collective. A reasonable starting point for `CoopThreshold` could be:

`CoopThreshold = (1 / k)`

**Rationale for `CoopThreshold = (1/k)`:**

If `1/k` of the players cooperate, the total contribution is `n/k`. The share of public good per player is `(k/n) * (n/k) = 1`. This means each cooperator effectively gets their endowment back from the public good, and defectors get their endowment plus their share of the public good. If more than `1/k` cooperate, cooperation becomes mutually beneficial on average. For example, if `k=2` and `n=6`, `CoopThreshold = 1/2`. If half the players cooperate, the public good share is `(2/6) * 3 = 1`. A cooperator gets `0 + 1 = 1` and a defector gets `1 + 1 = 2`. If more than half cooperate, say 4 players, then `(2/6) * 4 = 4/3`. Cooperators get `0 + 4/3` and defectors get `1 + 4/3`. The average payoff increases with more cooperators.

**Important Adjustment to Threshold:**

To be more forgiving, we can introduce a *slightly lower* threshold for *returning* to cooperation after a defection, compared to the threshold for *initiating* cooperation.

Let's introduce two thresholds:

1.  **`InitiateCoopThreshold` (for initiating cooperation):** This will be our primary `CoopThreshold = (1 / k)`.
2.  **`ReturnCoopThreshold` (for returning to cooperation after defecting):** This will be slightly lower, e.g., `ReturnCoopThreshold = max(0, (1 / k) - 0.1)` or a fixed small number of players, ensuring we don't get stuck in defection too easily.

**Decision Rule with Forgiveness:**

*   **Play C in round `t` if:**
    *   (This is the first round) **OR**
    *   (The average cooperation proportion of *other* players in round `t-1` was >= `InitiateCoopThreshold`) **OR**
    *   (We defected in round `t-1` **AND** the average cooperation proportion of *other* players in round `t-1` was >= `ReturnCoopThreshold`)

*   **Play D in round `t` if:**
    *   (This is NOT the first round) **AND**
    *   (We did NOT defect in round `t-1` **AND** average opponent cooperation proportion in `t-1` < `InitiateCoopThreshold`) **OR**
    *   (We defected in round `t-1` **AND** average opponent cooperation proportion in `t-1` < `ReturnCoopThreshold`)

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Always Cooperate (C).** This is our cooperative starting point. We assume that other rational players will also start cooperatively or at least be open to it.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** In the absence of future interactions, the incentive to cooperate diminishes. The last round becomes a one-shot game where defecting is the dominant strategy. This is a standard assumption for the end of repeated games.

*   **All Players Defect in the Previous Round:**
    *   If `n` players defected in round `t-1`, the `AvgOpponentCoop_t-1` will be 0. This will trigger defection in round `t` based on our rules (unless it's the first round). However, our forgiveness mechanism will only allow a return to cooperation if the *average* opponent cooperation reaches `ReturnCoopThreshold`. If the entire group is stuck in defection, this strategy will continue to defect.

*   **What if `k` is very close to 1?**
    *   The strategy remains the same. The `CoopThreshold` will be higher, demanding more cooperation to sustain it.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative due to:

*   **The initial act of cooperation in Round 1:** It sets a positive tone.
*   **The `InitiateCoopThreshold`:** It requires a significant level of collective cooperation to continue reciprocating cooperation. This means we are not just blindly cooperating, but seeking a demonstrably beneficial collective outcome.
*   **The `ReturnCoopThreshold`:** This is the "forgiveness" aspect. It allows for the possibility of re-establishing cooperation even if there was a lapse, as long as the opponent shows sufficient willingness to return to a cooperative state. This prevents getting locked into a mutually destructive cycle of defection.
*   **Adaptive Nature:** The strategy responds to the environment. If others are cooperative, it rewards them. If they defect, it punishes, but not irrevocably.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
Strategy_TitForTatCoopBiasForgiveness(player_id, n, r, k, history):
    # history is a list of lists, where history[t] is a list of actions of all players in round t.
    # actions are 'C' or 'D'.

        return 'D'  # Always defect in the last round

    # --- Calculate Previous Round's Opponent Cooperation ---
    previous_round_actions = history[current_round - 2] # Get actions from the round before last
    my_previous_action = previous_round_actions[player_id] # Assuming player_id is 0-indexed

    total_cooperators_prev_round = previous_round_actions.count('C')
    other_players_count = n - 1

    if other_players_count == 0: # Should not happen if n >= 2
        return 'D' # Fallback, though unlikely

    average_opponent_coop_prev_round = (total_cooperators_prev_round - (1 if my_previous_action == 'C' else 0)) / other_players_count

    # --- Define Thresholds ---
    initiate_coop_threshold = 1.0 / k
    # Forgiveness: Slightly lower threshold to re-enter cooperation
    return_coop_threshold = max(0.0, (1.0 / k) - 0.1)

    # --- Decision Logic ---
    if my_previous_action == 'C':
        # If I cooperated last round, I'll continue if opponents were sufficiently cooperative
        if average_opponent_coop_prev_round >= initiate_coop_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'
    else: # I defected last round
        # If I defected last round, I will return to cooperation if opponents were sufficiently cooperative (using forgiveness threshold)
        if average_opponent_coop_prev_round >= return_coop_threshold:
            return 'C'
        else:
            return 'D'

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Variables:**

*   `player_id`: The index of our player (e.g., 0 to n-1).
*   `n`: Number of players.
*   `r`: Number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplication factor.
*   `history`: A list where `history[t]` contains a list of actions taken by all players in round `t` (where `t` is 0-indexed).
*   `current_round`: The round we are currently deciding for (1-indexed).
*   `previous_round_actions`: The actions taken by all players in the round *before* the current one.
*   `my_previous_action`: The action *our* player took in the previous round.
*   `total_cooperators_prev_round`: The total count of players who played 'C' in the previous round.
*   `other_players_count`: The number of players excluding ourselves.
*   `average_opponent_coop_prev_round`: The calculated average cooperation rate among *other* players in the previous round.
*   `initiate_coop_threshold`: The threshold for continuing cooperation when we previously cooperated.
*   `return_coop_threshold`: The slightly lower threshold for returning to cooperation after we previously defected.

This strategy is designed to be robust by reacting to observed behavior while maintaining a strong cooperative inclination. Its adaptability comes from its reliance on historical data and its flexible thresholds.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_65 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Reciprocity with a Grace Period"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a built-in forgiveness mechanism and a clear understanding of the game's finite nature. It's built on the principle of "I'll cooperate if you cooperate, but I'll teach you a lesson if you don't, and eventually, we'll just do what's best for ourselves given the end is near."

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of this strategy revolves around observing the behavior of the *average* player. This helps to avoid being overly punished by a single defector and rewards widespread cooperation.

*   **Initial Cooperation (Grace Period):** In the initial rounds, we will always cooperate. This allows us to explore the possibility of achieving the higher payoff from mutual cooperation. The length of this grace period is a crucial parameter.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** After the grace period, our decision to cooperate or defect depends on the observed average behavior of other players in the *previous* round.
    *   **Cooperate (C) if:** The proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round was *above* a certain threshold.
    *   **Defect (D) if:** The proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round was *at or below* that threshold.

The specific threshold for cooperation is linked to the game parameters:

*   **Cooperate if (Average Cooperation Rate > k/n)**
    *   **Rationale:**  This threshold represents the point where collective cooperation is at least as beneficial (or more so) than the average individual return from defecting. If the average contribution per player leads to a share of the public good that is *greater* than what a defector keeps (which is 1), then collective cooperation is the dominant strategy for the group. If the average cooperation rate falls below this, it suggests that the collective benefit of cooperation is not being realized, making individual defection more rational.

*   **Defect (D) if (Average Cooperation Rate ≤ k/n)**
    *   **Rationale:** If the average player is not contributing enough to make collective cooperation beneficial for everyone, then defecting becomes the individually rational choice to maximize one's own payoff.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Always Cooperate (C).** This is the start of the grace period. The goal is to set a cooperative tone and see if others reciprocate.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The game becomes a one-shot game, and in the one-shot Public Goods Game, defecting is the Nash Equilibrium. This ensures we maximize our payoff in the absence of future interactions.

*   **Penultimate Round (t = r-1):**
    *   **Apply the conditional cooperation rule.** Observe the average cooperation rate in round `r-2` and decide based on the `k/n` threshold. This allows for a response to behavior leading up to the final defection round.

*   **Grace Period:**
    *   The grace period will last for a fixed number of rounds. A reasonable choice would be `min(r/4, 5)` rounds. This ensures a sufficient exploration phase, especially in longer games, but is also capped to prevent excessive initial cooperation in very short games. The exact number can be fine-tuned. For example, in a 20-round game, it might be 5 rounds. In a 10-round game, it might be 2-3 rounds.

*   **Dealing with a Single Defector:**
    *   The strategy focuses on the *average* cooperation rate. This inherently provides robustness against isolated defectors. If only one player defects, and the rest cooperate, the average cooperation rate will remain high, and we will continue to cooperate. We only defect if the *overall* cooperation level drops below the threshold.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its intent:

*   **Initial Trust:** We start by assuming the best and cooperating, signaling a desire for mutual benefit.
*   **Reciprocity:** We reward cooperative behavior by continuing to cooperate when the group benefits from it.
*   **Punishment for Group Defection:** We defect when the group's overall behavior makes cooperation detrimental to individual payoffs, signaling that such behavior is unsustainable. This is not malicious; it's a rational response to a breakdown of collective action.
*   **Adaptive:** It adjusts its behavior based on observed outcomes, making it resilient to a variety of opponent strategies.
*   **Goal Alignment:** The strategy aims to achieve the highest possible payoff for itself, which in this game, is often achieved through sustained cooperation.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```
// Parameters
N: number of players
R: number of rounds
K: multiplication factor
grace_period_rounds = min(floor(R / 4), 5) // Example: R/4 or 5, whichever is smaller

// History
player_actions_history = [] // List of lists, where each inner list is the actions of all players in a round
my_actions_history = []   // List of my actions

function decide_action(current_round, player_actions_history, my_actions_history):
    // Ensure history is populated for N-1 players for average calculation
    if len(player_actions_history) < current_round - 1:
        // Not enough history to make a calculated decision yet
        return 'C' // Default to cooperate if history is insufficient

    // Handle Last Round
    if current_round == R:
        return 'D'

    // Handle Grace Period
    if current_round <= grace_period_rounds:
        return 'C'

    // Calculate average cooperation rate from previous round
    previous_round_actions = player_actions_history[current_round - 2] // Index is current_round - 2 for 0-based indexing of history
    total_cooperators_prev_round = sum(1 for action in previous_round_actions if action == 'C')
    average_cooperation_rate = total_cooperators_prev_round / N

    // Decision Rule
    cooperation_threshold = K / N

    if average_cooperation_rate > cooperation_threshold:
        return 'C' // Continue cooperating if group is cooperating enough
    else:
        return 'D' // Defect if group cooperation is not beneficial

// In the game loop for each round:
// ...
// action_to_play = decide_action(t, all_past_actions, my_past_actions)
// ...
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

*   `player_actions_history`: This will store the history of actions taken by *all* players in each round. For calculating the average, we will need the actions of players other than ourselves.
*   `my_actions_history`: This stores our own past actions, though it's not strictly necessary for the decision logic of *this* strategy, it's good practice for potential future adaptations.
*   `decide_action` function: This encapsulates the strategy's logic.
*   `grace_period_rounds`: Calculated dynamically based on the total number of rounds.
*   The calculation of `average_cooperation_rate` uses the actions from the *immediately preceding* round (current\_round - 2 in the 0-indexed `player_actions_history`).
*   `cooperation_threshold` is the critical `k/n` value.

This strategy is designed to be a strong contender in a tournament by balancing the potential for high collective payoffs with the necessity of individual rationality, especially as the game concludes.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_66 = '''
This is an excellent setup for a strategic design! The N-Player Public Goods Game with repeated rounds presents a fascinating tension between individual incentives to defect and the collective benefit of cooperation.

My designed cooperative strategy focuses on **reciprocity and forgiveness**, tempered by a clear understanding of the game's structure and potential for exploitation. The core idea is to initiate cooperation and reward it, while punishing defection but offering a path back to cooperation.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Forgiving Reciprocity"

This strategy is designed to be **adaptive** by observing past behavior and **robust** by not being overly aggressive or passive. It aims to maximize the collective payoff while safeguarding against exploitation.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The central decision of "Forgiving Reciprocity" hinges on the **observed behavior of the group in the previous round**.

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   The **majority** of players cooperated in the **previous round**.
    *   OR if this is the **first round**.

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   The **majority** of players **defected** in the **previous round**.
    *   OR if the **number of cooperators in the previous round was less than half** of the total players (n/2). This is a stricter condition than just "majority defected" and aims to discourage continued cooperation when the collective benefit is clearly not being realized.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Always Cooperate (C).** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative approach is to initiate cooperation. This sets a positive precedent and allows the collective to potentially reach the higher payoff state.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** The logic here is the standard "end-game" effect in repeated games. Since there are no future rounds to influence or benefit from, the rational incentive is to defect and maximize individual payoff in that final round. There's no future punishment for defecting now.

### 3. Being Cooperative and Adaptive Logic

*   **Cooperative Foundation:** The strategy begins with cooperation and attempts to maintain it as long as the collective demonstrates a willingness to cooperate. This aligns with the "cooperative mindset."
*   **Observational Learning:** The strategy is adaptive because it directly learns from the aggregated behavior of other players in the previous round. It doesn't rely on assumptions about individual player strategies but rather on the emergent group behavior.
*   **Forgiveness with a Threshold:** The strategy is forgiving in that it will switch back to cooperation if the majority of players show a renewed willingness to do so. However, it's not blindly forgiving. The condition "number of cooperators in the previous round was less than half of the total players" acts as a "punishment threshold." If cooperation isn't yielding a reasonable collective outcome (less than half cooperating), it's time to defect.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Against Grim Trigger:** It doesn't immediately defect forever if one player defects. It waits for a majority to defect or for the cooperation level to drop below a threshold.
    *   **Against Tit-for-Tat (N-player variant):** It doesn't focus on a single opponent but on the collective. If the majority cooperates, it will cooperate, even if one specific player defected.
    *   **Against Pure Defection:** It initiates cooperation, giving the group a chance to reach a mutually beneficial outcome before resorting to defection.
    *   **Against Exploitation:** The threshold for defection (less than n/2 cooperators) prevents players from endlessly exploiting a cooperative strategy when the collective benefit is not being realized.

    // This provides a slight bias towards cooperation in ambiguous situations.
    return 'C'

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

*   `current_round`: The round number we are currently deciding for.
*   `history`: A 2D array or similar structure storing the actions of all players in all previous rounds. `history[t][i]` would be the action of player `i` in round `t`.
*   `player_id`: The index of the player for whom we are deciding the action. (Though this strategy doesn't use `player_id` directly, it's standard for a player-specific strategy function).
*   The logic follows the described rules: first and last rounds have special handling. For intermediate rounds, it counts cooperators in the *previous* round and makes a decision based on whether a majority cooperated or if the cooperation level fell below the crucial n/2 threshold. If neither of these strict conditions is met (e.g., exactly n/2 cooperated), the strategy defaults to cooperation, showing a slight bias towards maintaining cooperation.

This "Forgiving Reciprocity" strategy aims to foster cooperation by initiating it and rewarding its continuation, while also being pragmatic enough to defect when collective cooperation is demonstrably failing or when the end of the game is near.

description_COOPERATIVE_67 = '''
This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, adapting to the evolving game dynamics. It's inspired by well-known strategies like Tit-for-Tat but extends it to the public goods context.

## Cooperative Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity

This strategy's core principle is to reciprocate the average behavior of the group, tempered by the temptation to defect when it's highly profitable. It aims to maintain a cooperative state as long as it's collectively beneficial, and to punish deviations from this norm.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) for player `i` in round `t` is determined by the following logic:

*   **Initial Cooperative Push:** In the very first round, the strategy will **Cooperate (C)**. This signals a willingness to engage in cooperation and sets a positive initial tone.

*   **Adaptive Reciprocity (Rounds t > 1):** For subsequent rounds, the decision is based on the **average behavior of the group in the previous round**.
    *   Let `avg_c_t-1` be the average contribution rate in round `t-1`. This is calculated as: `avg_c_t-1 = (total number of cooperators in round t-1) / n`.
    *   **Cooperate (C):** If `avg_c_t-1` is above a certain **cooperation threshold (T_c)**, player `i` will **Cooperate (C)**. This threshold represents a minimum level of collective cooperation required to sustain individual cooperation.
    *   **Defect (D):** If `avg_c_t-1` falls below `T_c`, player `i` will **Defect (D)**. This acts as a punishment for insufficient collective cooperation.

*   **Exploitation Incentive Adjustment:** The strategy also considers the immediate incentive to defect. If defecting in the current round would yield a significantly higher payoff than cooperating, the strategy might be tempted to defect, even if the average cooperation is high.
    *   Let `current_payoff_defect` be the payoff if player `i` defects, assuming the current number of cooperators `N_c_t-1` from the previous round persists.
    *   Let `current_payoff_cooperate` be the payoff if player `i` cooperates, assuming the current number of cooperators `N_c_t-1` from the previous round persists.
    *   If `current_payoff_defect > current_payoff_cooperate + Exploitation_Buffer`, player `i` will **Defect (D)**. The `Exploitation_Buffer` is a small positive value that accounts for the risk and potential benefits of exploiting a situation.

**Combining the Rules:**

Player `i` will choose **Cooperate (C)** in round `t` if:
`avg_c_t-1 >= T_c`
**AND**
Player `i` will choose **Defect (D)** in round `t` if:
`avg_c_t-1 < T_c`
**OR**
`current_payoff_defect > current_payoff_cooperate + Exploitation_Buffer`

**Specific Parameter Values (to be determined through simulation/tuning):**

*   **Cooperation Threshold (T_c):** This value should be set such that sustained cooperation is individually rational. Given `1 < k < n`, if everyone cooperates, each player gets `k`. If one player defects, they get `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`, while others get `(k/n) * (n-1)`. For cooperation to be desirable, `k` should be greater than the payoff from defecting when everyone else cooperates: `k > 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. This simplifies to `k * (1 - (n-1)/n) > 1`, or `k/n > 1`. Since `k > n` is not allowed, this condition highlights the tension. A reasonable starting point for `T_c` could be slightly above the point where mutual defection is stable. Mutual defection yields a payoff of 1 for everyone. Cooperation is better when payoff is `k` (all cooperate) vs. `1` (all defect). So, we want to enforce cooperation when the average contribution is high enough to make cooperation appealing. Let's consider `T_c` to be **slightly above 0.5**. This means if at least half the players cooperated in the previous round, we continue to cooperate.

*   **Exploitation Buffer (Exploitation_Buffer):** This should be a small, positive value, perhaps on the order of **0.1 or 0.2**. This accounts for the fact that the payoff calculation in the public goods game is deterministic and the cost of misunderstanding or a single deviation is low if the group quickly reverts to cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** As stated, the strategy will **Cooperate (C)**. This is a crucial initial step to establish a cooperative norm.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the absence of future rounds, there is no incentive to cooperate for future gains. Therefore, in the **last round (t=r)**, the strategy will always **Defect (D)**. This is a standard result in game theory for finite repeated games with a known end.

*   **No Past History (Early Rounds):** For rounds where `t-1` is not yet fully observable (e.g., in the very first round or if data is somehow lost), the strategy defaults to its initial cooperative stance.

*   **Zero Cooperators in Previous Round:** If `avg_c_t-1 = 0`, the strategy will clearly **Defect (D)**.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is designed to be cooperative by:

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating, offering an olive branch to other players.
*   **Rewarding Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the group as a whole demonstrates a sufficient level of cooperation (`avg_c_t-1 >= T_c`). This reinforces cooperative behavior.
*   **Punishing Defection (but not excessively):** It defects when cooperation falters significantly. However, the punishment is not vindictive; it's a reactive measure to protect its own payoff and signal that defection has consequences. The strategy can revert to cooperation if the group returns to a cooperative state.
*   **Adaptive:** It learns from the group's past behavior and adjusts its actions accordingly. This makes it robust to different types of opponents, from purely cooperative to purely selfish.
*   **Exploitation Resistance:** The `Exploitation_Buffer` adds a layer of defense against being exploited by defectors.

```

This strategy is designed to be a good starting point for cooperative play. Its parameters (`T_c`, `Exploitation_Buffer`) can be fine-tuned through simulations to optimize performance in the tournament setting. The key is the balance between rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, adapted to the observed group behavior.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_68 = '''
This strategy aims to foster cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection, while also incorporating mechanisms to recover from periods of widespread defection. It's designed to be adaptive and robust to various opponent behaviors in a repeated-game setting without communication.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness"

This strategy combines elements of Tit-for-Tat (modified for N-players) with a capacity for forgiveness to adapt to dynamic opponent behavior. The core idea is to initially cooperate, respond to individual player defections by defecting against them, but also to have a mechanism to return to cooperation if the overall level of cooperation in the group improves.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The strategy's decision for player `i` in round `t` (let's call it `Action_i(t)`) depends on the observed actions of all players in the previous round `t-1`.

**Core Logic:**

*   **Initial Cooperation:** Start by cooperating. This sets a cooperative tone and allows for the collective good to be maximized if others reciprocate.
*   **Individual Punishment:** If another player `j` defected in the previous round (`Action_j(t-1) = D`), then player `i` will defect against player `j` in the current round (`Action_i(t)` against `j` becomes D). This is a targeted form of punishment.
*   **Collective Forgiveness/Re-evaluation:** If the *overall proportion of cooperators* in the previous round `t-1` exceeded a certain threshold, player `i` will consider cooperating again, even if some players defected. This allows the strategy to "forgive" minor defections or temporary lapses and return to the potentially more profitable state of widespread cooperation.

**Specific Decision Rules for Player `i` in Round `t > 1`:**

Let `C(t-1)` be the set of players who cooperated in round `t-1`, and `D(t-1)` be the set of players who defected in round `t-1`. Let `N_C(t-1) = |C(t-1)|` be the number of cooperators in round `t-1`.

1.  **If `t = 1` (First Round):**
    *   `Action_i(1) = C` (Always cooperate in the first round).

2.  **If `t > 1`:**
    *   **Check for widespread cooperation in the previous round:**
        *   Define a **Cooperation Threshold**, `T_C`. A reasonable starting point could be `T_C = n/2` (majority cooperation) or a value slightly lower than `n/2` to be more forgiving. We will refine this.
        *   If `N_C(t-1) / n >= T_C`:
            *   **General Rule:** `Action_i(t) = C`
            *   **Exception:** However, player `i` will still defect against any *specific player j* who was a *persistent defector* in previous rounds. (See definition of persistent defector below).

    *   **If widespread cooperation did not occur in the previous round (`N_C(t-1) / n < T_C`):**
        *   **Individual Response:** For each player `j` from `1` to `n`:
            *   If `Action_j(t-1) = D`:
                *   `Action_i(t)` will be `D` (defect against player `j`).
            *   If `Action_j(t-1) = C`:
                *   `Action_i(t)` will be `C` (cooperate with player `j`).
        *   This ensures that player `i` retaliates against each individual defector while still cooperating with those who cooperated in the last round.

**Refinement of Cooperation Threshold `T_C`:**

The `T_C` can be adaptive. Initially, we can set it to `n/2`. However, if the strategy consistently finds itself in low-cooperation rounds despite trying to be forgiving, it might need to raise the threshold. Conversely, if high cooperation is sustained, it can potentially lower it slightly to be more forgiving. For simplicity in this initial design, we'll keep `T_C` fixed, but an advanced version could adapt `T_C` based on the average payoff achieved in recent rounds.

**Definition of Persistent Defector:**

A player `j` is considered a "persistent defector" if they have defected in a certain number of the last `m` rounds, where `m` is a parameter (e.g., `m = 3` or `m = 5`). This prevents a single defection from triggering permanent punishment and allows for recovery from temporary lapses.

*   **If `t > m` and player `j` defected in `m` or more of the last `m` rounds:** Player `j` is a persistent defector.
*   **If `t <= m`:** A player is a persistent defector if they have defected in all `t-1` previous rounds.

**Putting it together for `t > 1`:**

For each player `j` (including `i` itself):

*   Initialize `Action_i(t)_against_j = C`.
*   If player `j` was a persistent defector (based on history up to `t-1`):
    *   `Action_i(t)_against_j = D`.
*   Else if `N_C(t-1) / n >= T_C`:
    *   `Action_i(t)_against_j = C` (This is the default if not a persistent defector and there was overall cooperation).
*   Else (if `N_C(t-1) / n < T_C` and `j` is not a persistent defector):
    *   If `Action_j(t-1) = D`:
        *   `Action_i(t)_against_j = D`.
    *   Else (`Action_j(t-1) = C`):
        *   `Action_i(t)_against_j = C`.

**Overall Action `Action_i(t)`:** Player `i`'s actual action in round `t` is `C` if `Action_i(t)_against_j = C` for *all* `j`. Player `i`'s action is `D` if `Action_i(t)_against_j = D` for *at least one* `j`. This means player `i` will defect if they are punishing any other player.

**Simplified interpretation of `Action_i(t)`:**

*   **Cooperate (`C`) if:**
    1.  It's the first round.
    2.  The proportion of cooperators in the previous round was above `T_C`, AND no player is a persistent defector.
*   **Defect (`D`) if:**
    1.  Any player `j` was a persistent defector.
    2.  The proportion of cooperators in the previous round was below `T_C`, AND player `j` defected in the previous round.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t = 1`):** Always cooperate. This is the fundamental assumption of "start cooperatively."
*   **Last Round (`t = r`):** In a finitely repeated game with a known end, the standard Nash Equilibrium is for all players to defect in every round. However, the prompt implies a strategy that tries to be cooperative. Therefore, this strategy will *not* change its behavior in the last round. It will continue to follow the rules defined above. This is a deliberate choice to prioritize the potential long-term benefits of cooperation, even in the final round, making it robust to opponents who might not fully exploit the end-game. If the tournament meta-game punishes this, a more sophisticated strategy might defect in the last round.
*   **No Previous History (for persistence check at `t <= m`):** When checking for persistent defectors in early rounds (where `t <= m`), we simply consider the available history. For example, in round 3, we check the last 3 rounds (rounds 1 and 2). If a player defected in both rounds 1 and 2, they would be considered a persistent defector.

### 3. Be Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative due to its initial stance and its desire to return to cooperation when circumstances permit.

*   **Initial Cooperative Stance:** The strategy *starts* with an act of trust and cooperation.
*   **Reciprocal Cooperation:** It reciprocates cooperation, meaning if others cooperate, it will too.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** The `T_C` threshold allows the strategy to "forgive" periods of defection if overall cooperation re-emerges. This prevents getting locked into perpetual defection cycles, which would be detrimental to everyone.
*   **Targeted Punishment:** Punishment is directed and proportional, not indiscriminate. It's a response to observed behavior, aiming to guide others back to cooperation rather than purely seeking individual gain through defection.
*   **Robustness:** By not immediately retaliating with defection against a single lapse and by having a mechanism to re-engage in cooperation, it is more robust to "noisy" or "accidental" defections and can recover from periods of low cooperation.

                // If 'j' is not a persistent defector and overall cooperation is high, I cooperate with 'j'.
                pass // No change needed, my_action remains C for now if not set to D

    return my_action

```

This strategy offers a balance between rewarding good behavior, punishing persistent bad behavior, and retaining the possibility of widespread cooperation. It avoids immediate retaliation for single defections, making it forgiving and resilient to random deviations.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_69 = '''
Here's a design for a cooperative, adaptive, and robust strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on natural language description with pseudocode for clarity.

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness (ARF)

**Core Principle:** ARF aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but it incorporates forgiveness to avoid descending into perpetual defection. It learns from past behavior to adjust its own actions.

### 1. Decision Rules

ARF's decision in any given round is a balance between rewarding past cooperation and deterring future defection.

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the early stages of the game, ARF will lean towards cooperation to establish a cooperative norm and explore its potential benefits.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** After the initial phase, ARF will primarily mirror the behavior of the majority of players in the previous round.
    *   If a **majority** of players (more than n/2) cooperated in the previous round, ARF will **Cooperate (C)** in the current round.
    *   If a **minority** of players (n/2 or fewer) cooperated in the previous round (meaning a majority defected), ARF will **Defect (D)** in the current round.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** While defection is punished, ARF will not *permanently* defect if the majority defects. It will maintain a "forgiveness counter." If a period of time passes without widespread cooperation (i.e., the majority consistently defects), the forgiveness counter increases. Once the forgiveness counter reaches a certain threshold, ARF will attempt to "rebuild" cooperation by cooperating, even if the majority defected in the previous round. This offers a chance for the group to return to cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   ARF will **Cooperate (C)**. The rationale is to initiate a cooperative interaction and signal a willingness to trust. This is the most crucial step in establishing a potential for cooperative equilibrium, especially given the constraint of no pre-communication.
*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   ARF will **Defect (D)**. In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The incentive to cooperate for future gains disappears. Therefore, in the last round, it's rational to maximize individual payoff by keeping the endowment. This is a standard "unraveling" argument in repeated games, and ARF acknowledges this deterministic last-round incentive.
*   **Near the End of the Game (t = r-1, r-2, etc.):** ARF's behavior will still be governed by the conditional cooperation rule. However, the increasing proximity to the last round might subtly influence the *effectiveness* of the forgiveness mechanism, as there's less "time" to recover from a defection spiral. The strategy remains consistent, but the game-theoretic implications change.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The strategy is designed to be cooperative through several mechanisms:

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating, demonstrating a belief in the potential for positive outcomes from mutual contribution.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation with more cooperation. This creates a positive feedback loop for cooperative behavior.
*   **Forgiveness:** It doesn't immediately punish a single instance of defection or a short-lived bout of defection. The forgiveness counter allows for a return to cooperation even after periods of widespread defection, giving the group another chance to find a cooperative equilibrium. This prevents the strategy from being overly sensitive to noise or single rogue players.
*   **Majority Rule:** Basing its decision on the majority behavior is a form of collective decision-making. It aims to align with what the group *is* doing, rather than solely reacting to one or two deviants, which is a more robust approach in a group setting.

            // Forgiveness threshold reached, attempt to re-initiate cooperation
            // Reset forgiveness and attempt to cooperate, even if majority defected
            forgiveness_counter = 0
            return C

// Update history after each round (to be called by the game engine)
function update_history(actions_this_round):
    history_of_actions.append(actions_this_round)

```

### Robustness and Adaptability Explanation

*   **Adaptability:** The strategy adapts by observing the collective behavior of the group in the previous round and adjusting its own actions accordingly. The `forgiveness_counter` and `FORGIVENESS_THRESHOLD` introduce a form of "memory" and dynamic adjustment to sustained negative trends.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   **To Noise:** By looking at the *majority* behavior, ARF is less susceptible to being misled by the actions of one or two rogue players.
    *   **To Mixed Strategies:** It doesn't assume any specific opponent strategy. It reacts to whatever the group collectively chooses.
    *   **To "Grim Trigger" Pitfalls:** Unlike a simple "grim trigger" strategy (defect forever if anyone defects), ARF's forgiveness mechanism prevents an irreversible descent into mutual defection if a slight deviation occurs or if the group is trying to find its way back to cooperation.
    *   **No Pre-Coordination:** The strategy relies solely on observable history and game parameters, fulfilling the constraint of no communication or assumed coordination.

This strategy aims to create a stable cooperative environment when possible, but also provides pathways back to cooperation after periods of defection, making it a resilient choice in a competitive tournament setting.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_70 = '''
This is a classic N-player Public Goods Game, and designing a cooperative strategy within these constraints requires careful consideration of the incentives and the repeated nature of the interaction. The core tension is that while mutual cooperation yields the highest *joint* payoff, individual defection in any given round is always tempting because the player keeps their endowment and still receives a share of the public good, even if others contribute.

Here's a cooperative strategy designed to be adaptive and robust, focusing on incentivizing cooperation while being resilient to defection. It's inspired by well-known strategies in repeated games, adapted for the public goods context.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Reciprocity with Commitment"

This strategy is based on a principle of **conditional reciprocity**, meaning it cooperates as long as others do, but it also incorporates a **commitment mechanism** to discourage free-riding and encourage long-term cooperation. It's designed to be adaptive by monitoring the behavior of other players.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of the strategy is to monitor the level of cooperation in the previous round and adjust its behavior accordingly.

*   **Initial State (Round 1):** Start by cooperating. This signals a willingness to engage in mutual cooperation and potentially establish a baseline of good behavior.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Calculate the "Cooperation Rate" (CR_t-1):** In the previous round (t-1), calculate the proportion of players who cooperated:
        `CR_t-1 = (Number of cooperators in round t-1) / n`
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If CR_t-1 >= Threshold_Cooperate:** Cooperate in the current round (t). This means that if the majority of players cooperated in the previous round, or if the cooperation rate meets a certain benchmark, we continue to cooperate.
        *   **If CR_t-1 < Threshold_Cooperate:** Defect in the current round (t). If cooperation falls below the threshold, it indicates a lack of widespread commitment to the public good, and defecting becomes the rational response to protect one's own endowment and signal disapproval.

**Defining `Threshold_Cooperate`:**

This is a crucial parameter that determines how forgiving the strategy is. A higher threshold means it requires more cooperation to continue cooperating.

*   **Recommendation:** `Threshold_Cooperate` should be set to `k/n`.
    *   **Rationale:** `k/n` represents the average payoff *per unit of contribution* when everyone else contributes. If the total contribution is less than `k`, then the average return to each unit contributed is less than 1. In other words, if the total contribution is such that `(k/n) * Total_Contributions < 1`, then a cooperator in the previous round would have been better off defecting. Setting the threshold at `k/n` aligns the decision to cooperate with whether cooperation was *collectively* beneficial in the previous round. If the cooperation rate is below `k/n`, it implies that on average, cooperating was not rewarding enough to justify continuing to do so.

**Formalizing the Decision Rule:**

Let `C_t` be the number of cooperators in round `t`.
Let `P_i,t` be the payoff for player `i` in round `t`.
Let `a_i,t` be the action of player `i` in round `t` (`C` or `D`).
Let `c_i,t` be the numerical representation of `a_i,t` (1 for `C`, 0 for `D`).

**Strategy for Player `i`:**

*   **Round 1:** Play `C`.
*   **Round `t` > 1:**
    *   Calculate `C_{t-1} = Σ(j=1 to n) c_{j, t-1}`.
    *   Calculate `CR_{t-1} = C_{t-1} / n`.
    *   **If `CR_{t-1} >= k/n`:** Play `C` in round `t`.
    *   **If `CR_{t-1} < k/n`:** Play `D` in round `t`.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (r=1):** As stated above, always start with `C`. This is a generous opening move to try and establish cooperation.

*   **Last Round (r):** This is the most challenging edge case in repeated games due to the **end-game problem**. In the final round, there is no future consequence for defecting. Therefore, rational players will always defect in the last round, regardless of past behavior. This strategy acknowledges this and plays defect in the last round.
    *   **Decision for Round `r`:** Always play `D`.
    *   **Rationale:** This is a strategic concession to the game's structure. While counter to the "cooperative" label, it's a necessary pragmatic adaptation to ensure the highest possible payoff in a situation with no future repercussions for defection. It doesn't undermine the strategy's cooperative intent in prior rounds, which are designed to foster sustained cooperation.

*   **Initial Cooperation Rate is Low:** If `CR_0 = 0` (e.g., if there's a meta-strategy that defects in round 1), the `CR_t-1 >= k/n` condition will immediately fail (assuming `k/n > 0`). The strategy will then defect. This is the intended response to pervasive defection.

*   **Oscillating Behavior:** If the cooperation rate hovers around `k/n`, the strategy might oscillate between cooperating and defecting. This is acceptable as it reflects the dynamic of the group's behavior.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The "cooperative" nature of this strategy is evident in several ways:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** It always starts by cooperating, giving the group the best chance to establish a cooperative norm.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the group's overall cooperation level is deemed sufficiently beneficial (i.e., `CR_t-1 >= k/n`). This rewards collective good behavior.
*   **Discourages Free-Riding:** By defecting when cooperation falters, it punishes free-riders and signals that defection will not go unnoticed or unpunished in the long run. This is a form of reciprocity.
*   **Adaptive:** It's not rigidly fixed. It adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of others, making it robust to various opponent strategies.
*   **Focus on Collective Benefit (Indirectly):** While individual payoffs are the ultimate metric, the strategy attempts to achieve them by fostering a state of high collective contribution, which is known to generate higher total payoffs for the group than universal defection.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between being altruistic enough to facilitate cooperation and pragmatic enough to avoid being exploited. Its success will depend on the collective behavior of the other players in the tournament.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_71 = '''
Here's a design for a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptation and robustness:

## Strategy: Reciprocity with Forgiveness (RWf)

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a built-in mechanism to re-establish cooperation after periods of conflict. It's designed to be adaptive to varying levels of cooperation from opponents and robust against exploitation.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Initial Cooperation:** Start by assuming others will cooperate. This is the most optimistic and potentially rewarding starting point for the public good.
2.  **Conditional Reciprocity:** If others cooperate, continue to cooperate. If others defect, punish them by defecting.
3.  **Forgiveness:** After a period of sustained defection, be willing to re-initiate cooperation to see if the group can return to a mutually beneficial state. This prevents the strategy from being perpetually stuck in a low-payoff defection cycle.
4.  **Adaptation to Group Behavior:** The strategy's decision-making is influenced by the *overall* level of cooperation observed in the group, not just individual players (though individual history will be tracked for a more refined approach).

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of RWf is a state-based decision mechanism. We'll maintain an internal state that tracks the perceived cooperative tendency of the group.

**Internal States:**

*   **STATE_COOPERATING:** The group is generally cooperating, and this strategy will cooperate.
*   **STATE_PUNISHING:** The group has recently shown significant defection, and this strategy will defect to signal disapproval.
*   **STATE_FORGIVING:** A period of punishment has passed, and this strategy is willing to try cooperating again to see if the group will reciprocate.

**Transition Rules:**

*   **From STATE_COOPERATING:**
    *   If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round (`prop_cooperators_t-1`) is **greater than or equal to a cooperation threshold (e.g., 0.75 * n)**, remain in **STATE_COOPERATING**.
    *   If `prop_cooperators_t-1` is **less than the cooperation threshold**, transition to **STATE_PUNISHING**.
*   **From STATE_PUNISHING:**
    *   If `prop_cooperators_t-1` is **greater than or equal to the cooperation threshold**, transition back to **STATE_COOPERATING**.
    *   If `prop_cooperators_t-1` is **less than the cooperation threshold**, remain in **STATE_PUNISHING** for a predetermined number of rounds (`punishment_duration`). After `punishment_duration` rounds of sustained low cooperation, transition to **STATE_FORGIVING**.
*   **From STATE_FORGIVING:**
    *   If `prop_cooperators_t-1` is **greater than or equal to the cooperation threshold**, transition back to **STATE_COOPERATING**.
    *   If `prop_cooperators_t-1` is **less than the cooperation threshold**, transition back to **STATE_PUNISHING**.

**Action Rules:**

*   **If in STATE_COOPERATING:** Play **C**.
*   **If in STATE_PUNISHING:** Play **D**.
*   **If in STATE_FORGIVING:** Play **C**.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always play **C**. This is the optimistic start, and it's impossible to have any history to base a decision on.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** Always play **D**. In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation for. The dominant strategy is to defect to maximize individual payoff. This is a standard assumption in finitely repeated games.
*   **Short Games (r=2):** In this case, the "last round" rule dominates for t=2. For t=1, play C.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative in its design:

*   **Initiation:** It starts with cooperation, signaling a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial behavior.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation from others, reinforcing the positive.
*   **Forgiveness:** It doesn't hold grudges indefinitely. The "FORGIVING" state is crucial for allowing the group to return to cooperation after potential conflicts, preventing a descent into a Nash Equilibrium of mutual defection that yields lower total welfare.
*   **Adaptation:** By monitoring the group's behavior, it tries to find the optimal balance between cooperation and self-preservation, aiming for the highest *joint* payoff over the long term, as long as the group reciprocates.

### Parameter Tuning (Internal to the Strategy):

*   **Cooperation Threshold:** This is a critical parameter. A value like `0.75 * n` means that if three-quarters of the group cooperates, we consider it "cooperative enough" to continue cooperating. This can be adjusted.
*   **Punishment Duration:** The number of consecutive rounds the strategy will play 'D' before entering the 'FORGIVING' state. A value like `2` or `3` rounds might be a good starting point. This prevents overreaction to single instances of defection.

### Pseudocode Representation:

            else:
                // Continue punishing

    else if current_state == STATE_FORGIVING:
        if prop_cooperators_prev_round >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD_RATIO:

        else:
            // Forgiveness didn't lead to cooperation, go back to punishing
            current_state = STATE_PUNISHING
            punishment_rounds_counter = 0 // Reset counter, as we are starting a new punishment phase
            return D

// Initialization:
// When the game starts, initialize current_state to STATE_COOPERATING and punishment_rounds_counter to 0.
// The 'all_actions_history' and 'my_actions_history' will be updated by the game engine each round.
```

This strategy provides a balance between maintaining cooperation and responding to defection, with a mechanism to recover from unproductive cycles of mutual punishment. Its adaptive nature comes from reacting to the observed group behavior, and its robustness is enhanced by the forgiveness mechanism.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_72 = '''
Here's a strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, aiming for cooperation while being adaptive and robust:

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (AT4T)

This strategy is designed to be generally cooperative but capable of defending against persistent defection. It is inspired by the successful Tit-for-Tat strategy in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma but adapted for the public goods context.

### Core Principle:

**Start cooperative, reciprocate the previous round's *overall* cooperation level, but with a bias towards cooperation and a mechanism to prevent exploitation.**

### 1. Decision Rules:

My decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` (for `t > 1`) depends on the collective behavior of all players in round `t-1`. Specifically, I will consider the **proportion of cooperators** in the previous round.

Let $C_{t-1}$ be the number of players who played 'C' in round $t-1$.
Let $N_{t-1} = C_{t-1} / n$ be the proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$.

My decision rule for round `t` is as follows:

*   **If $N_{t-1}$ is sufficiently high:** I will Cooperate (C).
*   **If $N_{t-1}$ is sufficiently low:** I will Defect (D).
*   **If $N_{t-1}$ is in an intermediate range:** I will err on the side of cooperation, but with a slight inclination to punish deviations from higher cooperation levels.

To formalize this, I will use a threshold-based approach. The specific thresholds will be dynamically adjusted.

**Initial Thresholds (for Round 2):**
*   Let's define a "cooperative threshold" $T_{coop}$ and a "defect threshold" $T_{defect}$.
*   A good starting point for these thresholds could be derived from the game parameters. Since $k < n$, a scenario where everyone cooperates yields a higher payoff per player than when everyone defects. $k/n$ represents the private return from a public contribution. If $k/n$ is high, cooperation is more appealing.

**Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
*   If the overall cooperation level in the previous round was high (e.g., above a certain baseline), I will slightly lower the threshold for defecting, making it harder for players to get away with defection.
*   If the overall cooperation level was low, I will slightly raise the threshold for defecting, being more forgiving and attempting to re-establish cooperation.

**My Decision Logic (Round t > 1):**

1.  **Calculate $N_{t-1}$**: The proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$.
2.  **Assess $N_{t-1}$ against dynamic thresholds $T_{coop}(t-1)$ and $T_{defect}(t-1)$:**
    *   If $N_{t-1} \ge T_{coop}(t-1)$: **Play C**. (The collective is cooperating well).
    *   If $N_{t-1} < T_{defect}(t-1)$: **Play D**. (The collective is defecting too much, I will punish).
    *   If $T_{defect}(t-1) \le N_{t-1} < T_{coop}(t-1)$: **Play C**. (I will still try to cooperate in ambiguous situations, but I'll be watching).

**Threshold Adjustment Rule:**

*   Let's define a "target cooperation rate" that is generally high, say $0.7$ (70%).
*   If $N_{t-1}$ is significantly above the target cooperation rate, I might slightly *lower* $T_{defect}$ for the next round to be more sensitive to any emerging defection.
*   If $N_{t-1}$ is significantly below the target cooperation rate, I might slightly *raise* $T_{defect}$ (making it easier to forgive) and potentially *lower* $T_{coop}$ (making it easier to fall back to defection if cooperation doesn't improve).

**Refinement: A "Punishment Trigger"**

Instead of a gradual shift based on the proportion, a more robust approach could be:

*   **Cooperate:** As long as the proportion of cooperators in the previous round is above a certain **high threshold** (e.g., 60%).
*   **Punish (Defect):** If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round drops below a certain **low threshold** (e.g., 30%) for a certain number of consecutive rounds. This prevents immediate, knee-jerk reactions to a single bad round.
*   **Cautious Cooperation:** In intermediate ranges, or after a period of punishment, I will generally cooperate to try and rebuild trust.

This leads to a more concrete rule:

**Revised Decision Rules (Round t > 1):**

1.  **Calculate $N_{t-1}$**: Proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$.
2.  **Maintain a "Cooperation Streak" counter:** `streak_coop` = number of consecutive rounds where $N_{t-1}$ was above a "good enough" level (e.g., 50%).
3.  **Maintain a "Defection Streak" counter:** `streak_defect` = number of consecutive rounds where $N_{t-1}$ was below a "problematic" level (e.g., 30%).

*   **If $N_{t-1} \ge 0.6$ (High Cooperation):** **Play C**. Increment `streak_coop`, reset `streak_defect`.
*   **Else if $N_{t-1} < 0.3$ (Low Cooperation):**
    *   **If `streak_defect` >= 2 (Persistent Defection):** **Play D**. Increment `streak_defect`, reset `streak_coop`.
    *   **Else (Temporary low cooperation):** **Play C**. Increment `streak_defect`, reset `streak_coop`.
*   **Else (Intermediate cooperation: $0.3 \le N_{t-1} < 0.6$):**
    *   **Play C**. Increment `streak_coop`, reset `streak_defect`.

This strategy prioritizes building cooperation. It only defects if cooperation consistently fails for a sustained period.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the first round, there is no history to learn from. Starting cooperatively is the most direct way to align with the "cooperative mindset" and signal a willingness to engage in collective benefit. It gives other players the best chance to also cooperate, leading to a potentially high payoff for everyone.

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is a standard feature of strategies in finite repeated games, known as the "end-game effect." Since there are no future rounds to influence, the incentive to cooperate for future benefits disappears. In the last round, each player's best individual strategy is to defect, as this maximizes their immediate payoff from their endowment without repercussions. The payoff function $\pi_i = (1 - c_i) + (k/n) \times \Sigma c_j$ shows that if I defect ($c_i=0$), my payoff is $1 + (k/n) \times \Sigma c_j$. If I cooperate ($c_i=1$), my payoff is $0 + (k/n) \times (\Sigma c_j + 1)$. For this to be beneficial for me to cooperate, $ (k/n) \times (\Sigma c_j + 1) > 1 + (k/n) \times \Sigma c_j $, which simplifies to $k/n > 1$. However, the game specification states $k < n$, so $k/n < 1$. This means that in the last round, defecting is always the dominant strategy for an individual player, regardless of others' actions.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Default Action:** The default action is **Cooperate**. Defection is only a reactive measure to sustained uncooperative behavior from the group.
*   **Forgiveness:** The strategy incorporates a degree of forgiveness. It doesn't defect after a single round of low cooperation. It requires a pattern of defection to trigger its own defection.
*   **Re-establishment of Cooperation:** Even after a period of defection, if the group's behavior shifts back to higher cooperation, the AT4T strategy will resume cooperation to try and rebuild the mutually beneficial dynamic.
*   **Focus on Collective Benefit:** By prioritizing cooperation and only retaliating against consistent defection, the strategy aims to foster environments where the higher payoffs from collective cooperation can be realized. The "punishment" of defection is not malicious but a signal to change behavior to enable mutual gain.

Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Forgiving Reciprocity"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a crucial element of forgiveness to avoid perpetual cycles of conflict. It's built on the principle of reciprocity, but not blind adherence to it.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core of "Forgiving Reciprocity" lies in a dynamic threshold that determines cooperation. This threshold is influenced by the observed behavior of other players.

*   **Initial State:** In the very first round, the strategy will cooperate. This sets a cooperative tone and allows for observation.

*   **Cooperation Threshold:** The strategy maintains a "Cooperation Threshold" (CT). This CT represents the minimum proportion of observed players that *must* have cooperated in the *previous round* for the strategy to consider cooperating in the current round.

    *   **Initial CT:** Starts at 1.0 (meaning 100% cooperation is required to trigger cooperation).
    *   **Decreasing CT (Forgiveness):** If the strategy observes that the actual proportion of cooperators in the previous round was *less* than the current CT, but *greater than zero*, the CT will be slightly decreased. This represents forgiveness – it lowers the bar for future cooperation if there was at least some cooperation, even if it didn't meet the previous threshold. This prevents a single round of defection from permanently shutting down cooperation.
    *   **Increasing CT (Punishment):** If the strategy observes that the actual proportion of cooperators in the previous round was *less* than the current CT and *also less than the proportion of defections*, the CT will be slightly increased. This signals a more cautious stance and demands a higher level of cooperation in the future.
    *   **Resetting CT (Strong Defection):** If the strategy observes that *no* players cooperated in the previous round (total_contributions = 0), the CT will be reset to 1.0. This is a strong signal that cooperation has failed and a high bar is needed to re-establish it.

*   **Decision Logic for Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**
    1.  **Observe Past Round (`t-1`):** Calculate the actual proportion of cooperators in round `t-1`: `actual_cooperation_rate = total_contributions_{t-1} / n`.
    2.  **Update Cooperation Threshold (CT):**
        *   If `actual_cooperation_rate == 0`: Set `CT = 1.0`.
        *   Else if `actual_cooperation_rate < CT` and `actual_cooperation_rate > 0`: Decrease `CT` by a small fixed amount (e.g., `0.05`). This is the "forgiveness" mechanism.
        *   Else if `actual_cooperation_rate < CT` and `actual_cooperation_rate <= (n - total_contributions_{t-1}) / n`: Increase `CT` by a small fixed amount (e.g., `0.02`). This is the "punishment" mechanism for widespread defection.
        *   Otherwise (if `actual_cooperation_rate >= CT`): `CT` remains unchanged.
    3.  **Make Current Decision:**
        *   If `actual_cooperation_rate >= CT`: Play **C (Cooperate)**.
        *   Else: Play **D (Defect)**.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (`r=1`):**
    *   Always play **C (Cooperate)**. The CT starts at 1.0, but since there's no history, we initiate cooperation.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   Always play **D (Defect)**. In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The incentive to cooperate for future rounds disappears, making pure self-interest (keeping the endowment) the rational choice. This is a standard assumption in finite repeated games.

*   **Parameters:** The strategy is entirely dependent on the game parameters (`n`, `r`, `k`) for its structure and the *rate* at which the CT changes. The specific values of `k` relative to `n` implicitly influence the expected payoff and therefore the viability of cooperation, but the strategy doesn't directly use `k` in its decision logic, making it general. The CT adjustment values are hyper-parameters that can be tuned, but here we suggest fixed small values for simplicity.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The "Forgiving Reciprocity" strategy is inherently cooperative in its intent:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating, signaling a desire for mutual benefit.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** By maintaining or decreasing the CT when cooperation is observed, it encourages continued cooperative behavior.
*   **Forgives Occasional Defection:** The slight decrease in CT for partial cooperation allows for recovery from temporary lapses, fostering long-term cooperation rather than immediate retribution.
*   **Punishes Widespread Defection:** The increase in CT when defection dominates is a necessary defense mechanism to prevent the strategy from being exploited. It signals that a higher standard of cooperation is required to re-engage.
*   **Adaptive:** The CT dynamically adjusts based on observed behavior, making it resilient to various opponent types, from consistently cooperative to consistently defecting, or mixed strategies.

### Pseudocode

```pseudocode
// Game Parameters: n, r, k
// State Variables:
//   cooperation_threshold (float, initialized to 1.0)
//   history (list of observed total_contributions for each round)

// Function: MakeDecision(current_round, n, r, k, history, cooperation_threshold)

// --- First Round ---
if current_round == 1:
  // Always cooperate in the first round to initiate
  return "C"

// --- Last Round ---
if current_round == r:
  // Always defect in the last round as there are no future consequences
  return "D"

// --- Intermediate Rounds ---

// Get observations from the previous round
if length(history) == 0: // Should not happen for current_round > 1, but for safety
  return "C" // Default to cooperation if no history available

previous_total_contributions = history[current_round - 2] // Indexing from 0, history stores r-1 values for rounds 1 to r-1
previous_cooperation_rate = previous_total_contributions / n

// Update Cooperation Threshold (CT)
new_cooperation_threshold = cooperation_threshold

if previous_cooperation_rate == 0:
  new_cooperation_threshold = 1.0 // Reset CT if no one cooperated
else if previous_cooperation_rate < cooperation_threshold:
  // "Forgiveness" mechanism: If some cooperation happened, but not enough
  new_cooperation_threshold = cooperation_threshold - 0.05 // Small decrease
else if previous_cooperation_rate < cooperation_threshold and previous_cooperation_rate <= (n - previous_total_contributions) / n:
  // "Punishment" mechanism: Widespread defection below threshold
  new_cooperation_threshold = cooperation_threshold + 0.02 // Small increase

// Ensure CT stays within bounds [0, 1]
new_cooperation_threshold = max(0.0, min(1.0, new_cooperation_threshold))
cooperation_threshold = new_cooperation_threshold // Update the global/persistent threshold

// Make current decision based on the updated threshold
if previous_cooperation_rate >= cooperation_threshold:
  return "C"
else:
  return "D"

// --- End Function ---

// To use this strategy:
// Initialize cooperation_threshold = 1.0
// Initialize history = []
// For each round t from 1 to r:
//   action = MakeDecision(t, n, r, k, history, cooperation_threshold)
//   // Play action and record results
//   // Record total_contributions for round t in history
```

This strategy aims to find a balance between promoting cooperation and protecting itself from exploitation, making it a robust candidate for a tournament setting.

Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness, adhering to the specified constraints.

## Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Thresholding (ART)

**Core Philosophy:** The ART strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while maintaining a strong incentive to cooperate as long as the collective benefit outweighs the individual cost. It is designed to be adaptive to the observed behavior of other players and robust against various defection patterns.

**1. Decision Rules:**

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` for player `i` is based on the observed level of cooperation in the previous round (`t-1`) and a dynamic threshold.

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the very first round (`t=1`), ART will always **Cooperate (C)**. This is a strong signal of good faith and aims to initiate a cooperative environment.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Calculate Observed Cooperation Rate:** In round `t-1`, count the total number of players who cooperated (let's call this `N_cooperators_t-1`). Calculate the observed cooperation rate: `CooperationRate_t-1 = N_cooperators_t-1 / n`.
    *   **Determine Dynamic Threshold:** The dynamic threshold is designed to be sensitive to the overall level of cooperation.
        *   If `CooperationRate_t-1` is high (e.g., above a certain percentage, say 75%), the threshold for continued cooperation is high.
        *   If `CooperationRate_t-1` is low, the threshold for cooperation becomes lower, making it easier to defect.
        *   A simple way to implement this dynamic threshold is to use the observed cooperation rate itself as a benchmark. We can set a **target cooperation rate**, let's call it `TargetCoopRate` (e.g., 0.8 or 80% of players).
        *   If `CooperationRate_t-1` is greater than or equal to `TargetCoopRate`, the decision rule favors cooperation.
        *   If `CooperationRate_t-1` is less than `TargetCoopRate`, the decision rule favors defection.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `CooperationRate_t-1` >= `TargetCoopRate`**: Player `i` will **Cooperate (C)**. This signifies that the group is largely cooperating, and continuing to do so is likely beneficial.
        *   **If `CooperationRate_t-1` < `TargetCoopRate`**: Player `i` will **Defect (D)**. This signifies that the group is not cooperating enough to justify the individual cost of contributing, and it's more rational to protect one's endowment.

*   **Endgame Consideration (Last Round):** In the very last round (`t=r`), the incentive to cooperate disappears as there are no future rounds to benefit from. Therefore, in the last round, ART will **always Defect (D)**. This is a rational response to the finite nature of the game.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t=1):** As stated, ART will always **Cooperate (C)**. This is crucial to kickstart cooperation and signal a cooperative intent. It's a risk, but a calculated one to potentially achieve higher payoffs in subsequent rounds.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** As stated, ART will always **Defect (D)**. This is a standard and rational response to the last round of a repeated game with a finite horizon.

*   **No Prior History (t=1):** This is handled by the "First Round" rule.

*   **All Players Defect in previous round:** If `CooperationRate_t-1` is 0, the condition `CooperationRate_t-1 < TargetCoopRate` will always be true (assuming `TargetCoopRate` is greater than 0), leading ART to defect. This is a mechanism to punish widespread defection.

*   **All Players Cooperate in previous round:** If `CooperationRate_t-1` is 1, the condition `CooperationRate_t-1 >= TargetCoopRate` will be true (assuming `TargetCoopRate` is less than or equal to 1), leading ART to cooperate. This reinforces successful cooperation.

**3. Being Cooperative:**

ART is inherently cooperative in its design:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** The strategy starts by cooperating, demonstrating a willingness to contribute to the common good.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the observed behavior of the group suggests that cooperation is prevalent and beneficial. This rewards existing cooperation and encourages its continuation.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The `TargetCoopRate` acts as a flexible benchmark. It's not a rigid "cooperate only if everyone else does" rule, but rather a nuanced response to the group's overall behavior. This allows for periods of lower cooperation without immediate collapse, but also prevents exploitation.
*   **Punishes Defection (Indirectly):** By defecting when cooperation rates fall below the threshold, ART implicitly punishes defectors. This is not an aggressive retaliation, but a rational self-preservation that discourages future defection by making it less profitable in the aggregate.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```pseudocode
// Parameters
n: integer // number of players
r: integer // number of rounds
k: float // multiplication factor
TargetCoopRate: float // e.g., 0.8 (80%)

// State Variables
last_round_actions: list of actions // Stores actions of all players in the previous round
round_number: integer // Current round number

// Function: DecideAction(round_number, last_round_actions)
function DecideAction(current_round, history):
  if current_round == 1:
    return "C" // Always cooperate in the first round

  if current_round == r:
    return "D" // Always defect in the last round

  // Calculate observed cooperation rate from the previous round
  cooperators_in_previous_round = count("C" in history)
  observed_cooperation_rate = cooperators_in_previous_round / n

  // Decision based on observed cooperation rate and target rate
  if observed_cooperation_rate >= TargetCoopRate:
    return "C" // Cooperate if the group is largely cooperating
  else:
    return "D" // Defect if the group is not cooperating enough

// Main Game Loop (conceptual)
for t from 1 to r:
  // ... (logic to gather actions from other players in round t-1) ...
  // For round t, decide action based on previous round's outcome
  my_action = DecideAction(t, actions_from_round_t_minus_1)
  // ... (submit my_action) ...
```

**Robustness and Adaptability:**

*   **Adaptability:** The strategy directly reacts to the observed cooperation rate of the group. If the group starts cooperating more, ART will follow suit. If the group starts defecting, ART will eventually defect as well.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   It doesn't require any specific assumptions about other players' strategies beyond their observable actions.
    *   It can handle scenarios where a few players defect, as long as the majority continues to cooperate.
    *   It is robust to pure defection strategies, as it will eventually defect if the cooperation rate consistently falls below the threshold.
    *   It is also robust to pure cooperation strategies, by continuing to cooperate as long as the group does.

This ART strategy aims to strike a balance between being altruistic enough to initiate and sustain cooperation, and rational enough to protect itself from exploitation in a repeated, anonymous setting.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_75 = '''
This N-Player Public Goods Game presents a classic social dilemma. While individual rationality in a single round would lead to defection (as the private return from contributing is less than the cost of contributing, and the benefit of others contributing is shared), the repeated nature of the game opens the door for cooperation through strategic reciprocity.

Here's a cooperative strategy designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Adaptive Threshold (TFT-AT)

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a mechanism to recover from periods of low cooperation.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Be Nice:** Start by cooperating. This signals a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial cooperation.
2.  **Reciprocate:** Respond to opponents' actions. If they cooperate, you cooperate. If they defect, you defect (at least initially).
3.  **Forgive (Eventually):** While punishing defection, don't hold grudges indefinitely. If a period of defection ends, and cooperation resumes, be willing to return to cooperation.
4.  **Adapt to Group Behavior:** The strategy is sensitive to the overall level of cooperation in the group, not just the actions of any single opponent. This makes it robust to diverse opponent behaviors.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in a given round `t` is based on two main factors:

*   **The overall cooperation level in the previous round:** We track the proportion of players who cooperated in round `t-1`.
*   **A dynamic "cooperation threshold":** This threshold represents the minimum expected proportion of cooperators in the group that we believe is necessary for our own cooperation to be beneficial.

**Specifically:**

*   **In Round `t > 1`:**
    *   Calculate `P_coop_t-1`: The proportion of players who played C in round `t-1`.
    *   Calculate `C_threshold_t`: A dynamically adjusted threshold. This threshold is *lowered* if cooperation is generally high in previous rounds and *raised* if cooperation has been low.
    *   **If `P_coop_t-1 >= C_threshold_t`:** Play **C** (Cooperate).
    *   **If `P_coop_t-1 < C_threshold_t`:** Play **D** (Defect).

*   **Initial `C_threshold_1`:** Set to a slightly higher value than the "sucker's payoff" threshold. A good starting point would be `k/n`. This means if the average payoff from cooperating is less than the average payoff from defecting for the group, we lean towards defecting. However, we'll start by cooperating to test the waters.

**Dynamic Adjustment of `C_threshold`:**

The `C_threshold` will adapt based on the observed group behavior. This is the core of the "adaptive" nature.

*   **If `P_coop_t-1` was high (e.g., > 0.75, or a predefined "high cooperation" percentage):**
    *   We are encouraged by sustained cooperation.
    *   Lower `C_threshold_t` slightly. This makes it easier for us to continue cooperating in the next round, as we become more tolerant of slightly lower group cooperation levels.
    *   `C_threshold_t = max(k/n, C_threshold_{t-1} - adjustment_factor)` (where `adjustment_factor` is a small positive value, e.g., 0.05). We ensure the threshold doesn't go below `k/n` because that's the minimum group cooperation needed to break even on average when contributing.

*   **If `P_coop_t-1` was low (e.g., < 0.25, or a predefined "low cooperation" percentage):**
    *   We are discouraged by sustained defection.
    *   Raise `C_threshold_t` slightly. This makes it harder for us to cooperate in the next round, as we require a higher level of observed cooperation before we risk contributing again.
    *   `C_threshold_t = min(1.0, C_threshold_{t-1} + adjustment_factor)` (where `adjustment_factor` is a small positive value, e.g., 0.05). We cap the threshold at 1.0.

*   **If `P_coop_t-1` is in the middle range:**
    *   The `C_threshold` remains stable or changes very slightly.
    *   `C_threshold_t = C_threshold_{t-1}`

**Why this adjustment?**

*   **Encouraging Cooperation:** When the group is cooperating well, we want to reinforce that by continuing to cooperate and making it easier for us to stay cooperative. Lowering the threshold signals "I'm willing to keep cooperating even if a few people slip."
*   **Deterring Defection:** When the group is defecting heavily, we need to protect ourselves. Raising the threshold signals "I need to see more cooperation from you before I contribute again. Your defection is too costly for me to ignore."
*   **Forgiveness:** The strategy doesn't permanently punish. If a period of low cooperation is followed by a resurgence, the lowered threshold (from previous high cooperation phases) can help re-initiate cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t=1`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **C** (Cooperate).
    *   **Rationale:** This is the "niceness" principle. It's crucial to initiate cooperation. If we start by defecting, we might trigger an immediate cascade of defection and miss out on potential cooperation altogether.
    *   **`C_threshold_1` Initialization:** As mentioned, `C_threshold_1 = k/n`. This is our baseline for when cooperation becomes individually rational *on average*.

*   **Last Round (`t=r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **D** (Defect).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence. The game becomes a one-shot game. In a one-shot public goods game, the dominant strategy for every rational player is to defect, as there is no incentive to build trust or punish past behavior. This is the "end-game problem" in repeated games.
    *   **Exception:** If the strategy is designed to be "perfectly cooperative" and not exploit the end game, it would continue to play C. However, for maximizing one's own payoff in a tournament setting where other strategies might exploit this, defecting in the last round is the rational choice according to standard game theory. *For this cooperative strategy, we will stick to defection in the last round to maximize individual payoff.*

*   **Initial History:** The strategy is designed to be adaptive from round 1, but its full power emerges as it observes group behavior. The initial `C_threshold` and the decision to cooperate in round 1 set the stage.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its design.

*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** It always starts by offering cooperation, creating an opportunity for mutually beneficial outcomes.
*   **Reward for Cooperation:** It directly reciprocates cooperation, reinforcing positive behavior and leading to higher group payoffs when sustained.
*   **Adaptive Punishment:** While it punishes defection, this punishment is not vindictive. It's a strategic tool to incentivize a return to cooperation and protect oneself from exploitation. The "forgiveness" aspect comes from the `C_threshold` adjustment – if the group's behavior improves, the strategy becomes more amenable to cooperating again.
*   **Focus on Group State:** By reacting to the overall group cooperation level (`P_coop_t-1`), it implicitly aims for higher collective payoffs. If the group is cooperating, everyone benefits. If it's not, the strategy adjusts to protect itself while still being open to future cooperation.

Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust, while adhering to the specified constraints.

## Strategy Name: Reciprocal Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness (RTF)

**Core Philosophy:** The strategy aims to foster and maintain cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a mechanism for re-establishing cooperation after a period of sustained defection. It balances the desire for personal gain with the understanding that collective cooperation leads to higher overall payoffs.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round `t` is based on the observed behavior of *all* players in the *previous* round `t-1`.

*   **Initial Cooperation (Round 1):** Always Cooperate. This is the foundational assumption for building trust and demonstrating a cooperative intent.
*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **If ALL other players cooperated in round `t-1`:** **Cooperate** in round `t`. This rewards consistent cooperative behavior.
    *   **If AT LEAST ONE other player defected in round `t-1`:** **Defect** in round `t`. This signals disapproval of defection and attempts to deter future defections.
    *   **However, there's a twist: Forgiveness.** If a player has defected in the *current* round, they will **Cooperate** in the *next* round (`t+1`) *if* all other players *also* defected in round `t`. This prevents an endless cycle of mutual defection.

**To summarize the logic for round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

Let `N_cooperators(t-1)` be the total number of players who cooperated in round `t-1`.
Let `N_defecters(t-1)` be the total number of players who defected in round `t-1`.

*   **If `N_defecters(t-1) == 0` (i.e., everyone cooperated in `t-1`):** Play **C** in round `t`.
*   **If `N_defecters(t-1) > 0` AND `N_cooperators(t-1) == n-1` (i.e., only one player defected in `t-1`):** Play **D** in round `t`. This is a direct response to the single defector.
*   **If `N_defecters(t-1) > 0` AND `N_cooperators(t-1) < n-1` (i.e., multiple players defected in `t-1`):**
    *   **Check for recent history:** Look at round `t-2`. If *everyone* defected in `t-2` *and* you are now facing multiple defecters again in `t-1`, then it suggests a breakdown in cooperation. In this specific scenario, to break the cycle, **Cooperate** in round `t`.
    *   **Otherwise (if `t-2` wasn't a universal defection, or if this is the first instance of multiple defections):** Play **D** in round `t`.

**Refined Decision Rule for `t > 1`:**

Let `actions(t-1)` be the list of actions played by all players in round `t-1`.
Let `my_action(t-1)` be my action in round `t-1`.

1.  **If `actions(t-1)` contains only 'C' for all players:** Play **C**.
2.  **If `actions(t-1)` contains at least one 'D':**
    *   **Check for a "mutual defection reset" condition:**
        *   If `t >= 3` (to have `t-2` history) AND `actions(t-2)` contained only 'D' for all players AND `actions(t-1)` contains at least one 'D': Play **C**. This is the forgiveness mechanism.
    *   **Otherwise (standard punishment or initial defection response):** Play **D**.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (r=1):** Always Cooperate. This is the starting point, aiming to establish a cooperative norm.
*   **Last Round (r):** In the last round, there's no future to incentivize. This is where pure self-interest might take over.
    *   **If `r` is the last round:** **Defect**. The reasoning is that there's no longer any strategic benefit to cooperating, as there are no future rounds to benefit from reciprocal cooperation. The payoff in the last round is solely determined by this round's actions. Since `k < n`, the individual payoff from defecting when others cooperate is always higher than cooperating when others cooperate, and defecting when others defect is better than cooperating when others defect.
*   **General History Dependency:** The strategy relies on the history of actions from *all* players. This is crucial for its adaptive and reciprocal nature. If the game is very short (e.g., r=2), the "mutual defection reset" will not trigger.

### 3. Be Cooperative:

The strategy is fundamentally cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It always starts by signaling a desire for collective gain.
*   **Reciprocity:** It actively rewards observed cooperation from others.
*   **Punishment for Defection:** It punishes defection to deter free-riding and maintain the integrity of the cooperative system.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** The "mutual defection reset" is a key cooperative element. It prevents a downward spiral into mutual defection when cooperation breaks down. Instead, it offers a chance to restart cooperation even after a period of widespread defection. This is crucial for long-term potential cooperation.
*   **Maximizing Joint Payoff:** While defecting in the last round is individually rational, the strategy prioritizes building and maintaining cooperation in all preceding rounds, which generally leads to higher *total* payoffs for *all* players over the course of the game, given `1 < k < n`.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
strategy RTF(game_history, current_round, total_rounds):
  // game_history: a list of lists, where each inner list contains actions of all players in a round.
  // current_round: the current round number (1-indexed).
  // total_rounds: the total number of rounds (r).

  if current_round == 1:
    return "C" // Always cooperate in the first round.

  if current_round == total_rounds:
    return "D" // Always defect in the last round.

  // For rounds t > 1 and t < r:

  previous_round_actions = game_history[current_round - 2] // Actions from round t-1
  all_cooperated_previous = True
  for action in previous_round_actions:
    if action == "D":
      all_cooperated_previous = False
      break

  if all_cooperated_previous:
    return "C" // Reward full cooperation.

  else:
    // At least one player defected in the previous round.
    // Check for the forgiveness condition (mutual defection reset).
    if current_round >= 3: // Need at least t-2 history
      round_t_minus_2_actions = game_history[current_round - 3] // Actions from round t-2
      all_defected_t_minus_2 = True
      for action in round_t_minus_2_actions:
        if action == "C":
          all_defected_t_minus_2 = False
          break

      if all_defected_t_minus_2:
        // If everyone defected in t-2 AND at least one defected in t-1, try to reset.
        return "C"

    // Otherwise, punish defection.
    return "D"

Here's a design for a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptiveness and robustness:

## Strategy Name: Generous Tit-for-Tat (GTFT)

This strategy is designed to be inherently cooperative while incorporating a forgiving mechanism to adapt to defections. It aims to foster cooperation by initially assuming the best and only retaliating when necessary, but quickly returning to cooperation if the opponent(s) do.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of GTFT is a "tit-for-tat" approach but with a higher threshold for retaliation and a quicker return to cooperation.

*   **Initial Round (Round 1):** Always cooperate (play C). The assumption is that everyone will try to cooperate initially in a repeated game, and leading by example is the best way to establish cooperation.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **If the average contribution in the *previous* round was "sufficiently high":** Play C.
    *   **Otherwise:** Play D.

**Defining "Sufficiently High":**

This is the adaptive and robust element. Instead of a strict threshold, we'll use a dynamic measure based on the game's parameters and observed behavior.

*   **Target Cooperation Rate:** We aim for a situation where the total payoff per player is maximized. In a purely cooperative scenario (all play C), each player gets `(k/n) * n = k`. In a purely defective scenario (all play D), each player gets `1`. Since `1 < k < n`, cooperation is collectively beneficial. The optimal number of cooperators for *each player's* payoff would be such that their individual payoff `(1-c_i) + (k/n) * Σc_j` is maximized.
    *   If `c_i = 1` (cooperate), payoff is `0 + (k/n) * Σc_j`.
    *   If `c_i = 0` (defect), payoff is `1 + (k/n) * Σc_j`.
    *   A player is indifferent when `(k/n) * Σc_j = 1 + (k/n) * Σc_j`, which simplifies to `1 = 0` - this is impossible.
    *   However, the *social optimum* (maximizing total payoff for all players) occurs when everyone cooperates, yielding a total payoff of `n * k`. If everyone defects, total payoff is `n * 1`. Since `k > 1`, cooperation is always socially optimal.
    *   For an individual player, playing C is better than playing D *if and only if* `(k/n) * Σc_j > 1`. This means if the total number of cooperators is greater than `n/k`, then cooperating benefits the individual.

*   **GTFT Threshold Logic:**
    *   Let `avg_c_prev_round` be the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round.
    *   We will cooperate if `avg_c_prev_round >= (n/k) / n` (i.e., if the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was at least `1/k`). This is derived from the condition `Σc_j > n/k`.
    *   **Refinement for Robustness:** To avoid excessive punishment and be more "generous," we will introduce a slight tolerance. We will cooperate if `avg_c_prev_round >= (1/k) - epsilon`, where `epsilon` is a small positive value (e.g., `0.05` or `0.1`). This means we are willing to tolerate a slightly lower proportion of cooperators than strictly necessary for individual gain, before defecting.
    *   **However, if we have defected in the previous round, we will defect again in the current round UNLESS the average cooperation rate in the previous round was *very high* (e.g., `avg_c_prev_round > 0.9`).** This creates a "cooling-off" period after defection and prevents immediate cascade into mutual defection.

**In summary, for rounds t > 1:**

*   Calculate `avg_c_prev_round`, the proportion of players who played C in round `t-1`.
*   **If `avg_c_prev_round >= (1/k) - epsilon`:** Play C. (This is the cooperative default).
*   **Else (if `avg_c_prev_round < (1/k) - epsilon`):** Play D. (This is the retaliatory action).

**Addendum to the "Else" condition for robustness:**

*   Even if `avg_c_prev_round < (1/k) - epsilon`, if we ourselves defected in the *previous* round (`t-1`), we will *still* play D in the current round (`t`). This maintains a consistent response to observed defection. The *only* way to return to cooperation after a period of defection is if the *overall* group behavior shifts back significantly above our tolerance threshold.

### 2. Handle Edge Cases

*   **First Round (r=1):** As stated above, **always Cooperate (C)**. This is the foundational cooperative move.

*   **Last Round (r):** In the last round, the incentive to cooperate disappears as there are no future rounds to benefit from continued cooperation. Therefore, in the absolute last round (`t=r`), **always Defect (D)**. This is a rational strategy given the game's structure and the absence of future consequences.

*   **One Player vs. `n-1` Others:** The strategy is designed to be robust. It reacts to the *aggregate* behavior of the group. If the majority of others cooperate, `avg_c_prev_round` will be high, and GTFT will cooperate. If they defect, `avg_c_prev_round` will be low, and GTFT will defect in response.

*   **N-1 Players Cooperate, One Defects:** GTFT will observe a high `avg_c_prev_round` and cooperate, assuming the defector was an anomaly.

*   **One Player Cooperates, N-1 Defect:** GTFT will observe a low `avg_c_prev_round` and defect in retaliation, aligning with the majority and protecting its endowment.

### 3. Be Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It starts with an act of trust and willingness to contribute.
*   **Forgiving Nature:** The `epsilon` buffer means it's more tolerant of minor deviations from perfect cooperation than a strict tit-for-tat. It requires a sustained period of low cooperation before it retaliates, and it's quick to return to cooperation if the group's behavior improves.
*   **Maximizing Collective Benefit:** The underlying logic `avg_c_prev_round >= (1/k) - epsilon` is geared towards maintaining a level of cooperation that is collectively beneficial for the group.
*   **Not Predatory:** It does not seek to exploit or punish others disproportionately. It retaliates only when cooperation levels drop significantly, aiming to bring the group back to a more mutually beneficial state.

### Pseudocode

```
// Strategy: Generous Tit-for-Tat (GTFT)

// Parameters:
// n: number of players
// r: number of rounds
// k: multiplication factor
// epsilon: small tolerance for forgiveness (e.g., 0.05)

// State variables to track history:
// total_cooperators_prev_round = 0

function decide_action(current_round, history_of_actions):
    // history_of_actions is a list of lists, where history_of_actions[t-1] is a list of actions (C/D) for round t-1

    if current_round == 1:
        // Always cooperate in the first round
        return "C"

    if current_round == r:
        // Always defect in the last round
        return "D"

    // Calculate average cooperation rate from the previous round
    if current_round > 1:
        actions_prev_round = history_of_actions[current_round - 2] // 0-indexed history
        num_cooperators_prev_round = count("C" in actions_prev_round)
        avg_c_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round / n
    else:
        // Should not happen if current_round > 1, but for completeness
        avg_c_prev_round = 1.0 // Assume full cooperation if no history

    // Define our threshold for cooperation
    cooperation_threshold = (1.0 / k) - epsilon

    // Check if the previous round's cooperation was sufficient to warrant cooperation
    if avg_c_prev_round >= cooperation_threshold:
        return "C"
    else:
        // If cooperation was insufficient, defect
        return "D"

// Note: The 'history_of_actions' would need to be maintained externally and passed to this function.
// The strategy is adaptive because it looks at the group's past behavior.
// It's robust because it doesn't rely on specific players' behavior, only the aggregate.
// It's cooperative by starting with C and having a high bar for sustained defection.

description_COOPERATIVE_78 = '''
This is a fascinating N-Player Public Goods Game, and designing a cooperative strategy requires careful consideration of the incentives and the repeated nature of the game. The core challenge is to encourage cooperation despite the inherent incentive for individual defection to achieve a higher immediate payoff.

Here's a proposed cooperative strategy, designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with a Forgiveness Factor and Gradual Escalation (TFT-FFGE)

This strategy builds upon the well-known "Tit-for-Tat" principle but incorporates mechanisms to foster long-term cooperation and adapt to varying levels of defection.

### Core Cooperative Principle:

The overarching goal is to achieve the highest possible payoff by encouraging widespread cooperation. This strategy aims to signal a willingness to cooperate, reward cooperation, and punish defection, but with a degree of flexibility to avoid getting stuck in cycles of mutual defection.

---

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` is based on the observed behavior of other players in the previous round `t-1`.

**Decision Logic for Player `i` in Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

*   **If all other players cooperated in round `t-1`:**
    *   **Cooperate (C).** This rewards consistent cooperative behavior.

*   **If some, but not all, other players defected in round `t-1`:**
    *   **Cooperate (C) with probability `p_coop`.** The probability `p_coop` is a function of the number of cooperators in the previous round.
    *   `p_coop = 1 - (number_of_defectors_in_t-1 / (n-1)) * forgiveness_factor`
        *   `number_of_defectors_in_t-1`: The count of players (excluding player `i`) who defected in round `t-1`.
        *   `forgiveness_factor`: A parameter between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.3). This factor determines how much we "forgive" minor defections. A higher factor means more leniency.

*   **If all other players defected in round `t-1`:**
    *   **Defect (D) with probability `p_defect`.** The probability `p_defect` is a function of how many rounds we've experienced full defection.
    *   `p_defect = 1 - (1 / (escalation_threshold - current_full_defection_streak))`
        *   `escalation_threshold`: A parameter representing the number of consecutive rounds of all-player defection before we switch to a pure defection strategy (e.g., 5 rounds).
        *   `current_full_defection_streak`: The number of consecutive rounds where *all* players (including potentially player `i` in previous rounds if they also defected) defected. This counter resets if even one player cooperates.
    *   **If `current_full_defection_streak` reaches `escalation_threshold`:** **Defect (D) permanently.** This signifies a complete breakdown of cooperation.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Cooperate (C).** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative and potentially beneficial starting move is to signal willingness to cooperate. This is a standard starting point for many cooperative strategies.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. Therefore, individual rationality dictates defection to maximize personal payoff. This is a critical realization for any repeated game strategy to avoid being exploited in the final round.

*   **Full Defection Streak Reaches Threshold:**
    *   As described in the decision rules, if a predefined `escalation_threshold` of consecutive rounds of universal defection is reached, the strategy permanently switches to **Defect (D)**. This is a "break glass in case of emergency" scenario where the game has demonstrably failed to sustain cooperation.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Initial Cooperative Stance:** The strategy begins by cooperating, sending a clear signal of a cooperative intent.
*   **Reciprocity:** The core of the strategy is based on reciprocity. It rewards cooperation by cooperating back and punishes defection by defecting back.
*   **Forgiveness Factor:** The `forgiveness_factor` is a crucial element that prevents the strategy from falling into immediate retaliatory cycles. It allows for a certain degree of tolerance for occasional defections from others, which can be more robust in scenarios where individual defections might be accidental or part of a more complex emergent strategy. This is particularly important in an N-player game where not everyone might be playing the same strategy.
*   **Gradual Escalation:** Instead of immediately switching to permanent defection upon the first instance of widespread defection, the strategy employs a gradual escalation. This allows for the possibility of recovery if the widespread defection was temporary or a miscalculation. Only after a sustained period of universal defection does it concede to permanent defection.
*   **Alignment with Cooperative Mindset:** The strategy's design directly prioritizes mutual gain through cooperation. It assumes that cooperation, when sustained, leads to higher collective payoffs for everyone involved. Its punitive measures are not malicious but are designed to steer the group back towards a mutually beneficial cooperative equilibrium.

    if random_value <= cooperation_probability:
      return C
    else:
      return D
  else: // num_defectors_last_round == total_players_observed (all others defected)
    current_full_defection_streak = current_full_defection_streak + 1

    if current_full_defection_streak >= escalation_threshold:
      // Sustained universal defection, give up on cooperation
      return D
    else:
      // Still in the escalation phase, consider defecting but not permanently
      // Probability of defection increases with the streak length.
      // The formula below gives a higher chance of defection as streak grows.
      defect_probability = 1 - (1 / (escalation_threshold - current_full_defection_streak + 1)) // +1 to ensure prob is less than 1

      random_value = random_float(0, 1)
      if random_value <= defect_probability:
        return D
      else:
        return C // Chance to recover and not get stuck in defection cycle


// --- Update State after each round ---
// After each round 't', update round_t and store actions:
// my_last_action = decision made by this strategy in round t
// last_round_actions = observed actions of ALL players in round t (including my_last_action)
// If all players (including myself) defected in round t, increment current_full_defection_streak.
// If at least one player cooperated in round t, reset current_full_defection_streak = 0.
```

---

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Adaptive Response to Defection:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its cooperation probability based on the observed defection rate in the previous round, modulated by the `forgiveness_factor`. This allows it to be flexible in response to varying opponent behaviors.
*   **Resistance to Exploitation:** The gradual escalation mechanism prevents the strategy from being easily exploited by a few initial defections. It requires sustained, widespread defection to trigger a more aggressive response.
*   **Potential for Recovery:** The probabilistic defection when facing some defection, and the possibility of cooperating even when facing widespread defection (before the escalation threshold), offer opportunities to pull the group back to cooperation.
*   **No Reliance on External Norms:** The strategy's decisions are solely based on game parameters and the history of play, making it self-contained and independent of any assumed external coordination.
*   **Simultaneous Move Consideration:** The strategy is designed for simultaneous moves, as it bases its decision on the *previous* round's outcomes, which were also simultaneous.

This TFT-FFGE strategy aims to be a resilient and principled cooperative agent in the N-Player Public Goods Game, capable of fostering cooperation while safeguarding against outright exploitation.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_79 = '''
Here's a strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on cooperation while being adaptive and robust. This strategy aims to maximize its own total payoff by encouraging mutual cooperation, but can defend against exploitation.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Reciprocity with Punishment and Forgiveness"

This strategy is based on the principle of reciprocity: reward cooperation and punish defection. However, it incorporates elements to encourage a return to cooperation after periods of defection and to handle the unique dynamics of the final round.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core decision for player `i` in round `t` is:

*   **Cooperate (C) if:** The estimated likelihood of a "good outcome" (where most players cooperate) in the current round is high enough. This likelihood is assessed based on the observed behavior of other players in previous rounds, with a strong emphasis on the immediate past.

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   The observed rate of cooperation in recent rounds has dropped significantly, suggesting that the group is trending towards defection.
    *   A sustained period of defection from a significant portion of other players has occurred, indicating a lack of reciprocal cooperation.
    *   It is the final round of the game.

**Detailed Decision Logic:**

1.  **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, always cooperate. This signals a desire for cooperation and provides a baseline for future actions.

2.  **Reciprocity Metric (RM):** For each round `t > 1`, calculate a "Reciprocity Metric" (RM_t). This metric will reflect the average cooperation observed in the *previous* round (t-1).
    *   `RM_t = (Number of cooperators in round t-1) / n`

3.  **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** Define a threshold that represents the minimum level of cooperation needed to justify further cooperation. This threshold should be informed by the game parameters. A good starting point is related to the `k/n` factor. If `k/n` is high, it's more beneficial for the group to cooperate. Conversely, if `k/n` is low, individual defection is less punishing to others.
    *   Let's define a baseline `CT_base`. A reasonable value for `CT_base` could be slightly above the break-even point for an individual playing C when the rest defect. In our payoff formula, if player `i` plays C, they get `(k/n) * total_contributions`. If `total_contributions` is `n-1` (everyone else defects), player `i` gets `(k/n) * (n-1)`. They keep `0` from their endowment. For them to break even compared to defecting (where they keep `1`), `(k/n) * (n-1)` should be close to `1`.
    *   A more robust `CT` can be dynamically adjusted, but for simplicity and clarity, we can consider a fixed threshold based on `k/n`. For example, `CT = 0.5 + (k/n) * 0.2`. This gives a base of 0.5 (50% cooperation) and increases it slightly based on how beneficial cooperation is. The exact value can be tuned in simulations. For this description, let's use a simplified adaptive threshold:
    *   `CT_t = max(0.3, min(0.8, 0.5 + (k/n) * 0.3 - (average_defection_punishment_count / n) * 0.1))`
        *   `0.3` and `0.8` are bounds to prevent extreme thresholds.
        *   `(k/n) * 0.3` makes cooperation more likely when `k/n` is high.
        *   `(average_defection_punishment_count / n) * 0.1` is a mechanism to slightly lower the threshold if players are consistently punished for defecting, encouraging them to return to cooperation. We'll define `average_defection_punishment_count` later.

4.  **Punishment Trigger (PT):** Define a threshold for how much observed defection triggers a more punitive response.
    *   `PT = max(0.4, 0.7 - (k/n) * 0.2)`
        *   `0.4` is a lower bound.
        *   `0.7 - (k/n) * 0.2` means we tolerate more defection if `k/n` is low.

5.  **Cooperation Decision in Round `t` (for t > 1):**
    *   **If `RM_t >= CT_t`:** Cooperate. The group is cooperating well enough.
    *   **Else if `RM_t < PT`:** Defect. The group is cooperating too little, and it's time to signal strong disapproval and protect personal endowment.
    *   **Else (i.e., `PT <= RM_t < CT_t`):** This is the "grey area." Here, we employ a strategy that tries to encourage a return to cooperation without immediately defecting. We will look at the *trend* of cooperation.
        *   If cooperation has been increasing in the last 2 rounds (i.e., `RM_t > RM_{t-1}` and `RM_{t-1} > RM_{t-2}` for `t > 2`), then **Cooperate**. This suggests a positive momentum.
        *   Otherwise, **Defect**. This signals that the gradual decline in cooperation is not reversing.

**History Tracking (for adaptive thresholds and trend analysis):**

*   `cooperation_history`: A list of the number of cooperators in each past round.
*   `defection_punishment_count`: A counter for how many times *this player* has defected in response to sustained group defection. This is to avoid permanent punishment and encourage forgiveness if cooperation returns.
*   `opponent_cooperation_rates`: A list for each opponent, tracking their cooperation rate over the last few rounds. (Optional for simplicity, but enhances robustness).

**Refinement for Grey Area and Forgiveness:**

Let's refine the grey area decision and introduce forgiveness:

*   **If `RM_t >= CT_t`:** Cooperate.
*   **Else if `RM_t < PT`:** Defect. Increment `defection_punishment_count`.
*   **Else (`PT <= RM_t < CT_t`):**
    *   **Check Trend:** If `t > 2` and `cooperation_history[t-1] > cooperation_history[t-2]` and `cooperation_history[t-2] > cooperation_history[t-3]`: **Cooperate**. (Positive trend).
    *   **Check for Forgiveness:** If `defection_punishment_count > 0` and `RM_t >= CT_t * 0.9` (slightly below the main threshold but improving): **Cooperate**. This allows for forgiveness if the group is showing *some* signs of returning to cooperation after a punishment phase. Reset `defection_punishment_count = 0`.
    *   **Otherwise:** Defect. Increment `defection_punishment_count`.

**`average_defection_punishment_count` for Threshold Adjustment:**

This is the average number of times *this player* has defected due to punishment over the last `min(r/2, 5)` rounds. This slowly reduces the cooperation threshold if the player has been forced to defect repeatedly, making it easier to return to cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1:** **Always Cooperate (C)**. This sets a cooperative tone and establishes a baseline for observation.
*   **Last Round (`t = r`):** **Always Defect (D)**. In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. The rational choice for each player is to maximize their individual payoff by keeping their endowment, as there are no subsequent rounds to be punished or rewarded. This is a classic result in repeated game theory where the end of the game unravels cooperation.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative by:

*   **Prioritizing Cooperation:** It starts with cooperation and only defects when there's a clear and sustained trend of others defecting.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation from others with its own cooperation.
*   **Encouraging Return:** It includes mechanisms (like the forgiveness check and trend analysis) to re-establish cooperation even after periods of defection.
*   **Parameter-Driven Thresholds:** The cooperation and punishment thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on the game parameters (`k/n`) and observed behavior, ensuring it's not just a rigid rule set but adapts to the specific game environment.
*   **Punishment as a Tool, Not a Goal:** Defection is a response to perceived exploitation, a tool to incentivize others to return to a mutually beneficial cooperative state, rather than an end in itself.

Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but it also includes a mechanism to return to cooperation if the environment becomes more favorable. It's based on the principle of "tit-for-tat" but extended to a multi-player, repeated game context.

### Core Principle:

The fundamental idea is to start cooperatively and then mirror the *average* behavior of the group in the previous round. If the group, on average, cooperates, we will cooperate. If they, on average, defect, we will defect. This allows us to adapt to the prevailing behavior without explicit communication.

### 1. Decision Rules:

**Round t (where t > 1):**

*   **Calculate the average cooperation rate in round t-1:**
    Let $C_{t-1}$ be the total number of players who played 'C' in round t-1.
    Average Cooperation Rate in round t-1 = $ACR_{t-1} = \frac{C_{t-1}}{n}$

*   **Decision for round t:**
    *   **If $ACR_{t-1} \ge \alpha$:** Play **C** (Cooperate).
    *   **If $ACR_{t-1} < \alpha$:** Play **D** (Defect).

    Here, $\alpha$ is a **threshold parameter**. This parameter represents the minimum level of group cooperation required for us to *initiate* or *continue* cooperation. A value slightly above 0.5 is a good starting point, suggesting we need a majority of players to cooperate for us to also cooperate. Let's set $\alpha = 0.6$ as a sensible default, implying we need at least 60% of players to cooperate to reward that behavior.

**Explanation of $\alpha$:**
*   Choosing $\alpha$ slightly above 0.5 makes the strategy less susceptible to being tricked by temporary dips in cooperation. It requires a more sustained period of cooperation from the group to trigger our cooperation.
*   A higher $\alpha$ would make us more cautious and more likely to defect. A lower $\alpha$ would make us more trusting. $0.6$ strikes a balance for general robustness.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision for round 1:** Always play **C** (Cooperate).
    *   **Rationale:** To initiate cooperation and signal a cooperative intent. In a repeated game, starting cooperatively is the best way to *potentially* achieve a cooperative outcome, especially if others are also inclined towards it.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision for round r:** Play **D** (Defect).
    *   **Rationale:** This is a standard grim trigger-like element in repeated games with a finite horizon. Since there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation, the rational choice for each player in the last round is to defect, as there's no future punishment for doing so. To be robust and maximize individual payoff in the very last round, we defect.

*   **Subsequent rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   Apply the decision rules outlined in section 1.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative in its *intent* and *initial action*.

*   **Initiation:** It always starts with cooperation in the first round, hoping to foster it.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards observed group cooperation by cooperating itself.
*   **Adaptability:** It's not blindly cooperative. If the group consistently defects, it will also defect, thus protecting its own endowment. However, it remains open to returning to cooperation if the group's behavior shifts.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Strategy: Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness

// Parameters
n: number of players
r: number of rounds
k: multiplication factor
alpha: cooperation threshold (e.g., 0.6)

// State (history of actions for each player)
// history_of_actions[round_number][player_index] = 'C' or 'D'

function DecideAction(current_round, history_of_actions):
    // Edge Case: First Round
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'

    // Edge Case: Last Round
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'

    // Normal Rounds (1 < t < r)
    
    // Get actions from the previous round (t-1)
    previous_round_actions = history_of_actions[current_round - 1]
    
    // Count cooperators in the previous round
    num_cooperators_prev_round = 0
    for player_action in previous_round_actions:
        if player_action == 'C':
            num_cooperators_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round + 1

    // Calculate average cooperation rate in the previous round
    average_cooperation_rate = num_cooperators_prev_round / n

    // Decision rule
    if average_cooperation_rate >= alpha:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

```

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Robustness to Defection:** If a few players defect, the average cooperation rate might dip, but if it doesn't fall below `alpha`, this strategy will continue to cooperate. This prevents it from collapsing into defection due to minor deviations.
*   **Adaptability to Group Behavior:** If the majority of players start cooperating consistently, the average cooperation rate will rise above `alpha`, and this strategy will join in. Conversely, if the group starts defecting consistently, the average cooperation rate will fall below `alpha`, and this strategy will switch to defecting, minimizing losses.
*   **Forgiveness:** While the last round is a hard defection, the "forgiveness" comes from the fact that if a period of defection occurs but then the group starts cooperating again (raising the average above `alpha`), this strategy will revert to cooperation. It doesn't hold grudges indefinitely.

This strategy aims to create a stable environment for cooperation while protecting itself from exploitation. Its success will depend on the specific behaviors of other AI strategies in the tournament.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_81 = '''
Here's a strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, aiming for cooperation while being adaptive and robust. This strategy is based on the principle of reciprocal altruism, often seen in repeated game theory as "tit-for-tat" but adapted for a public goods setting.

## Cooperative Reciprocity Strategy

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding past cooperation and punishing past defection, while also being forgiving to encourage the re-establishment of cooperative norms.

### Core Principle: Reciprocal Altruism

The core idea is to **cooperate if the group generally cooperated in the previous round, and defect if the group generally defected**. However, we need to be more nuanced to be robust and handle imperfect information or a mix of behaviors.

### 1. Decision Rules

**For any round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   The average contribution in the previous round (`t-1`) was sufficiently high. Specifically, if the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1` was greater than or equal to a **cooperation threshold**.
*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   The average contribution in the previous round (`t-1`) was too low. Specifically, if the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1` was below the **cooperation threshold**.

**Defining the Cooperation Threshold:**

The cooperation threshold is a crucial parameter. It represents the minimum level of group cooperation required to continue cooperating. Given the game parameters and the goal of fostering cooperation, a sensible threshold would be related to achieving a payoff that is at least as good as the pure defection payoff.

*   **Pure Defection Payoff:** If everyone defects, each player gets 1.
*   **Cooperative Payoff (Everyone Cooperates):** If everyone cooperates, each player gets $(k/n) \times n = k$. Since $1 < k < n$, this payoff is higher than the pure defection payoff.

To incentivize continued cooperation, we want to reach a state where the *average* player's payoff is higher than 1. This generally requires at least *some* cooperation. A good starting point for the cooperation threshold could be:

*   **Cooperation Threshold = $1/k$** (or a value close to it).
    *   *Rationale:* If more than $1/k$ players cooperate, the total contribution is $(n \times 1/k)$. The share of the public good for each player is $(k/n) \times (n \times 1/k) = 1$. So, if the fraction of cooperators is *greater* than $1/k$, the individual share of the public good *exceeds* 1, making cooperation potentially more rewarding than defecting (assuming you don't have to pay the endowment). If the fraction of cooperators is *less* than $1/k$, your share of the public good is less than 1. This threshold ensures that if the group is cooperating enough to make the public good contribution *individually* valuable (i.e., greater than or equal to the cost of your own endowment), you will reciprocate.

Let's refine this. A more direct way to link threshold to group payoff:
The total contribution is $\sum c_j$. Each cooperator receives $1 - 1 + (k/n) \sum c_j = (k/n) \sum c_j$. Each defector receives $1 - 0 + (k/n) \sum c_j = 1 + (k/n) \sum c_j$.
For cooperation to be beneficial *on average*, we'd want $(k/n) \sum c_j > 1$. This means $\sum c_j > n/k$.
So, the proportion of cooperators should be greater than $1/k$.

**Proposed Cooperation Threshold:** **`0.5` (or `50%`)**
*   *Rationale for `0.5`*: This is a simple, robust, and generally forgiving threshold. If at least half the players cooperated in the previous round, we will try to cooperate again. This allows for the re-establishment of cooperation even after periods of low cooperation, as long as the group can "pull itself up" to at least 50% cooperation. It's less prone to getting stuck in mutual defection if only one or two players defect initially.

**Refined Decision Rule for `t > 1`:**
*   Calculate `num_cooperators_prev_round` = number of players who played C in round `t-1`.
*   Calculate `proportion_cooperators_prev_round` = `num_cooperators_prev_round` / `n`.
*   **If `proportion_cooperators_prev_round` >= 0.5:** Play **C**.
*   **If `proportion_cooperators_prev_round` < 0.5:** Play **D**.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (`t=1`):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This is the initial state. Since there is no history, the most cooperative and optimistic approach is to initiate cooperation. This sets a positive example and aims to trigger reciprocal cooperation from others. It aligns with the "cooperative mindset" and provides an opportunity for the group to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.

*   **Last Round (`t=r`):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In a finitely repeated game with no future repercussions, the last round becomes a one-shot game. In a one-shot N-player public goods game, the dominant strategy for each player is to defect, regardless of past behavior, because there's no incentive to build trust or foster future cooperation. Therefore, playing D in the last round maximizes the individual payoff, assuming other players will also defect. This is a strategic adaptation to the end of the game.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is inherently cooperative because:

*   **It starts with cooperation:** The first round is always an act of trust and optimism.
*   **It rewards cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the group demonstrates a sufficient level of cooperation (>= 50%). This creates a positive feedback loop for cooperation.
*   **It is forgiving:** It doesn't punish a single defector indefinitely. If the group can recover to 50% cooperation, it will rejoin the cooperative effort. This allows for recovery from minor lapses in group cooperation.
*   **It only defects when necessary:** Defection is a response to insufficient group cooperation, not an arbitrary choice. It serves as a signal that the current level of cooperation is not sustainable for mutual benefit.

### Pseudocode Representation

```pseudocode
Strategy: CooperativeReciprocity

Parameters:
  n: number of players
  r: number of rounds
  k: multiplication factor (not directly used in decision logic, but understood)
  cooperation_threshold = 0.5

State (maintained across rounds):
  history_of_actions = []  // List of lists, where each inner list contains actions of all players in a round
  current_round = 1

Function decide_action(current_round, history_of_actions):

  // Handle Last Round
  if current_round == r:
    return D // Defect in the last round

  // Handle First Round
  if current_round == 1:
    return C // Cooperate in the first round

  // Handle Subsequent Rounds (t > 1 and t < r)
  else:
    // Get actions from the previous round
    previous_round_actions = history_of_actions[-1] // Last element in the history

    // Count cooperators in the previous round
    num_cooperators_prev_round = 0
    for player_action in previous_round_actions:
      if player_action == C:
        num_cooperators_prev_round += 1

    // Calculate proportion of cooperators
    proportion_cooperators_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round / n

    // Make decision based on threshold
    if proportion_cooperators_prev_round >= cooperation_threshold:
      return C // Cooperate if group cooperation was sufficient
    else:
      return D // Defect if group cooperation was insufficient

// To be called by the game engine:
// For round t:
//   my_action = decide_action(t, history_of_actions)
//   // Record my_action and other players' actions into history_of_actions
```

### Robustness and Adaptability

*   **Robustness:**
    *   It can handle a mix of strategies from opponents. If opponents consistently defect, the group's cooperation level will drop below the threshold, and this strategy will eventually defect, protecting its endowment.
    *   If opponents are mostly cooperative, this strategy will continue to cooperate and achieve high payoffs.
    *   It's not easily tricked by a few initial defectors as long as the majority can still bring the cooperation level up to 0.5.

*   **Adaptability:**
    *   The strategy adapts its behavior based on the collective behavior observed in the previous round. It doesn't follow a fixed pattern but responds dynamically to the state of the game.
    *   The choice of `cooperation_threshold = 0.5` can be considered a tunable parameter. While 0.5 is chosen for its robustness and forgiveness, in a tournament setting, one might experiment with slightly higher or lower thresholds to see what performs best against a diverse set of opponent strategies.

This strategy prioritizes achieving the high payoffs available through sustained cooperation while having a fallback mechanism to defect and protect itself from exploitation when cooperation falters.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_82 = '''
This strategy is designed to encourage cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defections, while aiming for overall high payoffs in a repeated setting. It balances the desire for immediate gains from defection with the long-term benefits of sustained cooperation.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Grudger with Threshold

**Core Principle:** The strategy aims to achieve the highest possible payoff by maximizing cooperation as long as it is reciprocated. It will defect only when it detects a significant deviation from cooperative norms, and it will consider returning to cooperation if sufficient cooperation is observed.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, the strategy will always cooperate (play C). This is to signal a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial cooperation.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** In subsequent rounds (t > 1), the strategy's decision depends on the observed actions of *all* other players in the previous round (t-1).
    *   **If all other players cooperated in the previous round (t-1):** Play C. This reinforces sustained cooperation.
    *   **If at least one other player defected in the previous round (t-1):**
        *   **Defection Threshold Check:** Calculate the proportion of players who defected in the previous round. Let this be `defection_rate_t-1 = (number of defectors in t-1) / (n-1)`.
        *   **If `defection_rate_t-1` is below a predefined threshold `T`:** Play D. This is a "grudging" response, punishing the defection by defecting yourself. The idea is that a single defector shouldn't derail cooperation for everyone.
        *   **If `defection_rate_t-1` is at or above the threshold `T`:** Play D. This indicates a widespread breakdown of cooperation, making further individual cooperation less beneficial and potentially exploitative.
*   **Reintroduction of Cooperation (Adaptive Element):** If the strategy has been defecting for some consecutive rounds, it will periodically "test the waters" for renewed cooperation.
    *   **After `M` consecutive rounds of defection (where `M` is a parameter):** The strategy will temporarily switch to playing C for one round.
    *   **If, after this "test round" of cooperation, all other players *also* played C in that same round:** The strategy will return to its "Conditional Cooperation" rules from that point onwards.
    *   **If, after this "test round" of cooperation, at least one other player defected:** The strategy will resume its defection policy based on the "Conditional Cooperation" rules, and the `M` consecutive defection count will reset.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t = 1):** Always play C. This is a default cooperative stance.
*   **Last Round (t = r):** In the last round, there is no future to incentivize. The rational choice for a self-interested player is to defect, as there are no future round payoffs to be gained or lost by cooperating. Therefore, in the last round, the strategy will always play D.
*   **No History (Early Rounds):** The initial rounds before a full history is available are covered by the "Initial Cooperation" and then the "Conditional Cooperation" rules based on the *immediate* previous round's observed actions.

**3. Cooperativeness:**

*   **Emphasis on Mutual Gain:** The strategy is fundamentally designed to achieve high payoffs through sustained cooperation. It starts by cooperating and continues to do so as long as others reciprocate.
*   **Punishment as Deterrent:** Defection is used not for immediate personal gain in the long run (as that would be sub-optimal), but as a mechanism to punish and deter defection from others, aiming to restore a cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Forgiveness (Conditional):** The "Reintroduction of Cooperation" rule introduces an element of forgiveness. If a period of defection is followed by a successful cooperative "test round" where all others also cooperated, the strategy is willing to return to full cooperation, indicating a desire to re-establish mutually beneficial outcomes.

**Parameters and Their Rationale:**

*   **`T` (Defection Threshold):** This parameter determines how sensitive the strategy is to individual defections.
    *   **Low `T` (e.g., < 0.5):** More forgiving. The strategy will defect only if a majority of others defected. This is good for stabilizing cooperation against isolated defections.
    *   **High `T` (e.g., > 0.5):** Less forgiving. The strategy will defect even if only a minority of others defect. This is more aggressive but might lead to more frequent breakdowns of cooperation.
    *   **Recommended initial value:** `T = 0.5` (i.e., defect if 50% or more of others defected). This offers a balance between punishment and stability.
*   **`M` (Consecutive Defection Count for Testing):** This parameter controls how long the strategy will "hold a grudge" before attempting to re-establish cooperation.
    *   **Low `M`:** More persistent in defecting after a breakdown.
    *   **High `M`:** More eager to re-establish cooperation after a period of defection.
    *   **Recommended initial value:** `M = 3` (i.e., defect for 3 consecutive rounds before attempting to cooperate again). This provides a clear signal of displeasure but doesn't lock the strategy into endless defection.

description_COOPERATIVE_83 = '''
This is an interesting challenge! Designing a cooperative strategy in a repeated Public Goods Game with these parameters, especially without prior coordination, requires a careful balance of incentivizing cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

Here's a strategy designed to be cooperative, adaptive, and robust, aiming to foster mutual cooperation over time.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Generous Reciprocity with a Punishment Threshold"

This strategy is inspired by "Grim Trigger" but softens the punitive aspect to encourage re-establishment of cooperation. It aims to be generous initially, rewards sustained cooperation, and only defects when cooperation breaks down significantly, giving opportunities for recovery.

**Core Philosophy:** Start cooperative, reward consistent cooperation, and be willing to forgive a limited amount of defection if it leads back to cooperation.

---

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` depends on the history of cooperation, specifically the number of cooperators in the previous round `t-1`.

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the very first round (`t=1`), always play **Cooperate (C)**. This establishes a baseline of goodwill and provides an immediate positive payoff for all if others reciprocate.
*   **Sustained Cooperation:** If in the previous round (`t-1`), the number of cooperators was **greater than or equal to `n/2` (half the players)**, play **Cooperate (C)** in the current round `t`. This rewards consistent collective effort.
*   **Punishment Phase (Limited):** If in the previous round (`t-1`), the number of cooperators was **less than `n/2` but greater than 0**, play **Defect (D)** in the current round `t`. This signals disapproval of insufficient cooperation and aims to deter further defection by demonstrating a cost to the group.
*   **Full Defection (Breakdown):** If in the previous round (`t-1`), **no players cooperated (all defected)**, play **Defect (D)** in the current round `t`. This is the "punishment phase" where continued lack of cooperation leads to a stable, low-payoff equilibrium for everyone if not broken.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always play **Cooperate (C)**. This is the strategic starting point.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** The decision rule remains the same as for any other round. However, the *incentive structure* changes because there are no future rounds to influence. In the absence of future benefits from cooperation, rational players might be tempted to defect. This strategy, by its nature, will continue to follow its established rules, attempting to maintain cooperation until the very end based on the *immediate past* round's outcome.
*   **No previous round data (t=1):** As stated above, always play **C**.
*   **No cooperators in the previous round (all defected):** The strategy dictates **D**. This is a stable outcome for the strategy, but the hope is that other strategies might eventually break this cycle.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Default to Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating, offering the highest possible collective payoff.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** It explicitly rewards group behavior that reaches a significant majority of cooperators (`>= n/2`).
*   **Forgiving Punishment:** The punishment phase (playing D when `< n/2` cooperated) is not a "grim trigger" where one defection leads to permanent defection. Instead, it's a temporary measure to signal dissatisfaction. If cooperation rebounds above the `n/2` threshold in the subsequent round, the strategy reverts to cooperating, offering a path back to mutual benefit. This makes it more resilient to occasional lapses and encourages players to "get back on track."
*   **Focus on Group Outcome:** The decision rule is based on the *total number of cooperators*, indicating a concern for the collective outcome rather than purely individual gain.

**Robustness and Adaptability:**

*   **Against Pure Defectors:** If opponents consistently defect, this strategy will eventually settle into a cycle of cooperation (round 1) followed by defection for the remaining rounds, mirroring the all-defect outcome but with an initial cooperative phase.
*   **Against Grim Triggers:** This strategy is more forgiving than a pure Grim Trigger. It won't permanently defect after a single defection from another player. It allows for recovery if cooperation picks up.
*   **Against Tit-for-Tat:** It's more "generous" by cooperating even if only a minority cooperated previously (as long as it wasn't zero). This can help pull a group out of a cycle of mutual defection.
*   **Against Random Strategies:** If opponents occasionally cooperate randomly, this strategy can capitalize on it, especially if the random cooperation crosses the `n/2` threshold.

This strategy aims to create a positive feedback loop for cooperation while having a clear, but not irreversible, response to group underperformance.

description_COOPERATIVE_84 = '''
This is a fascinating challenge, aiming to design a cooperative strategy in a repeated Public Goods Game where cooperation is not individually rational in any single round. The key lies in leveraging the repeated nature of the game to foster cooperation through conditional reciprocity.

Here's a cooperative strategy designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Conditional Cooperation (ACC)

**Core Principle:** ACC aims to maximize the collective payoff by encouraging cooperation, while swiftly punishing defection and rewarding sustained cooperation. It's built on the idea of "tit-for-tat" but extended to a public goods context, acknowledging the group benefit.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round *t* (where *t* > 1) for player *i* depends on the observed actions of *all* players in round *t-1* and the parameters of the game.

*   **Initial Cooperation (Round 1):** In the very first round, ACC always **Cooperates (C)**. This establishes a baseline of good faith and an attempt to trigger a cooperative equilibrium.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Condition for Cooperation (C):** Player *i* will **Cooperate (C)** in round *t* if, in the previous round (*t-1*), **at least one other player** besides player *i* also cooperated.
    *   **Condition for Defection (D):** Player *i* will **Defect (D)** in round *t* if, in the previous round (*t-1*), **no other player** besides player *i* cooperated. In simpler terms, if all other players defected in the previous round, ACC defects in the current round.

**Rationale for these rules:**

*   **Encouraging Cooperation:** By cooperating when at least one other player cooperates, ACC rewards even partial cooperation and provides an incentive for others to continue cooperating. It avoids punishing a player who might have defected while others were still cooperating.
*   **Punishing Defection:** If everyone else defects, it signals a breakdown of cooperation. ACC defects to avoid being exploited and to send a clear signal that such widespread defection will not be tolerated. This aims to deter future widespread defection.
*   **Adaptability:** The strategy adapts based on the observed collective behavior. If the group can sustain even minimal cooperation, ACC continues to reciprocate. If the group collapses into defection, ACC responds in kind.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** As stated, always **Cooperate (C)**. This is a crucial starting point to try and initiate a cooperative dynamic.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** The rules for subsequent rounds apply directly. There is no special "end-game" strategy designed to exploit others or guarantee a specific outcome in the final round. The strategy is designed to maintain its principles consistently throughout the game. The rationale is that a consistent strategy is more predictable and can better foster long-term patterns, even if there's no future to "punish" in.
*   **Single Player Defection:** If in round *t-1*, player *i* cooperated but all other *n-1* players defected, ACC will **Defect (D)** in round *t*. This is covered by the "no other player cooperated" condition. This is a necessary response to prevent exploitation.
*   **All Players Cooperate:** If in round *t-1*, all players (including player *i*) cooperated, player *i* will **Cooperate (C)** in round *t*. This is the ideal cooperative outcome and ACC reinforces it.
*   **Mixed Cooperation/Defection:** If in round *t-1*, player *i* cooperated and some others cooperated while others defected, player *i* will **Cooperate (C)** in round *t* (as long as at least one *other* player cooperated).

### 3. Cooperativeness:

ACC is fundamentally cooperative in its design:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** It always starts by cooperating, signaling a willingness to work towards the higher collective payoffs achievable through cooperation.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** It reciprocates cooperation whenever it observes it from at least one other player, reinforcing positive behavior.
*   **Punishes Defection, Not Individual Mistakes:** ACC only punishes (defects) when there's a clear signal of widespread defection (i.e., no other player cooperated). It doesn't defect for a single instance of another player defecting, which would be overly sensitive and could lead to a swift breakdown of cooperation.
*   **Maximizes Collective Potential:** By trying to establish and sustain cooperation, ACC aims to reach the mutually beneficial outcome where all players receive a payoff of 2 in every round (when n=6, k=2 for example), which is significantly higher than the payoff of 1 achieved through universal defection.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
Strategy ACC:
  Parameters: n, r, k (available globally)
  History: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a round and contains the actions of all players in that round.
           e.g., History = [(action_p1_r1, action_p2_r1, ..., action_pn_r1), (action_p1_r2, ...), ...]

  Function DecideAction(current_round, player_id, game_history):
    // game_history is a list of lists, where game_history[t-1] is the list of actions in round t-1

    // Round 1: Always cooperate
    if current_round == 1:
      return C

    // Get actions from the previous round
    previous_round_actions = game_history[current_round - 1] // 0-indexed history for t-1

    // Count the number of cooperators in the previous round, excluding this player's potential action
    other_cooperators_count = 0
    for action in previous_round_actions:
      if action == C:
        other_cooperators_count += 1

    // Decision Rule: Cooperate if at least one other player cooperated last round
    if other_cooperators_count > 0:
      return C
    else:
      // If no other player cooperated, defect
      return D

```

**Note on `game_history`:** The `game_history` in the pseudocode would be assumed to be a shared, perfect record of all past actions for all players. The `player_id` is implicit in the strategy's logic as it considers "other players."

This strategy is designed to be robust by not being overly sensitive to single defections, thus giving cooperation a chance to re-establish itself. It's adaptive because its behavior is directly dictated by the observed collective actions of opponents. Its inherent cooperativeness stems from its willingness to initiate and reciprocate cooperation to achieve higher joint payoffs.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_85 = '''
This is an intriguing challenge! Designing a purely cooperative, history-dependent strategy for a repeated Public Goods Game without any explicit communication requires careful consideration of incentives and adaptability. Here's a strategy designed to maximize cooperation while being robust.

## Cooperative Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity (AR)

The core idea behind Adaptive Reciprocity (AR) is to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a strong emphasis on forgiveness and rebuilding trust. It leverages the repeated nature of the game to learn and adapt to the prevailing behavior of the group.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round `t` (where `t > 1`) depends on the observed behavior of the other players in the previous round `t-1`, specifically their cooperation rate.

**Initial Cooperation:**
*   **Round 1:** Always **Cooperate (C)**. This is the foundation of our cooperative stance. By initiating cooperation, we signal our intent to engage in the public good and provide an opportunity for others to reciprocate.

**Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
The decision is based on a threshold derived from the average cooperation rate of *all* players in the previous round.

*   **Calculate Average Cooperation Rate:** In round `t-1`, let `N_C(t-1)` be the number of players who cooperated, and `N_D(t-1)` be the number of players who defected. The average cooperation rate is `AvgCoop(t-1) = N_C(t-1) / n`.

*   **Decision Threshold:** We will define a "cooperation threshold" that influences our decision. This threshold is dynamic and adapts based on past experiences.
    *   Let `CoopThreshold(t)` be the threshold for round `t`.

*   **Decision Logic:**
    *   **If `AvgCoop(t-1) >= CoopThreshold(t)`:** Then **Cooperate (C)**. If the overall level of cooperation in the previous round was sufficiently high, it indicates a general willingness to contribute, and we continue to support it.
    *   **If `AvgCoop(t-1) < CoopThreshold(t)`:** Then **Defect (D)**. If the overall level of cooperation fell below our threshold, it suggests that sustained cooperation is not being reciprocated, and defecting is individually rational given the observed behavior.

**Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
The `CoopThreshold(t)` is not static. It needs to adapt to changing group dynamics.

*   **Initial Threshold (for round 2):** Set `CoopThreshold(2) = 0.5`. This means if at least half the players cooperated in round 1, we continue to cooperate.

*   **Threshold Update Rule (for round t > 2):**
    *   **If we cooperated in round `t-1` AND `AvgCoop(t-1) >= CoopThreshold(t-1)`:** This is a "successful" round of cooperation. We are optimistic and can afford to be slightly more lenient. `CoopThreshold(t) = max(0.1, CoopThreshold(t-1) - 0.05)`. We slightly lower the threshold to encourage cooperation even if it dips a little. The `max(0.1, ...)` prevents the threshold from becoming too low, effectively always cooperating.
    *   **If we defected in round `t-1` AND `AvgCoop(t-1) < CoopThreshold(t-1)`:** This indicates a need for a stricter stance. `CoopThreshold(t) = min(0.9, CoopThreshold(t-1) + 0.1)`. We slightly increase the threshold, requiring a higher level of cooperation before we rejoin. The `min(0.9, ...)` prevents the threshold from becoming impossibly high.
    *   **In all other cases (e.g., we cooperated but others defected, or we defected but others cooperated):** The situation is mixed. We maintain the current threshold: `CoopThreshold(t) = CoopThreshold(t-1)`. This signifies cautious observation.

**Rationale for Dynamic Threshold:**
*   **Forgiveness:** By slowly lowering the threshold after successful cooperation, we are forgiving minor dips in overall cooperation and encouraging continued collective effort.
*   **Punishment:** By raising the threshold after sustained defection, we signal that free-riding has consequences, but we don't immediately abandon cooperation entirely.
*   **Adaptability:** The threshold learns from past rounds, adjusting to the "norms" that emerge within the group without explicit pre-programming.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always **Cooperate (C)**. This is a critical initial signal of cooperative intent.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** This is the most challenging edge case in repeated games. In a finite game with no future repercussions, the rational strategy is to defect in the last round, regardless of past behavior. However, to maintain the spirit of the "cooperative strategy" and its *potential* for influencing others, our strategy will *still* follow the decision rules based on round `r-1`'s behavior and the current `CoopThreshold(r)`.

    *   **Why not defect automatically in the last round?**
        *   **Consistency:** The strategy's core is history-dependent reciprocity. Abandoning it in the last round would be inconsistent.
        *   **Potential for Influence:** While there's no future for *this* specific game, a consistent cooperative strategy *might* still influence the behavior of other players in the final round, leading to a slightly better collective outcome, even if it's only for that one round.
        *   **Robustness:** The strategy is designed to be robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors. Automatically defecting in the last round would be a specific assumption about opponents' rationality that we're trying to avoid solely dictating our strategy.

*   **No other players observed (e.g., if n=2 and the other player always plays D):** The `AvgCoop` calculation naturally handles this. If the other player defects, `AvgCoop` will reflect that, and our strategy will adjust accordingly.

*   **Initial stages of the game (e.g., rounds 2-3):** The threshold will be most volatile here as it tries to establish a baseline. The strategy might oscillate between C and D as it learns the group's tendencies. This is acceptable and part of the adaptive process.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The strategy is inherently cooperative in its design principles:

*   **Initiation:** It always starts with cooperation, giving the benefit of the doubt.
*   **Reciprocity:** It aims to match cooperative behavior with further cooperation.
*   **Forgiveness:** It does not permanently punish defection. The threshold adjustment is gradual, allowing for a return to cooperation if the group's behavior improves.
*   **Collective Benefit Focus:** The decision to defect is not purely self-interested in the short term but is a response to perceived threats to the *collective's* ability to achieve higher payoffs through cooperation. By defecting when cooperation falters, we aim to steer the group back towards a state where mutual cooperation is more likely and beneficial.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
// Parameters: n, r, k

// State Variables (internal to the strategy)
current_round = 1
coop_threshold = 0.5 // Initial threshold for round 2
player_actions_history = [] // List of lists, where each inner list contains actions of all players in a round

function decide_action():
    if current_round == 1:
        action = C
    else:
        // Get actions from the previous round
        previous_round_actions = player_actions_history[current_round - 2] // Indexing starts from 0

        // Calculate number of cooperators and defectors in the previous round
        num_cooperators = count_of_C(previous_round_actions)
        num_defectors = n - num_cooperators
        avg_coop_rate = num_cooperators / n

        // Decide action based on threshold
        if avg_coop_rate >= coop_threshold:
            action = C
        else:
            action = D

        // Update coop_threshold for the *next* round (t+1)
        if action == C and avg_coop_rate >= coop_threshold: // Successful cooperation
            coop_threshold = max(0.1, coop_threshold - 0.05)
        elif action == D and avg_coop_rate < coop_threshold: // Defection justified by low cooperation
            coop_threshold = min(0.9, coop_threshold + 0.1)
        // Else: Threshold remains the same

    // Record our action for this round (needed for history)
    // This would typically be done after the round concludes and actions are revealed.
    // For decision making *in* the round, we don't have our own action yet.
    // The strategy needs to store its *own* decision for the current round *after* the round is played to update history.

    current_round = current_round + 1
    return action

// Function to be called at the end of each round to record outcomes:
function update_history(round_actions): // round_actions is a list of actions of all players
    player_actions_history.append(round_actions)
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode and State:**

*   `current_round`: Tracks the current round number.
*   `coop_threshold`: Stores the dynamic threshold. Initialized to 0.5 for round 2.
*   `player_actions_history`: This is crucial. It will store the history of actions of *all* players for each completed round. When `decide_action` is called for round `t`, it looks at `player_actions_history[t-2]` to get the actions from round `t-1`.
*   `decide_action()`: The main logic.
    *   Handles round 1 separately.
    *   For subsequent rounds, it retrieves the previous round's actions, calculates the average cooperation rate, and makes a decision based on the `coop_threshold`.
    *   Crucially, it then *updates* the `coop_threshold` for the *next* round based on the outcome of the current decision and the observed group behavior.
*   `update_history(round_actions)`: This function would be called *after* all players have revealed their actions for a round. It appends the complete list of actions for that round to `player_actions_history`.

This Adaptive Reciprocity strategy aims to be a strong contender by being forgiving enough to foster cooperation but stern enough to punish free-riding when necessary, all while dynamically adapting to the environment it finds itself in.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_86 = '''
This is a classic N-player Public Goods Game, a fascinating arena for strategic interaction where individual incentives to defect can undermine collective well-being. The core challenge is to find a way to foster cooperation in a setting with a dominant incentive to defect in the short term, while acknowledging the potential for long-term gains from mutual cooperation.

Here's a strategy designed to be cooperative, adaptive, and robust, relying solely on game parameters and history:

## Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Conditional Cooperation

This strategy can be summarized as: **Start by cooperating, and then try to match the average behavior of others, with a strong tendency to punish defection by defecting in the next round. However, give a chance for a return to cooperation if the collective good appears to be improving.**

This strategy aims to:
*   **Be cooperative initially:** To signal a willingness to cooperate and test the waters.
*   **Punish defection:** To deter free-riding and maintain fairness.
*   **Allow for forgiveness and return to cooperation:** To avoid getting stuck in a cycle of mutual defection.
*   **Be adaptive:** To respond to changing group dynamics.

### 1. Decision Rules:

Our strategy will dictate player $i$'s action in round $t$, denoted as $a_{i,t} \in \{C, D\}$.

**Core Logic:**

*   **If everyone cooperated in the previous round ($t-1$), then cooperate in round $t$.** This is the ideal state, and we want to reinforce it.
*   **If at least one player defected in the previous round ($t-1$):**
    *   **Calculate the average cooperation rate in the previous round ($t-1$).** Let this be $\bar{c}_{t-1} = (\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{j, t-1}) / n$.
    *   **If the average cooperation rate in the previous round ($\bar{c}_{t-1}$) was sufficiently high, then cooperate in round $t$.** "Sufficiently high" is a threshold that balances forgiveness with the need to punish. We define a threshold $\tau$.
    *   **Otherwise (if the average cooperation rate was not sufficiently high), then defect in round $t$.** This is the punishment phase for persistent or widespread defection.

**Defining the Threshold ($\tau$):**

The threshold $\tau$ is crucial. It represents the minimum level of collective cooperation we are willing to accept to give others another chance. A good starting point for $\tau$ would be a value slightly above the minimal sustainable cooperation level. Considering the payoff function, if $k/n < 1$ (which is given in the problem statement $1 < k < n$, so $k/n$ can be less than 1), then individual defection is always profitable. However, mutual cooperation yields a payoff of $k$, which is greater than the payoff from mutual defection (1).

To incentivize cooperation, we need to ensure that the payoff from cooperating when others cooperate is sufficiently attractive. Let's consider the average payoff.

If we have $m$ cooperators, the total payoff is $m \times 0 + (n-m) \times 1 + (k/n) \times m \times n = n-m + km$.
The average payoff per player is $(n-m + km) / n = 1 - m/n + k$.
If $m=n$ (all cooperate), average payoff is $1 - 1 + k = k$.
If $m=0$ (all defect), average payoff is $1 - 0 + k = 1$.

The condition $k > 1$ means that collective cooperation is better than collective defection.
The condition $k < n$ means that $(k/n) < 1$. This implies that an individual player receives less than their contribution back from the public good if they cooperate, even if everyone else cooperates. Specifically, if everyone else cooperates ($n-1$ cooperators) and player $i$ cooperates, their payoff is $0 + (k/n) \times n = k$. If player $i$ defects instead, their payoff is $1 + (k/n) \times (n-1)$. For defection to be strictly more profitable, $1 + (k/n)(n-1) > k \implies 1 + k - k/n > k \implies 1 > k/n$. This is guaranteed by $k < n$. This confirms the individual incentive to defect.

Therefore, we need a threshold that is high enough to signal that we are not easily deterred by a few defections, but low enough to allow for recovery. A reasonable starting point for $\tau$ could be slightly above the point where the average payoff for cooperating becomes less than defecting.

Let's analyze the payoff for player $i$ if they cooperate when $m$ players (including themselves) cooperate:
$\pi_{i,C} = 0 + (k/n) \times m$
If they defect in this scenario:
$\pi_{i,D} = 1 + (k/n) \times (m-1)$

Player $i$ prefers to cooperate if $\pi_{i,C} > \pi_{i,D}$:
$(k/n) \times m > 1 + (k/n) \times (m-1)$
$km/n > 1 + km/n - k/n$
$0 > 1 - k/n$
$k/n > 1$
This is not possible given $k<n$. So an individual player *always* prefers to defect if they can get away with it, assuming the total number of cooperators is fixed.

Now consider the average cooperation rate. If $\bar{c}_{t-1}$ is the average cooperation rate in the previous round, our decision to cooperate in round $t$ depends on $\bar{c}_{t-1} \ge \tau$.

What is a sensible $\tau$? We want to incentivize cooperation. If the average cooperation rate falls below a certain point, it means the collective is not benefiting enough from cooperation, and it's individually rational to defect. A good heuristic might be related to the minimal conditions for mutual cooperation to be better than mutual defection for an individual.

Let's consider the minimum number of cooperators ($m$) required for a cooperator to receive a higher payoff than a defector, assuming this player is one of the $m$ cooperators.
If player $i$ cooperates and total cooperators are $m$: $\pi_{i,C} = (k/n) \times m$.
If player $i$ defects and total cooperators are $m-1$: $\pi_{i,D} = 1 + (k/n) \times (m-1)$.
Player $i$ prefers to cooperate if $(k/n) \times m > 1 + (k/n) \times (m-1)$.
This simplifies to $k/n > 1$, which we know is not true. This means an individual will always prefer to defect if they can ensure the number of cooperators stays the same or decreases.

However, the game is about collective outcomes. Mutual cooperation yields $k$ for everyone, mutual defection yields 1. If $k>1$, mutual cooperation is better. The strategy needs to encourage this.

Let's define $\tau$ based on the fact that if the *average* cooperation rate is high enough, the *average* payoff from cooperation is good.
Average payoff per player when $\bar{c}$ is the cooperation rate: $1 - \bar{c} + k \times \bar{c}$.
If player $i$ cooperates: $\pi_i = (k/n) \times (\text{total cooperators})$.
If player $i$ defects: $\pi_i = 1 + (k/n) \times (\text{total cooperators} - 1)$.

Consider the scenario where $m$ players cooperate and $n-m$ players defect.
A cooperator gets $(k/n) \times m$.
A defector gets $1 + (k/n) \times m$.
So, defectors always get more *in that round* if the number of cooperators is fixed.

The goal of our strategy is to sustain a high number of cooperators in the long run. We need to make defecting costly. The "punishment" mechanism is key.

**Proposed Threshold $\tau$:**

Let's set $\tau$ based on ensuring that if the group *nearly* cooperates, we give them a chance to fully cooperate. A reasonable $\tau$ could be related to the highest payoff a defector can get while still allowing for mutual cooperation to be beneficial.

A simple and robust threshold: $\tau = 1/2$. This means we'll only defect if less than half the players cooperated in the previous round. This is a middle ground, forgiving of moderate defection but punishing of widespread free-riding.

**Formalizing Decision Rules:**

Let $a_{i,t-1}$ be player $i$'s action in round $t-1$ ($1$ for C, $0$ for D).
Let $N_C(t-1) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j,t-1}$ be the number of cooperators in round $t-1$.
Let $\bar{c}_{t-1} = N_C(t-1) / n$ be the average cooperation rate in round $t-1$.

For round $t$, player $i$'s action $a_{i,t}$ is determined as follows:

*   **If $t=1$ (First Round):** Cooperate ($a_{i,1} = C$).
*   **If $t > 1$:**
    *   **If $N_C(t-1) = n$ (all cooperated in previous round):** Cooperate ($a_{i,t} = C$).
    *   **Else (at least one defection in previous round):**
        *   **If $\bar{c}_{t-1} \ge \tau$ (where $\tau = 1/2$):** Cooperate ($a_{i,t} = C$).
        *   **Else ($\bar{c}_{t-1} < \tau$):** Defect ($a_{i,t} = D$).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round ($t=1$):** As stated above, we begin by cooperating ($a_{i,1} = C$). This is a standard approach in repeated games to signal a willingness to engage in cooperative behavior and to probe the environment. It's a low-cost way to initiate cooperation and see how others respond.

*   **Last Round ($t=r$):** In the context of this problem, the game is repeated for a fixed number of rounds, $r > 1$. The standard economic theory of repeated games with a finite horizon suggests that the only subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is for all players to defect in every round. This is because the logic of backward induction applies: in the last round, there's no future to consider, so individual defection is the dominant strategy.

    However, the prompt asks for a *cooperative* strategy. If we strictly adhere to the backward induction logic, a cooperative strategy is impossible in a finite repeated game. The spirit of this challenge is likely to explore strategies that *attempt* cooperation despite the finite horizon, or to assume a slight deviation from perfect rationality where players might still cooperate in the last round if the history has been cooperative.

    Given the constraint of designing a cooperative strategy, and the fact that the prompt emphasizes "adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors" and "clearly align with the cooperative mindset," a pure backward-induction defection in the last round would contradict this.

    **Therefore, for the last round ($t=r$), our strategy will follow the same logic as any other round:**
    *   If all cooperated in round $r-1$, cooperate in round $r$.
    *   If some defected in round $r-1$, check the average cooperation rate $\bar{c}_{r-1}$. If $\bar{c}_{r-1} \ge \tau$, cooperate in round $r$. Otherwise, defect in round $r$.

    This approach acknowledges the inherent pressure to defect in the final round but prioritizes maintaining the established cooperative norm if it has been successful. It's a form of "conditional cooperation" that extends to the very end. This is more "cooperative" than immediate defection, and it remains adaptive to the group's behavior.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts with an act of cooperation, signaling a positive intent and a desire for collective gain.
*   **Forgiveness and Re-engagement:** The inclusion of the threshold $\tau$ means that the strategy doesn't immediately retaliate with permanent defection upon the first sign of trouble. It allows for a period of observation and gives the group a chance to self-correct. If the average cooperation rate remains above $\tau$, the strategy will continue to cooperate, facilitating a return to mutual cooperation.
*   **Reinforcing Positive Behavior:** The condition "If $N_C(t-1) = n$, then cooperate" actively rewards and reinforces full group cooperation, strengthening the cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Fairness:** By punishing widespread defection (when $\bar{c}_{t-1} < \tau$), the strategy attempts to prevent free-riding and ensure that those who contribute are not disproportionately exploited. This maintains a sense of fairness, which is essential for long-term cooperation.

This strategy is designed to be a robust and cooperative player in the N-player Public Goods Game tournament, balancing the desire for collective gain with the need to adapt to the actions of others. Its strength lies in its initial cooperative stance, its conditional punishment, and its ability to forgive and re-engage in cooperation.

description_COOPERATIVE_87 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with a Punishment Threshold

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a forgiving element to avoid perpetual conflict. It's built around observing the collective behavior of the group and adjusting its own actions accordingly.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of this strategy revolves around monitoring the **proportion of cooperators** in the previous round and a **punishment threshold**.

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   It's the first round.
    *   The proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round was **greater than or equal to the punishment threshold**.
    *   The proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round was **less than the punishment threshold, but the current round is not the last round**, AND the proportion of cooperators has been **increasing** (even slightly) or remained the same for the last few rounds. This allows for a gradual recovery from defection.

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   The proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round was **strictly less than the punishment threshold**, AND the proportion of cooperators has been **decreasing** for the last few rounds.
    *   It's the **last round**, and the proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round was **less than the punishment threshold**.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Always Cooperate (C).** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative stance is to initiate cooperation. This signals a willingness to contribute to the public good and encourages others to do the same.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   The decision rule for the last round is crucial. If cooperation has been successful leading up to the last round (proportion of cooperators >= punishment threshold), then **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   However, if defection has been prevalent (proportion of cooperators < punishment threshold) in the preceding rounds, the strategy will **Defect (D)** in the last round. This is a grim trigger – realizing that further rounds of cooperation are impossible, the strategy ensures it maximizes its private payoff by keeping its endowment. This is a necessary evil to prevent exploitation when cooperation has broken down.

*   **Punishment Threshold:**
    *   The punishment threshold should be a **value slightly above the payoff of defecting when everyone else cooperates**.
    *   Let's analyze the payoff for a defector when everyone else cooperates: Player `i` defects, and `n-1` players cooperate. Player `i`'s payoff is `(1 - 0) + (k/n) * (n-1) = 1 + k*(n-1)/n`.
    *   Let's analyze the payoff for a cooperator when everyone else cooperates: Player `i` cooperates, and `n-1` players defect. Player `i`'s payoff is `(1 - 1) + (k/n) * (n-1) = k*(n-1)/n`.
    *   The payoff for defecting when `x` players cooperate is `1 + (k/n)*x`.
    *   The payoff for cooperating when `x` players cooperate is `(k/n)*x`.
    *   The incentive to defect exists when `1 + (k/n)*x > (k/n)*x`, which is always true as `1 > 0`.
    *   However, the strategy needs to incentivize cooperation. A good punishment threshold would be slightly *above* the payoff one gets from defecting when a substantial number are cooperating, ensuring that it's beneficial to maintain a decent level of cooperation.
    *   A robust punishment threshold could be set as **`k/n`**. If the proportion of cooperators falls below `k/n`, it means that the individual benefit of cooperation (`(k/n)*c_j`) is less than the individual cost of contribution (`1-c_i`).

*   **Monitoring Trend:** To be more robust against single-round fluctuations, the strategy will look at the trend of cooperation over the last 2-3 rounds (if history is available). If the proportion of cooperators has been consistently decreasing, it's a stronger signal to defect. If it's increasing or stable, it suggests recovery or continued success.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative because:

*   **It initiates cooperation:** The first round decision is always to cooperate, setting a positive example.
*   **It rewards cooperation:** When a sufficient level of cooperation is maintained (proportion of cooperators >= punishment threshold), the strategy continues to cooperate.
*   **It attempts to recover from defection:** Even if the punishment threshold is breached, if there's a sign of recovery (increasing or stable cooperation), it gives cooperation another chance. This is a forgiving element that aims to bring the group back to a cooperative state.
*   **It only defects as a last resort:** Defection is only triggered when cooperation has significantly broken down and is unlikely to recover, especially in the final round. This minimizes unnecessary defections and maximizes the potential for mutual benefit in the long run.

description_COOPERATIVE_88 = '''
This is a fascinating challenge, designing a purely cooperative yet adaptive strategy for a repeated Public Goods Game. Given the constraints of no communication and the need to be robust, my strategy will focus on **conditional cooperation with a punitive element and a recovery mechanism.** The core idea is to reward cooperation and punish defection, but with a degree of forgiveness to encourage a return to cooperation.

Here's the strategy design:

## Strategy Name: Forgiving Tit-for-Tat (FTFT)

This strategy is inspired by Tit-for-Tat in Prisoner's Dilemma, but adapted for a public goods setting where individual defection is not as immediately detrimental as in a pairwise game, and the benefit of collective action is more diffuse.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round *t* is based on the observed behavior of the *other* players in the previous round(s).

*   **Initial State (Round 1):** Always Cooperate. This is to signal a willingness to engage in cooperation and to establish a baseline of positive behavior.
*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **If the *average* cooperation rate of all other players in round *t-1* was above a certain threshold, Cooperate.** This rewards sustained cooperation from the group.
    *   **If the *average* cooperation rate of all other players in round *t-1* was below a certain threshold, Defect.** This punishes defection and discourages free-riding.
    *   **If the *average* cooperation rate of all other players in round *t-1* was exactly at the threshold, maintain the previous round's action.** This prevents erratic behavior when the group is at the brink.

**Defining the Threshold:** The threshold for average cooperation will be dynamic. It will be set to the **average cooperation rate of all other players in the previous round, adjusted slightly downwards.** This is the "forgiving" aspect. If the group *was* cooperating, we'll expect them to continue at roughly the same level. If they drop slightly, we'll still give them a chance before defecting.

**Formalizing the Threshold:**
Let $AvgCoop_{t-1}$ be the average cooperation rate of all other players (excluding player *i*) in round *t-1*.
Let $n'$ be the number of other players ($n' = n-1$).
Let $C_{j, t-1}$ be 1 if player *j* cooperated in round *t-1*, and 0 if player *j* defected.
$AvgCoop_{t-1} = \frac{\sum_{j \neq i} C_{j, t-1}}{n'}$

Our decision rule for player *i* in round *t* will be:

*   **Round 1:** Play C.
*   **Round t > 1:**
    *   **Calculate Target Cooperation Rate for Round t:** $TargetCoop_t = max(0, AvgCoop_{t-1} - \delta)$
        *   Where $\delta$ is a small positive value (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2). This $\delta$ represents the "forgiveness factor".
    *   **If $AvgCoop_{t-1} \ge TargetCoop_t$ (or if it's the first round where this condition is met after a period of defection):** Play C.
    *   **If $AvgCoop_{t-1} < TargetCoop_t$:** Play D.

**Refinement: Tracking Consecutive Defections:** To prevent excessive punishment when the group is just dipping, we will introduce a counter for consecutive rounds where the *average* cooperation rate of others falls below the threshold.

*   If the average cooperation rate of others falls below the threshold for **more than `M` consecutive rounds**, we will switch to a more aggressive punishment strategy for a few rounds (e.g., defect for `M` rounds regardless of their behavior, then revert to FTFT). `M` can be a small parameter (e.g., 2 or 3).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always Cooperate. This is the standard optimistic start.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the very last round, the incentive to cooperate disappears completely, as there are no future rounds to be punished or rewarded. Therefore, in the last round, the optimal strategy is to always **Defect**, regardless of past history. This is because the payoff from defecting (1) is always higher than the payoff from cooperating (1 + (k/n) * total_contributions, which is at most 1 + k/n).
*   **Early Rounds of Defection:** If the group starts defecting, FTFT will gradually reduce its cooperation rate. The forgiveness factor $\delta$ ensures that a temporary dip in cooperation doesn't immediately lead to a permanent defection cycle.
*   **Sustained Defection:** If the majority of players consistently defect, FTFT will also consistently defect after a few rounds of seeing this pattern. The consecutive defection counter (`M`) will eventually trigger a more aggressive response if the group shows no signs of returning to cooperation.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its intent and initial action. It aims to foster a cooperative environment by:

*   **Starting with Cooperation:** Demonstrating a willingness to invest in the public good.
*   **Rewarding Cooperation:** Continuing to cooperate when others do, reinforcing the benefits of collective action.
*   **Conditional Punishment:** Defecting only when the group consistently defects, signaling that free-riding is not tolerated. This is a deterrent rather than pure spite.
*   **Forgiveness:** The $\delta$ factor allows for the recovery of cooperation even after periods of defection, preventing the game from collapsing into universal defection too easily.
*   **Adaptive:** The strategy learns from the group's behavior and adjusts its own actions accordingly.

        return "C"

    // Calculate average cooperation rate of other players in round t-1
    total_other_cooperators = 0
    for each other_player_j in opponent_actions_history[t-2]: // t-2 because history is 0-indexed for rounds
        if other_player_j == "C":
            total_other_cooperators += 1
    
    num_other_players = n - 1
    avg_other_cooperation = total_other_cooperators / num_other_players

    if avg_other_cooperation < target_cooperation:
        consecutive_opponent_defections += 1
    else:
        consecutive_opponent_defections = 0

    // Decide action based on observed behavior
    if consecutive_opponent_defections > M:
        // Aggressive punishment phase (optional, can be more complex)
        // For simplicity, just defect for M rounds and then return to FTFT logic
        current_strategy = "D" 
    else if avg_other_cooperation >= target_cooperation:
        current_strategy = "C"
    else: // avg_other_cooperation < target_cooperation
        current_strategy = "D"

    my_actions[t-1] = current_strategy // Store my action
    return current_strategy

// --- Function to update history after each round ---
function update_history(round_t_actions): // round_t_actions is a list of all players' actions in round t
    my_action = round_t_actions[i] // Assuming i is player i's index
    
    // Store opponent actions for round t
    opponent_actions_this_round = []
    for player_index, action in enumerate(round_t_actions):

    opponent_actions_history.append(opponent_actions_this_round) // Append to history for next round's decision
```

This strategy aims for a balance between enforcing cooperation and allowing for the re-establishment of it. It's designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, from consistent cooperators to consistent defectors, and even those who fluctuate. The key is the adaptive threshold and the element of forgiveness.

This strategy aims to foster cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, while being resilient to various opponent behaviors. It's designed to be adaptive and learn from the game's history.

## Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness"

This strategy combines elements of Tit-for-Tat (reciprocity) with a mechanism for re-establishing cooperation after a period of defection (forgiveness). The core idea is to start cooperatively, mirror the opponent's previous move, but allow for a chance to return to cooperation if the group consistently returns to it.

### 1. Decision Rules

**For player i in round t (where t > 1):**

*   **If the average contribution in the previous round (t-1) was high enough:** Play C.
    *   "High enough" is defined by a threshold. If more than a certain proportion of players cooperated in the previous round, we consider the group to be generally cooperative.
*   **If the average contribution in the previous round (t-1) was not high enough:** Play D.
    *   This is the reactive component: if the group is not cooperating, neither will I.

**For player i in round t (where t=1, the first round):**

*   **Always play C.**
    *   This establishes a cooperative starting point and signals a desire for cooperation.

**The "Forgiveness" Mechanism (integrated into the "high enough" condition):**

The strategy doesn't solely rely on the immediate previous round. It incorporates a short memory of consistent defection.

*   **Condition for "average contribution in the previous round was high enough":**
    *   Let $N_C(t-1)$ be the number of cooperators in round $t-1$.
    *   Let $P_C(t-1) = N_C(t-1) / n$ be the proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$.
    *   **Rule:** Cooperate if $P_C(t-1) \ge \theta$.

*   **Adaptive Threshold ($\theta$):** The threshold $\theta$ itself is not fixed. It adapts based on the observed behavior.
    *   Start with a moderate initial threshold, e.g., $\theta = 0.6$ (60% cooperation).
    *   **If the group consistently fails to meet the threshold for a few consecutive rounds:** The strategy becomes more lenient, slightly lowering $\theta$ to encourage a return to cooperation.
    *   **If the group consistently meets or exceeds the threshold:** The strategy becomes slightly more demanding, slightly raising $\theta$.

**Refined Decision Rule:**

For player i in round t (where t > 1):

1.  Calculate the proportion of cooperators in the previous round, $P_C(t-1)$.
2.  Compare $P_C(t-1)$ with the current adaptive threshold $\theta$.
3.  **If $P_C(t-1) \ge \theta$:** Play C.
4.  **If $P_C(t-1) < \theta$:** Play D.

**Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **Initial Threshold:** $\theta_{initial} = 0.6$
*   **Minimum Threshold:** $\theta_{min} = 0.4$
*   **Maximum Threshold:** $\theta_{max} = 0.9$
*   **Adjustment Step:** $\Delta\theta = 0.05$
*   **Consecutive Failure/Success Count:** `consecutive_failures` and `consecutive_successes`

**Threshold Update Logic (after each round t-1 to set $\theta$ for round t):**

*   If $P_C(t-1) \ge \theta$:
    *   `consecutive_successes` increases by 1.
    *   `consecutive_failures` resets to 0.
    *   If `consecutive_successes` reaches a certain level (e.g., 3), and $\theta < \theta_{max}$: $\theta = \min(\theta + \Delta\theta, \theta_{max})$.
*   If $P_C(t-1) < \theta$:
    *   `consecutive_failures` increases by 1.
    *   `consecutive_successes` resets to 0.
    *   If `consecutive_failures` reaches a certain level (e.g., 3), and $\theta > \theta_{min}$: $\theta = \max(\theta - \Delta\theta, \theta_{min})$.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** As stated, **always Cooperate (C)**. This is a vital starting point. It signals a commitment to cooperation and allows other players to observe this behavior.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In a finitely repeated game, the last round often resembles a one-shot game, where the incentive is to defect. Our strategy, however, is designed to be robust over multiple rounds.
    *   **For the last round, the strategy follows the same rule as any other round t > 1:** It will cooperate if the average contribution in round $r-1$ met the threshold, and defect otherwise.
    *   This means that if cooperation was sustained throughout the game, the strategy *might* still cooperate in the last round. However, if defections were prevalent in round $r-1$, it will defect in round $r$. The adaptive threshold adjustment is still active up to the final round. This approach is more robust against sophisticated opponents who might try to exploit the "last round defection" logic.

*   **Initializing the Threshold:** The `consecutive_failures` and `consecutive_successes` counters are initialized to 0 at the start of the tournament. The adaptive threshold $\theta$ starts at $\theta_{initial}$.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The strategy is inherently cooperative:

*   **Starts with Cooperation:** The first move is always to cooperate, setting a positive tone.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation by continuing to cooperate when others do. This creates a positive feedback loop for cooperative behavior.
*   **Punishes Defection (Temporarily):** When others defect, the strategy defects in response. This prevents exploitation and signals that defection has consequences.
*   **Forgiveness/Re-engagement:** The adaptive threshold and the consecutive count mechanism allow the strategy to "forgive" a period of widespread defection. If the group shows signs of returning to cooperation, the strategy actively tries to re-establish it by lowering the bar slightly. This is crucial for recovering from temporary breakdowns in cooperation, which are inevitable in a complex, multi-agent environment.
*   **Adaptive Nature:** The strategy doesn't get stuck in a pattern. It learns from the observed outcomes and adjusts its expectations (the threshold) accordingly. This makes it robust to different groups of opponents, from highly cooperative to highly opportunistic.

This N-Player Public Goods Game presents a fascinating challenge for cooperative strategy design, especially in a repeated setting where learning and adaptation are possible. The core tension lies between the individual incentive to defect (keeping the endowment) and the collective benefit of cooperation (multiplying the contributions).

Here's a cooperative strategy designed to be adaptive and robust, focusing on fostering cooperation while safeguarding against exploitation:

## Cooperative Strategy: The "Tit-for-Tat Plus" Strategy

This strategy aims to maximize the long-term collective payoff by encouraging cooperation while retaliating against defections. It builds upon the core idea of reciprocity but incorporates more nuanced responses to ensure sustainability.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision for player `i` in round `t` is based on the observed behavior of all other players in the previous round `t-1`.

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round (`t = 1`), player `i` will **Cooperate (C)**. This sets a cooperative tone and provides an opportunity for mutual benefit from the outset.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **If all other players cooperated in the previous round:** Player `i` will **Cooperate (C)**. This reinforces positive behavior and aims to maintain a high level of collective contribution.
    *   **If at least one other player defected in the previous round:** Player `i` will **Defect (D)**. This is a retaliatory move to punish defections and signal that free-riding is not tolerated. The logic here is that if the collective benefit is not being achieved due to some players' self-interest, it's better to secure one's own endowment in that round.

*   **Exception - The "Forgiving Reciprocity" Mechanism:** After a period of collective defection (where the number of defectors was high), if the number of cooperators *increases* significantly, player `i` will consider returning to cooperation.
    *   **Condition:** If in round `t-1`, player `i` defected, and in round `t-1` there were `D_t-1` defectors and `C_t-1` cooperators, and in round `t` there are `D_t` defectors and `C_t` cooperators, and `C_t > C_{t-1} + threshold_cooperators` (where `threshold_cooperators` is a small positive integer, e.g., 1 or 2), player `i` will **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This mechanism prevents the strategy from getting stuck in perpetual mutual defection if a significant shift towards cooperation is observed. It allows for a re-establishment of trust and cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):** As stated above, always **Cooperate (C)**. This is crucial for initiating the game with a cooperative intent.

*   **Last Round (t = r):** In the final round, the future incentive for cooperation (fear of future retaliation) disappears. This is a classic "end-game problem" in game theory. Given the parameters (`1 < k < n`), defecting in the last round is a dominant strategy for any rational player if they only consider their payoff in that single round.
    *   **Decision:** In the last round (`t = r`), player `i` will **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** While seemingly counter-cooperative, this is a strategic concession to the rational incentive in the final round. Attempting to cooperate when everyone else is expected to defect will likely lead to a lower payoff for player `i` compared to defecting. This decision does not undermine the cooperative intent of the strategy in earlier rounds.

*   **Observing Zero Cooperators:** If in a given round, player `i` observes that *no one* cooperated (all players played D, including potentially player `i` themselves in the previous round), and the "Forgiving Reciprocity" mechanism is not triggered, player `i` will continue to **Defect (D)**. This is because there is no evidence of cooperative intent from the group.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The strategy is inherently cooperative due to its foundational principles:

*   **Pro-Cooperation Stance:** The default action in the absence of negative signals is cooperation. This aims to maximize the collective payoff, which benefits all players when cooperation is sustained.
*   **Reciprocal Behavior:** The strategy mirrors the behavior of others. If others cooperate, it cooperates. If others defect, it defects. This creates a strong incentive for others to cooperate to receive cooperation in return.
*   **Adaptive Nature:** The "Forgiving Reciprocity" mechanism allows the strategy to recover from periods of low cooperation and re-establish cooperative norms if the group shows a genuine shift towards collective benefit. This makes it robust to occasional lapses and encourages long-term cooperative outcomes.
*   **Focus on Long-Term Gain:** By punishing defections, the strategy discourages free-riding and aims to create an environment where cooperation is sustainable and mutually beneficial over the `r` rounds, rather than optimizing for a single round's payoff.

**Note on Pseudocode Implementation:** The "Forgiving Reciprocity" mechanism requires careful implementation to track the number of cooperators over multiple previous rounds. The pseudocode above outlines the logic; a full implementation would involve a more robust history tracking mechanism. The `threshold_cooperators` value could also be a parameter to tune.

This strategy balances the desire for collective gain with the practical necessity of protecting oneself from exploitation. Its adaptive nature makes it resilient to a variety of opponent behaviors, aiming to foster a cooperative equilibrium in the repeated N-player public goods game.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_91 = '''
This is an excellent setup for a Public Goods Game, and designing a robust cooperative strategy for a repeated setting is a classic challenge in game theory and AI. The core tension is the conflict between individual rationality (defecting to keep your endowment) and collective benefit (cooperating to increase the total payoff for everyone).

Here's a cooperative strategy designed to be adaptive and robust, focusing on maximizing long-term collective welfare while also protecting against exploitation.

## Cooperative Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Gradual Escalation

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection. It's adaptive because it learns from past behavior and gradually escalates its response to sustained defection, while remaining cooperative when others are.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of this strategy is **conditional cooperation**, often referred to as "Tit-for-Tat" in simpler games. However, we'll build upon this with adaptive elements to handle the nuances of a Public Goods Game.

*   **Default: Cooperate (C)**. The strategy starts by cooperating and aims to remain cooperative as long as it's beneficial for the collective.
*   **React to Defection:** If **any** player (including yourself, though this is implicitly handled by the payoff calculation) defects in a round, the strategy will consider defecting in the *next* round.
*   **Punishment Threshold:** To avoid being overly sensitive to isolated defections or mistakes, the strategy won't immediately defect after a single defection by others. Instead, it will track the *proportion* of players who defected in the previous round.
    *   Let `D_t` be the number of players who defected in round `t`.
    *   Let `P_D_t = D_t / n` be the proportion of defectors in round `t`.
*   **Decision Logic for Round `t+1`:**
    *   **If `P_D_t` is below a certain *cooperation threshold* (e.g., `c_thresh = 0.25`)**: Cooperate (C) in round `t+1`. This implies that the overall level of defection is low, and it's still beneficial for the group to maintain cooperation.
    *   **If `P_D_t` is above a certain *defection threshold* (e.g., `d_thresh = 0.50`)**: Defect (D) in round `t+1`. This indicates significant defection from the group, and a punitive response is warranted to deter further exploitation.
    *   **If `P_D_t` is between `c_thresh` and `d_thresh` (i.e., mild defection)**: The strategy will adopt a *gradual escalation* approach. It will defect in round `t+1` if the average payoff per player in the *previous round* `t` was below a certain target cooperative payoff.
        *   Let `AvgPayoff_t = Σ(i=1 to n) π_i,t / n`.
        *   Let `TargetCoopPayoff = 0 + (k/n) * n = k` (the payoff from full cooperation).
        *   **If `AvgPayoff_t < TargetCoopPayoff`**: Defect (D) in round `t+1`. This is a signal that the group is not achieving its full cooperative potential, and a more assertive stance is needed.
        *   **Else (`AvgPayoff_t >= TargetCoopPayoff`)**: Cooperate (C) in round `t+1`. The group is still doing well, so maintain cooperative behavior.

**Summary of Decision Rules:**

The strategy decides to play C or D in round `t+1` based on the outcome of round `t`:

*   **Play C in `t+1` IF:**
    *   The proportion of defectors in round `t` (`P_D_t`) is **low** (e.g., `< 0.25`).
    *   OR, the proportion of defectors is moderate, but the average payoff in round `t` was **at or above** the full cooperation payoff (`k`).

*   **Play D in `t+1` IF:**
    *   The proportion of defectors in round `t` (`P_D_t`) is **high** (e.g., `> 0.50`).
    *   OR, the proportion of defectors is moderate, and the average payoff in round `t` was **below** the full cooperation payoff (`k`).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1): Cooperate (C)**. This is the "nice" move that initiates cooperation and signals a willingness to work together. It aligns with the cooperative mindset and gives the group a chance to start on a positive footing.

*   **Last Round (t=r): Defect (D)**. In the absolute final round, the incentive to cooperate for future gains disappears. Each player is best served by maximizing their individual payoff in this last round. Since this is a simultaneous-move game, and there's no future to influence, the rational choice for any player is to defect. This is a standard outcome in finite repeated games with a unique Nash Equilibrium in the stage game.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The strategy is inherently cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Default to Cooperation:** It starts with cooperation and only deviates when necessary.
*   **Forgiving but Firm:** It doesn't immediately retaliate against single defections. It requires a sustained or significant level of defection to trigger a switch to defection.
*   **Punishment is Proportional and Retributive:** When it defects, it's a response to the group's behavior. The goal of defecting is to punish defection and incentivize a return to cooperation, not to purely exploit.
*   **Adaptive to Group Success:** Even if there are some defectors, if the group's overall payoff is still high and close to full cooperation, it will continue to cooperate. This prioritizes collective well-being.

'''

description_COOPERATIVE_92 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive, robust, and aligned with a cooperative mindset, while only relying on game parameters and history.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Generous Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a degree of leniency to avoid perpetual cycles of mutual defection. It's inspired by Tit-for-Tat in a pairwise setting but adapted for the multi-player, repeated context.

### Core Principle:

**Start cooperatively and reciprocate the average behavior of others, but forgive occasional lapses to encourage a return to cooperation.**

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of the strategy is to assess the collective behavior of the other players and decide whether to cooperate or defect based on that assessment.

*   **Cooperate (C) if:** The average behavior of other players in the *previous round* was cooperative.
*   **Defect (D) if:** The average behavior of other players in the *previous round* was not cooperative, *but* only if this pattern of non-cooperation has persisted for a certain number of rounds.

**Detailed Decision Logic:**

1.  **Calculate the average cooperation rate of opponents in the previous round (t-1):**
    *   Let $N_{cooperators, t-1}$ be the number of players who played 'C' in round $t-1$.
    *   Let $N_{defectors, t-1}$ be the number of players who played 'D' in round $t-1$.
    *   The *opponent cooperation rate* in round $t-1$ is: $OR_{t-1} = \frac{N_{cooperators, t-1}}{n-1}$ (if $n > 1$, otherwise $OR_{t-1} = 1$ for the single opponent).

2.  **Define a "cooperation threshold":** We need a threshold to determine when the opponents' behavior is sufficiently cooperative to warrant our cooperation. This threshold should be influenced by the game parameters. A reasonable threshold could be:
    *   **Cooperation Threshold ($T$):** $\frac{k}{n}$
        *   **Rationale:** If the average contribution from others is less than the share each player receives from a single defector (which is $k/n$ on average), then contributing is not individually beneficial. Conversely, if the average contribution from others is *at least* what they'd get from a single defector, it suggests a potential for mutual gain through cooperation.

3.  **Define a "defection persistence counter":** To implement forgiveness, we need to track how many consecutive rounds the opponents have been "defecting" on average.
    *   Let $Consecutive_D$ be a counter, initialized to 0.

4.  **Decision rule for round t (where t > 1):**

    *   **If $OR_{t-1} \ge T$:**
        *   The opponents, on average, are cooperating enough.
        *   **Play C.**
        *   Reset $Consecutive_D = 0$.

    *   **Else ($OR_{t-1} < T$):**
        *   The opponents, on average, are not cooperating enough.
        *   Increment $Consecutive_D$.
        *   **If $Consecutive_D \le \text{Forgiveness\_Level}$:**
            *   Forgive this lapse and give them another chance.
            *   **Play C.**
        *   **Else ($Consecutive_D > \text{Forgiveness\_Level}$):**
            *   The pattern of defection is persistent.
            *   **Play D.**

**Determining `Forgiveness_Level`:**

The `Forgiveness_Level` should be a small integer. A good starting point could be **1 or 2**. This means we'll only defect after seeing the average opponent behavior fall below the threshold for 1 or 2 consecutive rounds. This prevents immediate retaliation for a single "mistake" but punishes sustained defection.

*   **Considerations for `Forgiveness_Level`:**
    *   Too high: Might be too forgiving and exploited.
    *   Too low: Might be too retaliatory and lead to mutual defection.
    *   A small value (1 or 2) balances robustness and cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Since there is no history, we adopt an optimistic cooperative stance.
    *   **Decision for Round 1: Play C.**
    *   Initialize $Consecutive_D = 0$.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   In a repeated game with a known finite end, the last round often incentivizes defection (similar to the one-shot game).
    *   However, our strategy is designed to be cooperative as long as possible. The decision rule for round $r$ is the same as any other round: it depends on the opponent's behavior in round $r-1$.
    *   **Decision for Round r: Apply the standard decision rule based on $OR_{r-1}$.**
    *   **Rationale for not unilaterally defecting:** Even in the last round, unilateral defection by our strategy might be suboptimal if other players *continue* to cooperate based on our past behavior. The goal is to maximize our *own* cumulative payoff, and if the history suggests cooperation is viable, we stick to it. This is more aligned with a robust cooperative strategy that doesn't collapse into defection prematurely.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** The strategy begins by cooperating, signaling a desire for mutual gain.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperative behavior from others by continuing to cooperate.
*   **Forgiveness:** It allows for occasional deviations from cooperation by opponents without immediate retaliation, providing an opportunity for them to "correct" their behavior. This is crucial for avoiding lock-in to mutual defection.
*   **Parameter-Awareness:** The cooperation threshold ($\frac{k}{n}$) is directly derived from the game's structure, ensuring the strategy is grounded in the game's incentives. It implicitly understands that higher $k$ or lower $n$ makes cooperation more individually beneficial.
*   **History-Dependent:** The strategy learns from the past, adapting its behavior based on observed trends, making it robust to varied opponent strategies.

This strategy is designed to be a strong cooperative contender. It aims to establish and maintain cooperation by being predictable, fair, and forgiving. Its strength lies in its ability to recover from temporary dips in cooperation without immediately collapsing into a mutual defection trap.

## Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Enhanced Forgiveness and Conditional Cooperation

This strategy is a variation of the classic Tit-for-Tat, adapted for a multi-player, repeated setting. It aims to promote cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a built-in mechanism to recover from periods of low cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round *t* for player *i* depends on the actions of all players in the previous round (*t-1*) and the overall level of cooperation observed throughout the game.

**Core Logic:**

*   **If the average contribution in the previous round was sufficiently high, Cooperate.**
*   **Otherwise, Defect.**

**Defining "Sufficiently High" Average Contribution:**

The threshold for "sufficiently high" average contribution is dynamic and directly influenced by the game parameters. We define a target cooperation level.

*   **Target Cooperation Level (TCL):** The ideal scenario for cooperation is when all players cooperate. In this case, the total contribution is *n*. The payoff for each player is $(k/n) \times n = k$. If everyone defects, the payoff is 1. Therefore, for cooperation to be individually rational at least in the long run, *k* must be greater than 1, which is already a condition of the game.

    To encourage cooperation, we want to aim for a level of cooperation that *guarantees* a payoff greater than or equal to what a player would receive by defecting against a certain level of cooperation.

    Let $C_{t-1}$ be the number of cooperators in round $t-1$.
    The payoff for a cooperator in round $t-1$ was $(k/n) \times C_{t-1}$.
    The payoff for a defector in round $t-1$ was $1 + (k/n) \times C_{t-1}$.

    For a player to consider cooperating, their expected payoff from cooperating must be at least as good as their payoff from defecting, given the actions of others. A simplified approach is to consider the minimum payoff a cooperator can receive. When all players play D, the payoff is 1. When all players play C, the payoff is $k$.

    We aim for a proportion of cooperators that ensures the payoff for a cooperator is greater than or equal to the payoff for a defector if the number of cooperators is *below* a certain threshold.

    Let's define our **Cooperation Threshold (CT)**. We will cooperate if the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was at least CT. A sensible CT would be one that ensures that if cooperation drops below this level, individual defection becomes more appealing.

    Consider the payoff for a cooperator: $(k/n) \times \text{total\_cooperators}$.
    Consider the payoff for a defector: $1 + (k/n) \times \text{total\_cooperators}$.

    We want to cooperate if the average payoff for a cooperator is at least as good as the average payoff for a defector *if* the number of cooperators is low.

    A more direct approach: If the total number of cooperators in the previous round, $\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{j, t-1}$, is greater than or equal to a defined **Cooperation Threshold (CT)**, player *i* will play C. Otherwise, player *i* will play D.

    **Determining the Cooperation Threshold (CT):**

    The optimal CT is not fixed and should reflect the game's parameters. A good starting point is to consider the "tipping point" where cooperation becomes significantly less rewarding for individuals.

    If the total number of cooperators is *x*, a cooperator gets $(k/n) \times x$ and a defector gets $1 + (k/n) \times x$.
    For cooperation to be beneficial for all, we need $(k/n) \times x > 1$ for a significant portion of players.

    A robust CT can be set as:
    $$ \text{CT} = \lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil $$
    This threshold is derived from the idea that if the number of cooperators falls below this value, the term $(k/n) \times \text{total\_cooperators}$ will be less than 1, meaning a defector (who keeps their endowment of 1) would fare better than a cooperator. If the number of cooperators is at or above $\lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil$, then $(k/n) \times \text{total\_cooperators} \ge 1$, meaning a cooperator receives at least their endowment back. This threshold directly links cooperation to individual payoff guarantees.

**Decision Rule Summary:**

In round *t* (where *t* > 1):
*   If $\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{j, t-1} \ge \lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil$, then player *i* plays **C**.
*   Otherwise, player *i* plays **D**.

**Adaptive Element (Forgiveness):**

While the above is the core logic, a purely punitive strategy can get stuck in a cycle of defection. To be more cooperative, we introduce a slight forgiveness mechanism. If the game has experienced periods of high cooperation in the past, we can be more lenient.

*   **Cooperation Streak Counter:** Maintain a counter, `cooperation_streak`, that increments when the total number of cooperators in a round is above the TCL and resets to 0 when it falls below.
*   **Forgiveness Threshold:** Define a `forgiveness_threshold`. If `cooperation_streak` exceeds this threshold, we might be willing to cooperate even if the previous round's cooperation was slightly below the CT.

**Revised Decision Rule with Forgiveness:**

In round *t* (where *t* > 1):
1.  Calculate the number of cooperators in the previous round: `prev_cooperators = sum(c_{j, t-1} for all j)`.
2.  Define the **Cooperation Threshold (CT)**: $CT = \lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil$.
3.  Define a **Forgiveness Window (FW)**. This can be a small number, e.g., 1 or 2.
4.  Define a **Minimum Cooperation Boost (MCB)**. This is a small addition to the CT to trigger forgiveness, e.g., 1 or 2.

5.  **Decision:**
    *   If `prev_cooperators` >= CT, then play **C**.
    *   Else if `prev_cooperators` >= (CT - MCB) AND `cooperation_streak` >= FW, then play **C**. (This is the forgiveness step: if cooperation was only slightly below the threshold but we've had a good streak, we'll try to cooperate).
    *   Else (if neither of the above conditions is met), then play **D**.

    **Updating `cooperation_streak`:**
    *   If `prev_cooperators` >= CT, increment `cooperation_streak`.
    *   Else, reset `cooperation_streak = 0`.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    In the absence of any history, the most cooperative and optimistic approach is to **Cooperate (C)**. This sets a positive tone and signals a willingness to cooperate. It also allows for the possibility of establishing a cooperative equilibrium if others also start cooperatively.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    In the repeated game, there is a temptation to defect in the last round because there are no future repercussions. However, the goal of this strategy is to be cooperative. Therefore, the strategy should **Cooperate (C)** in the last round. This maintains the cooperative spirit and does not "punish" past cooperation. If the tournament designers punish last-round defection more severely, this strategy will be disadvantaged. But adhering to the "cooperative" principle means continuing to cooperate until the very end.

*   **All Players Defecting Simultaneously (Stuck in Defection):**
    The forgiveness mechanism is designed to help escape from a state where everyone is defecting. If the `cooperation_streak` is low and `prev_cooperators` is also low, the strategy will defect. However, if *any* player deviates and cooperates (leading to `prev_cooperators` being at least 1), and the `cooperation_streak` has been sufficiently long in the past, the forgiveness mechanism might kick in and allow us to cooperate again, potentially re-establishing a cooperative cycle.

### 3. Being Cooperative

*   **Default Action:** The strategy's default behavior, especially in the first round and when past behavior warrants it, is to **Cooperate**.
*   **Conditional Defection:** Defection is not punitive for the sake of punishment, but a necessary response to a sustained lack of collective cooperation. It aims to signal that individual defection is not beneficial for the group.
*   **Resilience:** The forgiveness mechanism ensures that a temporary dip in cooperation doesn't permanently derail the strategy's cooperative intent. It's willing to give cooperation another chance after a period of good behavior.
*   **No Exploitation:** The strategy does not aim to exploit "naive" cooperators. It cooperates when it believes collective action is sustainable and beneficial.

            # High cooperation in previous round, definitely cooperate
            return 'C'
        elif prev_cooperators >= (self.cooperation_threshold - self.min_cooperation_boost) and self.cooperation_streak >= self.forgiveness_window:
            # Slightly below threshold, but we've had a good streak - forgive and cooperate
            return 'C'

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Components:**

*   `n, r, k`: Game parameters.
*   `cooperation_threshold`: Calculated as $\lceil n/k \rceil$. `max(1, ...)` ensures it's at least 1, as you can't have less than 1 cooperator.
*   `forgiveness_window`: How many consecutive rounds of cooperation above the threshold are needed to enable forgiveness.
*   `min_cooperation_boost`: How far below the `cooperation_threshold` we are willing to go to still cooperate if the `forgiveness_window` is met.
*   `cooperation_streak`: Counts consecutive rounds where cooperation met or exceeded the `cooperation_threshold`.
*   `decide_action(current_round, history)`:
    *   Checks for the first round and returns 'C'.
    *   Calculates `prev_cooperators` from the `history`.
    *   Updates `cooperation_streak` based on whether the `cooperation_threshold` was met in the previous round.
    *   Applies the decision logic: cooperate if cooperation was high, or if it was slightly low but the `cooperation_streak` is long enough (forgiveness). Otherwise, defect.
*   `reset()`: Clears the `cooperation_streak` to start fresh.

This strategy aims to balance the desire for collective benefit through cooperation with the need for self-preservation against free-riders. Its adaptive nature allows it to respond to changing dynamics while its core cooperative intent remains.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_94 = '''
Here's a design for a cooperative, adaptive, and robust strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on natural language description and pseudocode.

## Strategy: "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a crucial element of forgiveness to allow for the re-establishment of cooperation after periods of defection. It is designed to be resilient to a variety of opponent behaviors without assuming any specific coordination mechanisms.

### Core Philosophy:

The fundamental belief behind this strategy is that sustained cooperation, when reciprocated, leads to the highest collective and individual payoffs in this game (as seen in the example where all cooperate, resulting in a payoff of 2 per player compared to 1 if all defect). However, pure altruism is vulnerable to exploitation. Therefore, the strategy will cooperate when it believes others are likely to reciprocate, and defect when it detects defection, but will gradually forgive to avoid getting stuck in low-payoff cycles.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round is based on a weighted assessment of past behavior, aiming to infer the general inclination of the other players.

**Key Components of the Decision Rule:**

*   **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** A dynamic threshold representing the minimum perceived level of cooperation among other players that will trigger cooperation from our player.
*   **Defection Penalty (DP):** A mechanism to punish defection, causing our player to defect for a certain number of rounds.
*   **Forgiveness Factor (FF):** A mechanism to gradually reduce the penalty for past defections, allowing for the re-establishment of cooperation.

**Detailed Decision Logic:**

In round `t`:

*   **Initial State (High Trust):** At the beginning of the game, and after periods of consistent cooperation, the strategy will lean towards cooperation.
*   **Monitoring Opponent Behavior:** The strategy will track the proportion of other players who cooperated in recent rounds.
*   **Triggering Defection:** If the observed average cooperation rate among other players falls below a certain tolerance level (indicating widespread defection), the strategy will switch to defecting.
*   **Punishment Phase:** Once defection is triggered, the strategy will continue to defect for a predetermined number of rounds (the "punishment duration"). This serves as a signal that defection is not tolerated.
*   **Gradual Forgiveness:** After the punishment duration, the strategy will begin to gradually increase its tolerance for defection. It will start by cooperating with a higher probability, and this probability will increase with each subsequent round of observed cooperation from others. This allows the group to potentially return to a cooperative state even if one or more players defected.

**Specific Thresholds and Mechanics:**

Let's define some variables to capture these concepts:

*   `last_cooperation_round`: The round number where our player last cooperated.
*   `consecutive_defections_by_others`: The number of consecutive rounds where the *average* cooperation rate among other players has been below our threshold.
*   `punishment_rounds_remaining`: The number of rounds left in the current punishment phase.
*   `forgiveness_level`: A value indicating how close we are to fully forgiving past defections.

**Decision Rule in Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Global variables for the strategy
var n: integer // number of players
var r: integer // number of rounds
var k: float // multiplication factor

var my_last_action: {C, D} = D // Initialize to defect, to be safe initially
var history: list of dictionaries, each entry: {round_num: int, player_actions: dict, player_payoffs: dict}

// Strategy-specific state variables
var consecutive_defections_by_others = 0
var punishment_rounds_remaining = 0
var forgiveness_level = 0.0 // 0.0 means no forgiveness, 1.0 means full forgiveness

// Parameters to tune (can be determined through meta-learning or reasonable defaults)
const PUNISHMENT_DURATION = max(2, round(r * 0.1)) // Punish for at least 2 rounds, or 10% of total rounds
const COOPERATION_TOLERANCE = 0.5 // If less than 50% of others cooperate, consider it widespread defection
const FORGIVENESS_RATE = 0.1 // How much forgiveness level increases per round of observed cooperation
const INITIAL_COOPERATION_BIAS = 0.8 // Probability of cooperating initially or after good behavior

function decide_action(current_round: int, game_history: list): {C, D}
    // 1. Analyze past behavior of others
    var total_other_players = n - 1
    var observed_cooperation_rate = 0.0
    if current_round > 1:
        var last_round_data = game_history[current_round - 2] // Access the previous round's data (index is 0-based)
        var num_others_cooperated = 0
        for each player_id, action in last_round_data.player_actions:
            if player_id != my_id: // Assuming we know our own ID
                if action == C:
                    num_others_cooperated += 1
        observed_cooperation_rate = num_others_cooperated / total_other_players

    // 2. Update state variables based on observed behavior
    if punishment_rounds_remaining > 0:
        punishment_rounds_remaining -= 1
        // While in punishment, we always defect
        my_last_action = D
        consecutive_defections_by_others = 0 // Reset count as we are the ones punishing
        forgiveness_level = 0.0 // Reset forgiveness during punishment
        return D

    if observed_cooperation_rate < COOPERATION_TOLERANCE and current_round > 1:
        consecutive_defections_by_others += 1
        // Widespread defection detected, initiate punishment
        if consecutive_defections_by_others >= 2: // Trigger punishment after 2 rounds of low cooperation
            punishment_rounds_remaining = PUNISHMENT_DURATION
            consecutive_defections_by_others = 0 // Reset count for the next potential cycle
            forgiveness_level = 0.0 // Reset forgiveness when punishing
            my_last_action = D
            return D
    else:
        consecutive_defections_by_others = 0 // Reset defection count if cooperation improves

    // 3. Incorporate forgiveness
    if consecutive_defections_by_others == 0 and current_round > 1: // If no active defection count
        forgiveness_level = min(1.0, forgiveness_level + FORGIVENESS_RATE) // Gradually increase forgiveness
    else:
        forgiveness_level = 0.0 // Reset forgiveness if there's an ongoing defection detection

    // 4. Make the final decision
    var cooperation_probability = INITIAL_COOPERATION_BIAS * (1 - (1 - forgiveness_level) * (1 - observed_cooperation_rate))

    // Adjust probability based on initial rounds and overall game state
    if current_round <= 2: // Strong bias towards cooperation early on
        cooperation_probability = INITIAL_COOPERATION_BIAS

    // Introduce some randomness to explore and adapt
    var random_number = random() // Generates a random float between 0.0 and 1.0

    if random_number < cooperation_probability:
        my_last_action = C
        return C
    else:
        my_last_action = D
        return D

// Note: 'my_id' needs to be defined and passed to this function or be globally accessible.
// The 'game_history' would need to be structured to contain actions and payoffs for all players per round.
```

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (r=1):** In the very first round, there is no history. To be cooperative while minimizing immediate risk, the strategy will have a high probability of cooperating. This is controlled by `INITIAL_COOPERATION_BIAS`. A value of 0.8 means it will cooperate 80% of the time.
*   **Last Round (r=r):** The last round is crucial. Since there are no future rounds to influence, the incentive structure shifts. A purely rational player might defect in the last round to maximize their individual payoff. However, our "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness" strategy doesn't have a specific "last round override." It will follow its established decision rules. If the history has led to a high `forgiveness_level` and `observed_cooperation_rate` is decent, it will still cooperate. If it's in a punishment phase, it will defect. This allows for a more consistent, albeit potentially suboptimal in the very last round, behavior that reinforces long-term norms.
*   **Low `n` (e.g., n=2):** The strategy adapts naturally. `total_other_players` will be 1. `observed_cooperation_rate` will simply be 1.0 if the single other player cooperates, and 0.0 if they defect. This makes the strategy highly responsive in duels.
*   **High `k` relative to `n`:** This generally makes cooperation more beneficial. The strategy will likely enter and maintain cooperative states more easily, as the rewards for collective action are higher.
*   **Low `k` relative to `n`:** This makes defection more tempting as the cost of contributing to the public good is higher. The strategy will be more likely to detect defection and enter punishment phases, but the forgiveness mechanism is still key to recovering.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Default to Cooperation:** The `INITIAL_COOPERATION_BIAS` ensures that the strategy starts with a cooperative stance, hoping to establish a positive norm.
*   **Reciprocity:** The core of the strategy is reciprocity. It rewards cooperation with more cooperation and punishes defection with defection. This is a cornerstone of many successful cooperative strategies in repeated games.
*   **Forgiveness:** The `forgiveness_level` is the defining characteristic of this strategy's cooperative nature. It acknowledges that occasional defections might be mistakes or due to transient conditions, and provides a pathway back to cooperation. This prevents the game from getting stuck in an indefinitely suboptimal state of mutual defection.
*   **Adaptive Equilibrium:** The strategy aims to guide the group towards a cooperative equilibrium (all C) but is robust enough to recover from suboptimal states (e.g., many D, few C). The hope is that by consistently signaling a willingness to cooperate *if others do*, it will eventually influence the overall group behavior.

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Opponent Behaviors:**
    *   **Always Cooperate:** The strategy will reciprocate and likely maintain cooperation.
    *   **Always Defect:** The strategy will detect defection, enter punishment, and will likely remain in a cycle of defection for a while. However, the forgiveness mechanism is designed to eventually break this if the "Always Defect" player ever changes their mind (though in this specific case, they won't).
    *   **Tit-for-Tat:** This strategy is generally compatible with Tit-for-Tat. It will cooperate if Tit-for-Tat cooperates and defect if Tit-for-Tat defects. The forgiveness mechanism might lead to more sustained cooperation than pure Tit-for-Tat if the opponent defects occasionally.
    *   **Random Players:** The `COOPERATION_TOLERANCE` will be hit frequently, leading to punishment. However, the gradual forgiveness will allow for recovery if there are periods of higher cooperation.
    *   **Generous Tit-for-Tat:** This strategy would likely thrive, as it would maintain cooperation even if the opponent defects once.

*   **Adaptability:** The dynamic nature of `punishment_rounds_remaining` and `forgiveness_level`, influenced by observed opponent behavior, makes the strategy adaptive. It doesn't have fixed rules for every situation but adjusts its behavior based on the current state of the game as inferred from history.

This "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness" strategy offers a balanced approach, prioritizing long-term collective well-being while protecting itself from exploitation, and crucially, providing a mechanism for recovery and re-establishment of cooperation.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_95 = '''
This N-Player Public Goods Game presents an interesting challenge for cooperative strategy design in a repeated setting. The core tension lies between individual incentives to defect for a higher immediate payoff and the collective benefit of cooperation. Given the parameters (1 < k < n), defecting is always individually rational in a *single* round. However, the repeated nature and perfect information open the door for strategies that can foster cooperation.

Here's a proposed cooperative strategy, designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Group Threshold

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a crucial modification to address the N-player dynamic. It’s inspired by Tit-for-Tat but adapted for a group setting where individual defection might be masked by others' cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules

**Core Principle:** Cooperate as long as the group, on average, cooperates enough to make it mutually beneficial. Defect if the group's cooperative effort falls below a critical threshold.

**Formalizing the Threshold:**
The condition for mutual benefit from cooperation in a single round is when the payoff for cooperating is greater than or equal to the payoff for defecting, assuming all other players' actions are fixed.
Let $N_C$ be the number of cooperators.
If player $i$ cooperates: $\pi_i = (k/n) \times N_C$
If player $i$ defects: $\pi_i = 1 + (k/n) \times (N_C - 1)$ (assuming player $i$ was one of the cooperators, otherwise $\pi_i = 1 + (k/n) \times N_C$)

For cooperation to be potentially beneficial for player $i$, even if others defect, they would want to see a certain level of total contribution. A key observation is that cooperation becomes individually rational when $(k/n) \times N_C \ge 1$. This implies $N_C \ge n/k$. Since $k < n$, $n/k > 1$.

However, the *group* benefits most when *everyone* cooperates. A reasonable threshold for encouraging sustained cooperation is when the average payoff from cooperation for the group is greater than the average payoff from defection.
Let's consider the scenario where $N_C$ players cooperate and $n-N_C$ players defect.
Average payoff for a cooperator: $(k/n) \times N_C$
Average payoff for a defector: $1 + (k/n) \times (N_C - 1)$

Cooperation is generally beneficial for the *group* when the total payoff is maximized by everyone cooperating. The total payoff when everyone cooperates is $n \times (k/n) \times n = nk$. The total payoff when everyone defects is $n \times 1 = n$. Since $k > 1$, $nk > n$, so universal cooperation is best for the group.

**Decision Rule for Player i in Round t (t > 1):**

*   **Cooperate (C):** If the proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round ($t-1$) was greater than or equal to a "Cooperation Threshold" ($T$).
*   **Defect (D):** If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round ($t-1$) was less than the "Cooperation Threshold" ($T$).

**What is the Cooperation Threshold ($T$)?**

A robust threshold should reflect the condition where collective cooperation starts to become demonstrably better than collective defection for the group's overall well-being. A good candidate for this threshold is the proportion of players that would need to cooperate for cooperation to be individually rational for *everyone*, i.e., $1/k$.
So, $T = 1/k$.

This means if at least $1/k$ of the players cooperated in the previous round, we assume enough collective benefit is being generated to warrant continuing cooperation.

**Refined Decision Rule:**

*   **If Round t = 1:** Cooperate. (See Edge Cases)
*   **If Round t > 1:**
    *   Let $C_{t-1}$ be the number of players who cooperated in round $t-1$.
    *   Calculate the proportion of cooperators in the previous round: $P_{t-1} = C_{t-1} / n$.
    *   **If $P_{t-1} \ge 1/k$**: Play **C**.
    *   **If $P_{t-1} < 1/k$**: Play **D**.

This strategy is adaptive because it reacts to the collective behavior of the group in the preceding round. It is robust because it doesn't punish every single instance of defection, but rather reacts to sustained deviations from a "cooperatively beneficial" level of contribution.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative stance is to initiate cooperation. This sets a positive example and provides an opportunity for mutual cooperation to emerge. It also aligns with the "Be cooperative" principle.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the standard "end-game" problem in repeated games. Since there are no future rounds to punish or reward, the incentive structure reverts to the single-round game where defection is individually rational. To maximize one's own payoff in the final round, defecting is the optimal choice. This is a necessary concession to game theory realities in the absence of a binding agreement or a strong reputational mechanism extending beyond the game.

*   **All Players Cooperated in the Previous Round ($C_{t-1} = n$):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The condition $P_{t-1} = n/n = 1 \ge 1/k$ will always hold (since $k > 1$). This simply reinforces the core rule and signals satisfaction with the current cooperative state.

*   **No Players Cooperated in the Previous Round ($C_{t-1} = 0$):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The condition $P_{t-1} = 0/n = 0 < 1/k$ will always hold (since $k > 1$). This will trigger a defection, which is appropriate given the complete collapse of cooperation. However, this defection is a reaction to the group's failure, not an aggressive first move.

### 3. Be Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative in spirit:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** It starts by choosing cooperation, aiming to unlock the potential for mutual benefit.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the collective effort demonstrates a commitment to the public good, as measured by the proportion of cooperators exceeding the $1/k$ threshold.
*   **Gentle Punishment:** It only defects when the collective effort falls below a level that is demonstrably beneficial for sustained cooperation. This punishment is not vindictive; it's a response to a failure in collective action that makes cooperation less advantageous.
*   **Focus on Group Outcome:** The threshold $1/k$ is derived from the condition where cooperation starts becoming individually rational, suggesting an implicit understanding of collective benefit.

        self.cooperation_threshold = 1.0 / k_factor # T = 1/k

    def decide_action(self, current_round, history):

            # Analyze previous round's actions
            previous_round_actions = history[current_round - 1]
            cooperators_in_previous_round = previous_round_actions.count('C')
            proportion_cooperators = cooperators_in_previous_round / self.n

            if proportion_cooperators >= self.cooperation_threshold:
                return 'C'
            else:
                return 'D'

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

*   `n_players`, `k_factor`, `num_rounds`: Game parameters.
*   `cooperation_threshold`: Calculated once at initialization.
*   `decide_action(current_round, history)`: This is the core function.
    *   `current_round`: The 0-indexed current round number.
    *   `history`: A list of lists representing past actions. `history[i]` is a list of actions taken by all players in round `i`.
*   **First Round Handling:** If `current_round` is 0, return 'C'.
*   **Last Round Handling:** If `current_round` is `self.r - 1`, return 'D'.
*   **Subsequent Rounds:**
    *   It retrieves the actions from the `current_round - 1`.
    *   Counts the number of 'C's.
    *   Calculates the proportion of cooperators.
    *   Compares this proportion to the `cooperation_threshold`.
    *   Returns 'C' if the proportion meets or exceeds the threshold, 'D' otherwise.

This strategy balances the desire to foster cooperation with a realistic understanding of individual incentives and the challenges of coordinating in a large group over a finite number of rounds.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_96 = '''
This cooperative strategy, which I'll call "Adaptive Reciprocity," aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to various opponent behaviors. It's designed to be robust and aligned with a cooperative mindset.

## Adaptive Reciprocity Strategy

The core idea of Adaptive Reciprocity is to start with cooperation and maintain it as long as others do. However, it incorporates a mechanism to punish defection and a path back to cooperation once trust is re-established.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to cooperate (C) or defect (D) is based on two main factors:

*   **The prevailing cooperation rate in the previous round:** This provides a signal about the general behavior of other players.
*   **The immediate history of defection:** If a player defects, we need to respond.

Here's how the decision rules are structured:

*   **Default Action: Cooperate (C)**
    *   The strategy begins by assuming cooperation is beneficial and will default to playing 'C' in any situation where a clear signal for defection is absent.

*   **Responding to Widespread Cooperation:**
    *   If the *proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round is greater than or equal to a threshold `T_coop`*, then play **C**.
    *   `T_coop` is a parameter that represents the minimum level of observed cooperation needed to continue cooperating. This threshold will be set to a value slightly above the critical point where individual defection becomes rational.

*   **Responding to Widespread Defection or Low Cooperation:**
    *   If the *proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round is less than `T_coop`*, then play **D**. This is a punitive measure to signal that defection is not tolerated and to encourage future cooperation by making sustained defection costly for everyone.

*   **Responding to Individual Defection (and Gradual Return to Cooperation):**
    *   This is the adaptive part. If we observe that *at least one player defected in the previous round*, and the overall cooperation rate is borderline (e.g., between `T_coop` and a slightly lower threshold `T_punish`), we will enter a "punishment" phase.
    *   During the punishment phase, if an opponent has defected against us in the *immediately preceding round*, we will defect against them in the current round. This is a tit-for-tat like mechanism at the individual level, but applied within the broader adaptive framework.
    *   However, we will still monitor the overall cooperation rate. If the overall cooperation rate starts to rise again (e.g., crosses `T_coop` upwards), we will gradually forgive past defections and return to full cooperation.

**Parameter Definitions for Decision Rules:**

*   `T_coop`: A float, representing the minimum proportion of cooperators in the previous round required to continue cooperating. For example, if `n=6` and `k=2`, the payoff for cooperating when everyone else defects is `0 + (2/6)*1 = 0.33`, while defecting yields `1 + (2/6)*0 = 1`. The payoff for cooperating when everyone cooperates is `0 + (2/6)*6 = 2`, while defecting yields `1 + (2/6)*5 = 1 + 1.67 = 2.67`. A value for `T_coop` around `0.8 * n` (i.e., 80% of players cooperating) might be a good starting point.
*   `T_punish`: A float, a slightly lower threshold than `T_coop`. If cooperation falls below this, we become more aggressive in punishment.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   In the absence of any history, the strategy defaults to **C**. This is the most cooperative starting point and encourages others to do the same.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   In the last round, there is no future to incentivize. Therefore, the rational action for any player is to defect. The Adaptive Reciprocity strategy will also play **D** in the last round, regardless of history. This is because there's no benefit to maintaining cooperation if there are no subsequent rounds where that cooperation could be reciprocated.

*   **Rounds Near the End (e.g., t = r-1, r-2):**
    *   As the game approaches its end, the incentive to cooperate diminishes. The strategy will dynamically adjust its thresholds. For rounds `t > 1` and `t < r`, the strategy will behave as described in the decision rules. However, as `t` approaches `r`, the effective `T_coop` might be implicitly raised, pushing towards defection sooner. A more explicit way to handle this would be to dynamically adjust `T_coop` based on `(r - t) / r`.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The "cooperative mindset" is embedded in the strategy through:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by cooperating, setting a positive example.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation with cooperation and punishes defection. This is not pure altruism, but a form of conditional cooperation that aims to create a mutually beneficial outcome.
*   **Forgiveness (Adaptive Return):** The strategy is not vindictive. While it punishes defection, it's willing to return to cooperation if the overall behavior of the group shifts back towards cooperation. This allows for the re-establishment of cooperative norms.
*   **Focus on Group Outcome:** By responding to the *overall cooperation rate*, the strategy implicitly acknowledges that collective benefit is achieved through widespread cooperation.

**Explanation of the Refined Pseudocode Logic:**

The pseudocode has been refined to be more clearly "cooperative" and robust. The key is that the strategy will always lean towards cooperation unless cooperation rates fall to a point where collective benefit is clearly compromised (below `T_punish`) or it's the last round. The idea of individual tit-for-tat in borderline scenarios was removed because it can easily devolve into mutual defection, which is not cooperative.

Instead, the strategy focuses on:

1.  **Starting cooperatively.**
2.  **Continuing to cooperate as long as the overall cooperation rate is high enough (`>= T_coop`).**
3.  **Punishing with widespread defection (`< T_punish`) if the group descends into low cooperation.**
4.  **Gracefully returning to cooperation if the group starts cooperating again, even if there were past defections.**

This strategy is adaptive because it responds to the observed behavior of the group. It's robust because it has clear thresholds and a defined response to different levels of cooperation. It's cooperative by prioritizing cooperation and having a mechanism to re-establish it.

## Cooperative Strategy: The Adaptive Punisher

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while being mindful of the repeated nature of the game and the possibility of future cooperation. It is designed to be robust to various opponent behaviors by adapting its punitive response over time.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Initial Optimism:** Start with an assumption of cooperative intent.
2.  **Punish Deviations:** Respond to defection by defecting, but with a mechanism to re-evaluate cooperation.
3.  **Forgive and Forget (with caution):** Allow for a return to cooperation if opponents show consistent cooperative behavior.
4.  **Parameter Awareness:** Leverage the knowledge of `n` and `k` to understand the incentives for cooperation.

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Punisher

### 1. Decision Rules:

Our strategy will make decisions round by round based on the observed behavior of *all other players* in the *previous round*.

**Decision Rule for Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

Let `N_C(t-1)` be the number of players who cooperated in round `t-1` (excluding yourself).
Let `N_D(t-1)` be the number of players who defected in round `t-1` (excluding yourself).

*   **If `N_C(t-1) == n - 1` (all other players cooperated in the previous round):**
    *   **Play C (Cooperate).** This reinforces cooperative behavior.

*   **If `N_C(t-1) < n - 1` AND `N_D(t-1) > 0` (at least one other player defected in the previous round):**
    *   **Consider Defecting.** The decision to defect here is nuanced and depends on our "Punishment Level". Let's introduce a state variable: `PunishmentLevel`.
        *   **If `PunishmentLevel == 0` (no active punishment):**
            *   **Play D (Defect).** This is the initial response to defection.
            *   **Increase `PunishmentLevel` by 1.**
        *   **If `PunishmentLevel > 0` (currently in a punishment phase):**
            *   **Play D (Defect).** Continue to punish.
            *   **Increment `PunishmentLevel` by 1.**

*   **If `N_C(t-1) == n - 1` AND `PunishmentLevel > 0` (all other players cooperated, but we are in a punishment phase):**
    *   **Play C (Cooperate).** This is crucial for re-establishing cooperation after a punishment phase.
    *   **Reset `PunishmentLevel` to 0.** This signifies that the punishment phase is over, and we are giving another chance for cooperation.

**Key Idea:** The `PunishmentLevel` acts as a memory of past defections. It allows for a period of sustained punishment but also incorporates a mechanism for recovery and re-evaluation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t = 1`):**
    *   **Play C (Cooperate).** Our initial stance is to lead by example and explore the cooperative outcome. We assume no prior history to base a punitive action on.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   **Play D (Defect).** In the final round, there is no future to incentivize. The dominant strategy in a single-round public goods game is to defect, as the payoff from defecting is always higher for an individual, regardless of others' actions, when `k < n`. Since there's no future round to be punished or to be rewarded for cooperation, defection maximizes individual gain.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

Our strategy is inherently cooperative in spirit because:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** We always start by cooperating, hoping for the mutually beneficial outcome.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** We continue to cooperate as long as others do, demonstrating a desire for a sustained cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Adaptive Punishment, Not Retaliation:** Our punishment is not eternal. The `PunishmentLevel` is designed to be a temporary measure. We are willing to forgive and return to cooperation once other players demonstrate a sustained commitment to cooperating. This is a crucial aspect of fostering long-term cooperation.
*   **Maximizing Total Welfare (Implicitly):** While we are self-interested agents in a game, the cooperative strategy, when successful, leads to the highest possible total payoff for all players (everyone getting 2 in the example `n=6, k=2`). Our strategy aims to reach and maintain this state.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Game Parameters
n: integer (number of players)
r: integer (number of rounds)
k: float (multiplication factor)

// State Variables
PunishmentLevel: integer (initially 0)

// Strategy Function for Player i in Round t
function AdaptivePunisher(player_id, t, history):
  // history is a list of lists, where history[t'][p] is player p's action in round t'
  // history[t'][i] is player i's own action in round t'

  // Handle the last round
  if t == r:
    return D

  // Handle the first round
  if t == 1:
    PunishmentLevel = 0 // Ensure punishment level is reset for a fresh start
    return C

  // For rounds t > 1 and t < r:

  // Count other players' actions in the previous round (t-1)
  num_cooperators_others = 0
  num_defectors_others = 0
  for player_j in range(1, n + 1):
    if player_j != player_id:
      if history[t-1][player_j] == C:
        num_cooperators_others += 1
      else:
        num_defectors_others += 1

  // Decision Logic
  if num_cooperators_others == n - 1: // All other players cooperated
    if PunishmentLevel > 0:
      PunishmentLevel = 0 // Reset punishment if cooperation returns
    return C
  else: // At least one other player defected
    if PunishmentLevel == 0: // First time facing defection or recovering from cooperation
      PunishmentLevel = 1
      return D
    else: // Already in a punishment phase
      PunishmentLevel += 1
      return D

// End of Strategy Function

```

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Against Always Defect (ALLD):** If all opponents are ALLD, our strategy will eventually defect and continue to do so until the last round. The `PunishmentLevel` will increase, but this is an appropriate response to sustained defection.
*   **Against Tit-for-Tat (TFT):** If opponents play TFT, they will mirror our actions. If we start with C, they'll play C. We will continue playing C, and they will too, leading to mutual cooperation until the last round. If, for some reason, we were to defect (e.g., due to noise or a different strategy's influence), the TFT player would also defect, and our `PunishmentLevel` would increase, leading to a reciprocal defection phase. However, if cooperation resumes, our strategy will forgive and return to C.
*   **Against Grim Trigger:** Grim Trigger cooperates until the first defection, then defects forever. Our strategy is more forgiving. If an opponent plays Grim Trigger and defects, we will also defect, increasing `PunishmentLevel`. However, if *other* players (besides the Grim Trigger player) *then* return to cooperation, our strategy will reset `PunishmentLevel` and return to C, while the Grim Trigger player will continue to defect. This shows our strategy's ability to adapt to evolving group dynamics.
*   **Against Random Play:** Our strategy will react to the random behavior. If random actions lead to periods of cooperation, we will reward it. If they lead to defection, we will punish, but eventually offer a chance to return to cooperation.

This Adaptive Punisher strategy aims to balance the desire for cooperation with the need to defend against exploitation, making it a strong candidate for a cooperative strategy in a multi-agent tournament.

Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust in a repeated interaction setting without explicit communication.

## Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Punishment and Forgiveness (ATFP)

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it, punishing defection, and showing a willingness to return to cooperation after a period of punishment. It's built upon the core idea of "reciprocity" but with added mechanisms to handle group dynamics and maintain long-term cooperative potential.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Cooperation as Default:** The strategy generally favors cooperation, as this is the only way to achieve higher group payoffs.
2.  **Reciprocity:** Respond to past behavior, but with some leniency.
3.  **Punishment:** Defect strategically to deter future defection.
4.  **Forgiveness:** Do not punish indefinitely, allowing for a return to cooperation.
5.  **Parameter Awareness:** Leverage the game parameters ($n$, $k$, $r$) to inform decisions.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to cooperate (C) or defect (D) is based on a combination of the current round number, the historical behavior of the group, and a "punishment phase."

**Key Variables:**

*   `my_history`: A list or array storing the player's own actions in past rounds (1 for C, 0 for D).
*   `group_cooperation_rate`: The average cooperation rate of all players in the previous round. This will be calculated by summing the `c_j` values for all players in the previous round and dividing by `n`.
*   `punishment_level`: An integer representing the current level of punishment. Starts at 0.
*   `punishment_duration`: An integer representing how many *more* rounds of punishment are to be enacted. Starts at 0.

**Decision Logic (for round `t > 1`):**

*   **If `punishment_duration > 0`:**
    *   **Action:** Play **D (Defect)**.
    *   **Update:** Decrement `punishment_duration` by 1.
*   **Else (not in a punishment phase):**
    *   **Calculate `group_cooperation_rate_prev`:** The average cooperation rate from round `t-1`.
    *   **Determine if collective cooperation is beneficial:**
        *   If *all* players cooperated in the previous round (`group_cooperation_rate_prev == 1`):
            *   **Action:** Play **C (Cooperate)**. (Reinforce successful cooperation)
        *   Else if `group_cooperation_rate_prev` is sufficiently high (e.g., greater than `k/n`):
            *   **Action:** Play **C (Cooperate)**. (The expected payoff from cooperation is positive or at least non-negative, encouraging continued cooperation). The threshold `k/n` is crucial: if the average contribution is less than `k/n`, then the expected payoff from *cooperating* is less than the payoff from *defecting* if others cooperate.
        *   Else if `group_cooperation_rate_prev` is low, and *I* defected in the previous round (`my_history[t-1] == 0`):
            *   **Action:** Play **D (Defect)**. (A simple tit-for-tat response to my own previous defection, in hopes of triggering a change if others are also defecting).
        *   Else if `group_cooperation_rate_prev` is low, and *I* cooperated in the previous round (`my_history[t-1] == 1`):
            *   **Action:** Play **D (Defect)**. (Trigger a punishment phase. This is where the strategy becomes more assertive in responding to group-level defection).
            *   **Initiate Punishment:** Set `punishment_level = max(1, n - number_of_cooperators_in_prev_round)`. This punishes proportionally to how many defected.
            *   **Set `punishment_duration = punishment_level`**. (Punish for a duration related to the severity of the group's defection).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (`t = 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Play **C (Cooperate)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the absence of any history, the default cooperative action is taken. This sets a positive tone and explores the possibility of mutual cooperation from the outset. It's a "leap of faith" for cooperation.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   **Action:** Play **D (Defect)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a standard Grim Trigger or End-Game Effect consideration. Since there are no future rounds to benefit from cooperation, the immediate incentive is to defect and keep the endowment. This is a pragmatic concession to the finite nature of the game.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The strategy's inherent cooperativeness lies in its **default to C**, its **willingness to forgive after punishment**, and its **threshold for continuing cooperation**.

*   **Default to C:** The strategy starts with cooperation and only deviates when a clear signal of widespread defection necessitates a response.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** The `punishment_duration` ensures that defection is not perpetual. Once a period of punishment is served, the strategy reverts to assessing the situation and may cooperate again if conditions improve. This allows for recovery from periods of low cooperation.
*   **Beneficial Cooperation Threshold:** The condition `group_cooperation_rate_prev > k/n` is a key cooperative element. It means the strategy will continue to cooperate as long as the *expected* return from cooperation (considering everyone's average action) is better than the guaranteed payoff from defecting individually. This is precisely where cooperation is mutually beneficial.
*   **Adaptive Punishment:** The `punishment_level` is dynamically adjusted based on the number of defectors in the previous round. This means the response is proportional to the perceived transgression, rather than a fixed punishment.

### Pseudocode:

```
// Initialize strategy parameters
my_history = [] // Stores player's past actions (1 for C, 0 for D)
punishment_level = 0
punishment_duration = 0

// Function to get total cooperators from past round (assuming access to opponent histories)
// This function would need to be provided or simulated based on tournament data.
// For now, let's assume we can track this.
function get_total_cooperators_prev_round(round_number, all_player_histories):
    if round_number == 0:
        return 0
    total_c = 0
    for player_index in range(n):
        // Assuming all_player_histories[player_index][round_number - 1] is their action
        if all_player_histories[player_index][round_number - 1] == 1:
            total_c += 1
    return total_c

// Main decision function for player i
function decide_action(current_round, all_player_histories):
    // Edge Case: Last Round
    if current_round == r:
        return D

    // Edge Case: First Round
    if current_round == 1:
        my_history.append(1) // Record action
        return C

    // Handle Punishment Phase
    if punishment_duration > 0:
        punishment_duration -= 1
        my_history.append(0) // Record action
        return D

    // Not in punishment phase, evaluate based on history
    total_cooperators_prev = get_total_cooperators_prev_round(current_round - 1, all_player_histories)
    group_cooperation_rate_prev = total_cooperators_prev / n

    my_last_action = my_history[-1] // Action from previous round

    // Strategy Logic:
    if group_cooperation_rate_prev == 1.0: // Everyone cooperated last round
        my_choice = C
    elif group_cooperation_rate_prev > (k / n): // Expected payoff of C is positive
        my_choice = C
    elif my_last_action == 0: // I defected last round, and group cooperation is low
        my_choice = D // Continue defecting as a reactive measure
    else: // I cooperated last round, but group cooperation is low
        // Trigger punishment
        my_choice = D
        punishment_level = max(1, n - total_cooperators_prev) // Punish proportionally
        punishment_duration = punishment_level

    my_history.append(my_choice) // Record action
    return my_choice
```

**Important Considerations for Implementation:**

*   **`get_total_cooperators_prev_round`:** This function is crucial. In a tournament setting, the AI would need access to the *observed actions of all other players* in the previous round to calculate the group cooperation rate. Without this, the strategy would be significantly handicapped. Assuming this information is available is key to its adaptive nature.
*   **Parameter Tuning:** The thresholds (e.g., `group_cooperation_rate_prev > k/n`) and the punishment duration calculation are parameters that could be tuned. The current design aims for a reasonable balance. The `punishment_level = max(1, n - total_cooperators_prev)` is a specific choice that makes the punishment severity proportional to the observed defection.

This ATFP strategy is designed to be robust by:
*   **Starting cooperatively:** Encouraging good behavior.
*   **Responding to group trends:** Adapting to the overall level of cooperation.
*   **Punishing defection:** Deterring free-riding.
*   **Forgiving:** Allowing for recovery and re-establishing cooperation.
*   **Leveraging parameters:** Using `k/n` as a baseline for beneficial cooperation.
*   **Acknowledging the endgame:** Defecting in the final round is a standard game-theoretic optimization.

Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness, as requested.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Conditional Punishment"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it, punishing defection, and giving second chances. It's designed to be adaptive to the collective behavior of the group while remaining cooperative at its core.

### Core Principle:

The strategy's default state is **cooperation**. It will only deviate from cooperation when there's a clear indication that collective defection is beneficial or that previous cooperation has been exploited.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to cooperate or defect in any given round is based on the observed behavior in the *previous* round and a threshold of group cooperation.

*   **Default Action:** Cooperate (C).
*   **Trigger for Defection:** If, in the previous round, the **proportion of players who defected is greater than or equal to a certain threshold**.
*   **Cooperation Threshold:** Let's define a threshold `T`. A reasonable starting point for `T` would be `k/n`. This threshold signifies that if the "social benefit" of defection (each defector gets 1, while cooperators get `k/n` less than they would if everyone cooperated) outweighs the individual benefit of cooperation, then we consider defecting. Specifically, if the average payoff for defecting in a round where `x` players cooperated is `1 + (k/n) * x`, and the average payoff for cooperating is `(k/n) * x`, then defecting is better if `1 + (k/n) * x > (k/n) * x`, which is always true. However, the *collective* outcome is worse. The threshold `T` represents the proportion of players whose defection is detrimental to the group's overall payoff.
    *   Let `D_prev` be the number of players who defected in the previous round.
    *   Let `N_prev` be the total number of players in the previous round (which is `n`).
    *   The **proportion of defectors** in the previous round is `D_prev / N_prev`.
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   If `D_prev / N_prev >= k/n`, then play **Defect (D)**.
        *   Otherwise, play **Cooperate (C)**.

*   **Explanation of Threshold `k/n`:**
    *   If `k/n` players defect, each defector gains `1` and cooperators gain `(k/n) * (n - k/n)`.
    *   If all `n` players cooperated, each player would gain `(k/n) * n = k`.
    *   If `k/n` players defected, the total payoff for the group is `(n - k/n) * (k/n) + (k/n) * 1`.
    *   The threshold `k/n` is chosen because if the proportion of defectors *reaches* `k/n`, then the collective payoff is likely to be worse than if everyone had cooperated. This is the point where the individual incentive to defect starts to dominate the collective good.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   In the very first round, there is no history. To embody the cooperative spirit, the strategy will **default to Cooperate (C)**. This is the most cooperative starting point.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   In the last round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. Rational players will likely defect to maximize their individual payoff in this final round. To avoid being exploited, the strategy will **default to Defect (D)** in the last round. This is a pragmatic adaptation to the game's terminal nature.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Default to Cooperation:** The strategy's inherent tendency is to cooperate. It only defects when there's a clear, quantifiable signal that such defection is a response to widespread defection and potential exploitation by others.
*   **Forgiveness (Implicit):** If the group's behavior shifts back towards cooperation (i.e., the proportion of defectors falls below `k/n`), the strategy will immediately revert to cooperating. This allows for the restoration of cooperative norms.
*   **Focus on Group Benefit:** The threshold `k/n` is directly tied to the game's parameters, reflecting a decision rule that considers the impact on the overall group welfare. A lower `k/n` implies a higher tolerance for defection before retaliation, while a higher `k/n` means the strategy is more sensitive to any deviation from full cooperation.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Conditional Punishment

// Parameters:
// n: total number of players
// r: total number of rounds
// k: multiplication factor

// Global variables (maintained across rounds):
// history_of_actions: a list of lists, where history_of_actions[t] contains the actions of all players in round t.
//                     Initialize as an empty list.

// Function: ChooseAction(current_round, my_player_index, other_players_actions_history)

// 1. Handle the first round
if current_round == 1:
    return C // Cooperate in the first round

// 2. Handle the last round
if current_round == r:
    return D // Defect in the last round

// 3. For intermediate rounds (2 to r-1):
// Calculate the proportion of defectors in the previous round
previous_round_actions = history_of_actions[current_round - 1]
number_of_defectors_prev_round = count(player_action == D for player_action in previous_round_actions)
proportion_defectors_prev_round = number_of_defectors_prev_round / n

// Define the cooperation threshold
cooperation_threshold = k / n

// Decision rule:
if proportion_defectors_prev_round >= cooperation_threshold:
    return D // Defect if the previous round had significant defection
else:
    return C // Cooperate otherwise

// End Function
```

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Robustness:** The strategy is robust because it doesn't rely on specific assumptions about other players' strategies. It reacts to observed behavior. The "punishment" is conditional and proportional to the observed defection rate, preventing a downward spiral of mutual punishment for minor transgressions.
*   **Adaptability:** It adapts to the group's emergent behavior. If the group consistently cooperates, this strategy will also consistently cooperate. If the group becomes highly uncooperative, this strategy will respond with defection, but will quickly switch back to cooperation if the group does.

This strategy offers a balance between maintaining a cooperative stance and protecting against exploitation, making it well-suited for a diverse tournament environment.

description_COOPERATIVE_100 = '''
Here's a design for a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptiveness and robustness within the given constraints.

## Strategy: Grim Trigger with a Tit-for-Tat Twist

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection severely, but with a mechanism to recover from lapses and re-establish cooperation. It's called "Grim Trigger with a Tit-for-Tat Twist" because it borrows the core idea of perpetual punishment for defection from Grim Trigger, but adds a nuance to allow for reconciliation if the group largely returns to cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core decision rule for player *i* in round *t* is as follows:

*   **If all players cooperated in the previous round (t-1):** Cooperate (C) in round *t*.
*   **If at least one player defected in the previous round (t-1):**
    *   **Check for a "Reciprocity Threshold":** If the number of cooperators in the previous round (t-1) was greater than or equal to `n * (k/n)`, which simplifies to the number of cooperators being at least `k`, then defect (D) in round *t*. This is the "Grim Trigger" element – any defection leads to punishment.
    *   **Check for a "Reconciliation Window":** If the number of cooperators in the previous round (t-1) was *less than k*, but *more than 0*, then the strategy enters a "Reconciliation Window." In this window, player *i* will **cooperate (C)** in round *t*. This is the "Tit-for-Tat Twist" – it allows a chance for the group to bounce back if the defection wasn't unanimous and a significant portion still tried to cooperate.
    *   **If no players cooperated in the previous round (t-1):** Defect (D) in round *t*. (This is covered by the first part of the "If at least one player defected" condition, but explicitly stated for clarity).

**In simpler terms:**

*   **Cooperate if everyone else did.**
*   **If someone defected:**
    *   **If enough people still cooperated (at least 'k'):** Punish them by defecting.
    *   **If only a few people defected (less than 'k' but more than zero):** Give them a chance to re-cooperate by cooperating yourself.
    *   **If no one cooperated:** Keep defecting.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Initial Action:** Cooperate (C).
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative and optimistic starting point is to contribute. This sets a positive tone and gives an opportunity for others to reciprocate.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Final Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. The best individual outcome is to defect and secure the private endowment (payoff of 1), as there are no subsequent rounds where this defection would be punished. This is a rational choice for the last round of a repeated game with a known end.

*   **During the game (1 < t < r):** The decision rules outlined in section 1 apply.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative because:

*   **It prioritizes cooperation:** The default action is to cooperate, and it only deviates to defect in response to observed defection.
*   **It rewards cooperation:** When all players cooperate, it reinforces that behavior by continuing to cooperate.
*   **It attempts to recover cooperation:** The "Reconciliation Window" is designed to prevent a spiral into perpetual defection if a lapse in cooperation was not overwhelming. It allows for the possibility of rebuilding a cooperative norm.
*   **It is aligned with the cooperative mindset:** It aims to achieve the highest *collective* payoff by fostering a state where everyone cooperates. While it has a punitive element, this is a means to an end: restoring a cooperative equilibrium.

### Pseudocode

```pseudocode
// Global Variables
n: integer // number of players
r: integer // number of rounds
k: float // multiplication factor
current_round = 1
cooperators_in_previous_round = 0
total_players = n

function decide_action():
  // Handle Last Round
  if current_round == r:
    return D

  // Handle First Round
  if current_round == 1:
    return C

  // Handle Subsequent Rounds (1 < t < r)
  if cooperators_in_previous_round == total_players:
    // All cooperated last round, so continue cooperating
    return C
  else:
    // At least one player defected last round
    if cooperators_in_previous_round >= k:
      // Significant cooperation maintained (>= k), so punish defection
      return D
    else if cooperators_in_previous_round > 0 and cooperators_in_previous_round < k:
      // Partial defection (less than k cooperators but more than zero), enter reconciliation
      return C
    else: // cooperators_in_previous_round == 0
      // No one cooperated last round, continue defecting
      return D

function update_state(actions_in_previous_round):
  // actions_in_previous_round is a list or array of actions ('C' or 'D') from the previous round
  cooperators_in_previous_round = count_cooperators(actions_in_previous_round)
  current_round = current_round + 1

function count_cooperators(actions):
  count = 0
  for action in actions:
    if action == C:
      count = count + 1
  return count

// --- Game Loop Example ---
// Initialize:
// n, r, k are set
// current_round = 1
// cooperators_in_previous_round = 0

// For each round t from 1 to r:
//   My_Action = decide_action()
//   // Submit My_Action to the game
//   // Receive actions of all other players from round t
//   // Let's say actions_this_round = [...]
//   update_state(actions_this_round)
```

**Explanation of the `k` threshold:** The parameter `k` is crucial. If `k` is small (close to 1), the "Reconciliation Window" will be very wide, meaning even with significant defection, the strategy will try to cooperate. If `k` is large (close to `n`), the "Reconciliation Window" will be very narrow, and the strategy will be more inclined to punish any defection. This adaptiveness to the game parameter `k` is a key feature.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_101 = '''
This strategy, which we'll call **"Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness" (CCF)**, aims to maximize long-term cooperation by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection, but also allowing for a return to cooperation after a period of sustained defection. It's designed to be adaptive and robust by learning from the history of play.

## Cooperative Strategy: Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness (CCF)

The core principle of CCF is to start cooperatively and continue cooperating as long as the collective behavior of the group is largely cooperative. If the group starts to defect, CCF will also defect to protect its accumulated payoff. However, it will remain open to returning to cooperation if the group shows signs of sustained cooperation again.

### 1. Decision Rules

CCF's decision in round `t` depends on the observed level of cooperation in previous rounds. We will use a **cooperation threshold** to guide our decisions.

*   **Cooperate (C) if:** The proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round (`t-1`) is **greater than or equal to** a defined `cooperation_threshold`.
*   **Defect (D) if:** The proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round (`t-1`) is **less than** the `cooperation_threshold`.

**Defining the `cooperation_threshold`:**

The `cooperation_threshold` is a crucial parameter that influences the strategy's tendency to cooperate. A higher threshold means we require more cooperation from others to continue cooperating. A lower threshold makes us more forgiving.

For this strategy, we'll set a `cooperation_threshold` that is slightly above the "tragedy of the commons" point. The critical point where cooperation becomes individually beneficial is when `k/n > 1/2` (or `k > n/2`). Since our `k < n`, it's never unilaterally profitable for an individual to cooperate if others defect. However, collective cooperation leads to the highest *group* payoff.

A reasonable `cooperation_threshold` should reflect a belief that *most* players are attempting to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's set:

`cooperation_threshold = 0.5` (or 50%)

This means we will continue to cooperate as long as at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.

**Adaptability Component: Forgiveness**

To be more forgiving and robust, CCF incorporates a mechanism to return to cooperation even if defection occurred. Instead of immediately defecting forever after one instance of low cooperation, CCF will track consecutive rounds of defection.

*   **Defection Counter:** We maintain a `consecutive_defects` counter, initialized to 0.
*   **Increment Counter:** If the observed proportion of cooperators in round `t-1` falls below `cooperation_threshold`, we increment `consecutive_defects`.
*   **Reset Counter:** If the observed proportion of cooperators in round `t-1` is `cooperation_threshold` or higher, we reset `consecutive_defects` to 0.
*   **Trigger for Forgiveness:** CCF will only switch to defecting if `consecutive_defects` exceeds a certain `forgiveness_period`. If `consecutive_defects` is less than or equal to `forgiveness_period`, CCF will still cooperate, hoping to steer the group back towards cooperation.

Let's set `forgiveness_period = 2`. This means CCF will tolerate two rounds of below-threshold cooperation before it starts defecting itself.

**Refined Decision Rule:**

*   **Cooperate (C) if:** (Proportion of cooperators in round `t-1` ≥ `cooperation_threshold`) OR (`consecutive_defects` ≤ `forgiveness_period`).
*   **Defect (D) if:** (Proportion of cooperators in round `t-1` < `cooperation_threshold`) AND (`consecutive_defects` > `forgiveness_period`).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   In the absence of any history, CCF defaults to its cooperative nature.
    *   **Decision:** Cooperate (C).
    *   Initialize `consecutive_defects = 0`.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   In a standard repeated game with a known end, the last round often devolves into a one-shot game where defection is the Nash Equilibrium. However, since CCF is designed to be cooperative and adaptive, it will continue to apply its rules.
    *   **Decision:** Apply the standard decision rule based on the history of round `r-1`. The "end" of the game doesn't inherently change the calculation for the last round. CCF doesn't have a special "punishment phase" that extends beyond the game's end.

*   **No History (e.g., for parameter estimation):**
    *   If for some reason, no history is available (though the problem statement implies perfect information and common knowledge, so this is unlikely), default to Cooperate (C).

### 3. Being Cooperative

The strategy is inherently cooperative in its design:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** It begins by cooperating, signaling a desire for mutual benefit.
*   **Threshold-Based Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the group exhibits a sufficient level of cooperation, indicating a shared interest in the public good.
*   **Forgiveness:** The `forgiveness_period` allows the strategy to be resilient and not immediately abandon cooperation upon seeing a slight dip in collective behavior. This promotes long-term cooperative norms and discourages retaliatory cycles.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** By observing the group's behavior and adjusting its own action, CCF learns and adapts to the prevailing dynamics of the game.

### Pseudocode for CCF Strategy

// Game Parameters (provided)

    // Get actions from the previous round
    if previous_round not in game_history:
        // This should not happen with perfect information, but as a fallback

    // Update consecutive_defects counter
    if proportion_cooperators_previous_round < cooperation_threshold:
        consecutive_defects = consecutive_defects + 1
    else:
        consecutive_defects = 0

    // Make decision based on updated counter and threshold
    if proportion_cooperators_previous_round >= cooperation_threshold or consecutive_defects <= forgiveness_period:
        return 'C' // Cooperate
    else:
        return 'D' // Defect

// --- Tournament Implementation Note ---
// The strategy needs access to the 'game_history' which should be a shared data structure
// managed by the tournament organizer. This history should contain the actions of all players
// for all previous rounds.

// Example of how game_history might be structured and updated:
// game_history = {
//    1: ['C', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'C'], // Actions in round 1
//    2: ['C', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'C']  // Actions in round 2
// }
// After each round, the actions of all players for that round are appended to game_history.
```

This strategy aims for a balance between promoting cooperation and protecting itself from exploitation. Its adaptability comes from its reliance on observable history rather than fixed patterns, making it robust to a variety of opponents.

description_COOPERATIVE_102 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but it incorporates a mechanism to return to cooperation if the overall group behavior shifts back towards it.

### Core Principle:

**"Cooperate if the group is cooperating; defect if the group is defecting. Be forgiving if a defection is an isolated incident, but persistent if defection becomes the norm."**

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` for player `i` depends on the observed behavior of the group in the previous round `t-1`.

*   **Initial State (First Round):** In the very first round, we have no history. To signal a cooperative intent and to test the waters for cooperation, the strategy will **Cooperate (C)**.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Calculate Group Cooperation Level:** Observe the number of players who cooperated in the previous round (`t-1`). Let `N_C(t-1)` be this number.
    *   **Decision Threshold:** We will define a "cooperation threshold" that represents a minimal level of group cooperation we are willing to maintain. A reasonable threshold would be to require a majority of players to cooperate. Let's call this `min_cooperators`. A good starting point for `min_cooperators` would be `floor(n/2) + 1` (i.e., strict majority) or simply `floor(n/2)` if we want to be slightly more lenient. For robustness, let's use `floor(n/2)`.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `N_C(t-1) >= min_cooperators`:** The group demonstrated sufficient cooperation in the previous round. Therefore, **Cooperate (C)** in round `t`. This rewards past cooperation.
        *   **If `N_C(t-1) < min_cooperators`:** The group did not cooperate enough. This signals a potential shift towards defection.
            *   **Check for Isolated Defection:** We need to distinguish between a widespread defection and isolated defections. We can introduce a "forgiveness counter" or a "defection tolerance." Let's use a `defection_tolerance`. If the number of defectors in the previous round was small (e.g., `n - N_C(t-1) <= 1`), it might be an isolated mistake. In this case, **Cooperate (C)** to encourage them back.
            *   **Persistent Defection:** If the number of defectors was significant (`n - N_C(t-1) > 1`), and the group cooperation level was below the threshold, it indicates a persistent trend of defection. In this case, **Defect (D)** in round `t`. This punishes persistent defection and protects our own endowment.

**Summary of Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1:** Cooperate (C).
2.  **Round `t > 1`:**
    *   Let `N_C(t-1)` be the number of cooperators in round `t-1`.
    *   Let `min_cooperators = floor(n/2)`.
    *   Let `defection_tolerance = 1` (meaning, if only 1 player defected, we still try to cooperate).

    *   **If `N_C(t-1) >= min_cooperators`:** Cooperate (C).
    *   **Else if `(n - N_C(t-1)) <= defection_tolerance`:** Cooperate (C). (Forgive isolated defections)
    *   **Else:** Defect (D). (Punish persistent widespread defection)

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** As stated above, the strategy always starts by **Cooperating (C)**. This sets a cooperative tone and allows the group to establish a cooperative baseline if others are inclined.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** The strategy inherently handles the last round. The decision logic remains the same. In the last round, there's no future interaction to consider for reciprocal behavior. However, our strategy doesn't explicitly change its behavior based on being the last round. It will still cooperate if the group exhibited sufficient cooperation in `r-1`, defect if there was widespread, persistent defection in `r-1`, and forgive isolated defections in `r-1`. This means it continues to play "optimally" based on the history, even if it's the final round.

*   **Parameter `k`:** The strategy doesn't directly use `k` in its decision-making logic. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is implicitly tied to `k`.
    *   If `k` is close to `n`, cooperation is highly incentivized (as seen in example calculation 2 where all cooperate yields a high payoff). In such scenarios, this strategy is likely to succeed in establishing and maintaining cooperation.
    *   If `k` is closer to 1, the payoff for defecting when others cooperate becomes more appealing. This strategy might then have to resort to defection more often.

*   **Parameter `n`:** The number of players directly influences the `min_cooperators` threshold. A larger `n` makes achieving a majority cooperation harder, potentially leading to more defections if the group isn't strongly inclined to cooperate.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative because its primary driver is to *reward and maintain* group cooperation.

*   **Default to Cooperation:** It starts by cooperating and continues to cooperate as long as the group is collectively demonstrating a sufficient level of cooperation.
*   **Punishment is Conditional:** Defection is only a response to the group's deviation from cooperative norms, not an aggressive starting tactic. It's a defensive measure against being exploited.
*   **Forgiveness:** The inclusion of `defection_tolerance` shows a willingness to return to cooperation even after minor lapses from others, acknowledging that mistakes can happen.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(player_id, current_round, game_history, parameters):
    n = parameters['n']
    r = parameters['r']
    k = parameters['k'] # k is not directly used in decision but is part of game context

    min_cooperators = floor(n / 2)
    defection_tolerance = 1

    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Always cooperate in the first round

    # Get history from the previous round (current_round - 1)
    previous_round_actions = game_history.get(current_round - 1, {}) # Dictionary of player_id: action
    num_cooperators_prev_round = sum(1 for action in previous_round_actions.values() if action == 'C')
    num_defectors_prev_round = n - num_cooperators_prev_round

    if num_cooperators_prev_round >= min_cooperators:
        return 'C'  # Sufficient cooperation in the previous round, continue cooperating
    elif num_defectors_prev_round <= defection_tolerance:
        return 'C'  # Isolated defection, forgive and attempt to return to cooperation
    else:
        return 'D'  # Persistent widespread defection, defect to protect own endowment
```

This strategy is designed to be a stable cooperative focal point. It encourages others to cooperate by making cooperation the default and rewarding it. It only resorts to defection when faced with sustained group-level defection, making it robust to exploitation while still valuing collective well-being.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_103 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, aiming for robustness and adaptability in a tournament setting.

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Threshold Cooperation (AT4T-TC)

This strategy combines the proven effectiveness of Tit-for-Tat in pairwise interactions with a mechanism to adapt to collective cooperation levels and ensure long-term gains through conditional cooperation. It aims to be cooperative by default but not naive, and to punish defection while rewarding sustained cooperation.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of AT4T-TC is a conditional cooperation approach. The decision in any given round (after the first) depends on two primary factors: the *overall cooperation level* in the previous round and the player's *own past actions*.

**Decision Logic (Round t > 1):**

*   **Cooperate (C):** I will play **C** in round *t* if:
    *   The **proportion of cooperators in round (t-1)** was **greater than or equal to a predefined "Cooperation Threshold" (CT)**.
    *   OR, if I played **C in round (t-1)** and the **proportion of cooperators in round (t-1)** was **at least a "Minimum Viable Cooperation" (MVC) level** (which is lower than CT, to avoid immediate collapse).

*   **Defect (D):** I will play **D** in round *t* if:
    *   The **proportion of cooperators in round (t-1)** was **less than the "Minimum Viable Cooperation" (MVC)**.
    *   OR, if I played **C in round (t-1)** but the **proportion of cooperators in round (t-1)** fell below **MVC**.
    *   OR, if I played **D in round (t-1)** and the **proportion of cooperators in round (t-1)** was **less than the "Cooperation Threshold" (CT)**.

**Rationale:**

*   **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** This represents a desired level of collective participation needed to sustain profitable cooperation. If the group is cooperating at or above this level, it's beneficial to continue contributing.
*   **Minimum Viable Cooperation (MVC):** This is a safety net. It's the minimum level of cooperation required to prevent individual payoffs from dropping below what might be achieved by unilateral defection *if everyone else were also defecting*. It also provides a slight buffer to avoid immediate collapse if a few players start defecting.
*   **Tit-for-Tat Element:** If I cooperated in the previous round and the group maintained a reasonable level of cooperation (even if below CT but above MVC), I'll continue to cooperate. This rewards past cooperative behavior.
*   **Punishment/Retaliation:** If the group's cooperation drops significantly below MVC, I will defect to protect my own endowment. If I was cooperating and the group's cooperation drops below CT but not below MVC, I'll defect for one round to signal dissatisfaction but might return to cooperation if the group recovers to MVC in the next round.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**First Round (t = 1):**

*   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
*   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative and potentially beneficial action is to initiate cooperation. This sets a positive tone and allows the strategy to learn from the group's response. It aligns with the strategy's cooperative objective.

**Last Round (t = r):**

*   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
*   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. A player who cooperates in the last round can be exploited by defectors who will receive a higher payoff without future consequences. This is a standard backward induction outcome for finite repeated games with a known end. Defecting in the last round maximizes individual payoff in that round.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative

**Core Cooperative Principle:**
AT4T-TC is fundamentally designed to be cooperative. Its default action is to cooperate. It only defects to:

1.  **Protect itself from exploitation** when the collective cooperation level falls to unsustainable lows.
2.  **Signal dissatisfaction** and potentially encourage a return to cooperation when the group's behavior deviates from the desired cooperation threshold.
3.  **Maximize its own final payoff** in the final round, where the incentive for group cooperation disappears.

**Adaptability:**

The strategy is adaptive because its decisions are dynamically linked to the observed behavior of other players. It doesn't rely on fixed beliefs about opponents but rather reacts to their actions. If the group consistently cooperates, AT4T-TC will continue to cooperate. If the group consistently defects, AT4T-TC will also defect (after an initial period of trying to foster cooperation).

**Robustness:**

The inclusion of both a "Cooperation Threshold" (CT) and a "Minimum Viable Cooperation" (MVC) makes the strategy robust.

*   **CT** ensures that cooperation is only sustained when it's demonstrably beneficial for the group.
*   **MVC** prevents immediate collapse due to minor fluctuations in cooperation, allowing for some resilience.
*   The strategy doesn't punish minor deviations from CT too harshly, allowing for recovery.

---

### Parameter Selection (for implementation, to be tuned before the tournament):

*   **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** A value between `(k/n)` and `1`. A good starting point might be slightly above the point where individual payoff from cooperation equals individual payoff from defection if everyone else cooperates, or a significant portion of players. For `n=6, k=2`, if 3 cooperate, player C gets 1, player D gets 2. If 4 cooperate, player C gets `0 + (2/6)*4 = 1.33`, player D gets `1 + (2/6)*4 = 2.33`. If 5 cooperate, player C gets `0 + (2/6)*5 = 1.67`, player D gets `1 + (2/6)*5 = 2.67`. If 6 cooperate, player C gets `0 + (2/6)*6 = 2`, player D gets `1 + (2/6)*6 = 3`. So, cooperation is individually rational when roughly `(k/n) * N_cooperators > 1`. For `n=6, k=2`, `2/6 * N_cooperators > 1` means `N_cooperators > 3`. So, if more than 3 players cooperate, it's beneficial. Let's set `CT` to a level that encourages this, e.g., **0.6 (60%)** of players cooperating.
*   **Minimum Viable Cooperation (MVC):** A value lower than CT, but high enough to prevent immediate collapse. It should be at least the level where a cooperator doesn't get *strictly worse* than a defector if *most* players defect. For `n=6, k=2`, if only 1 cooperates, C gets `0 + 2/6 * 1 = 0.33`, D gets `1 + 2/6 * 1 = 1.33`. If 2 cooperate, C gets `0 + 2/6 * 2 = 0.67`, D gets `1 + 2/6 * 2 = 1.67`. If 3 cooperate, C gets 1, D gets 2. So, a player is better off cooperating if at least 3 players cooperate. To avoid immediate collapse, MVC should be just above the point where cooperation is catastrophically bad. A value of **0.3 (30%)** might be a reasonable starting point.

**Example Parameter Tuning (n=6, k=2):**

*   `CT = 0.6` (meaning if ≥ 60% of players, i.e., ≥ 3.6, so 4 players, cooperate, I will cooperate).
*   `MVC = 0.3` (meaning if ≥ 30% of players, i.e., ≥ 1.8, so 2 players, cooperate, I have a buffer).

      // Let's refine: If I defected, and group is only just above MVC, I'll continue defecting to see if they rise.
      // If I defected, and group is approaching CT, maybe I'd consider cooperating.

  // This is implicitly handled by `my_last_action = C/D` within the if/elif/else blocks.
  // However, it's crucial that this variable is correctly updated *after* a decision is made for the *next* round's logic.

  // The `my_last_action` variable should store the action taken *in the current round*.
  // So, if `DecideAction` returns `C`, `my_last_action` for the *next* round should be `C`.

```

**Refinement on `my_last_action` in Pseudocode:**

The `my_last_action` in the pseudocode should ideally represent *my action in the round just completed*, which influences the decision for the *current round*. Let's adjust the pseudocode for clarity on this.

Here's a design for a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptiveness and robustness:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Tit-for-Tat with Punishment and Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it, punishing defection, and offering opportunities for redemption. It's designed to be robust to a variety of player behaviors, including those who might exploit or be initially hesitant to cooperate.

### 1. Decision Rules

Our strategy's core principle is to **reciprocate the behavior of the group**, but with an added layer of "punishment" for widespread defection and "forgiveness" to re-establish cooperation.

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   In the previous round, the **majority** of players cooperated.
    *   OR, if this is the **first round** (handled in edge cases).
    *   OR, if we were in a "Punishment Phase" and the number of cooperators in the *previous* round has reached a certain threshold (indicating a willingness to return to cooperation).

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   In the previous round, the **majority** of players defected.
    *   OR, if we are currently in a "Punishment Phase" and the number of cooperators in the *previous* round has not met the forgiveness threshold.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action: Cooperate (C)**
    *   **Rationale:** The first round is crucial for establishing an initial signal of cooperativeness. A cooperative start encourages others to follow suit. Since there's no history, a safe and pro-social default is to cooperate.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of future interactions, the incentive to cooperate diminishes. There's no future payoff to gain from cooperation, and defecting maximizes immediate individual gain. This is a standard rational response in the finite horizon version of such games.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its *intent* and *default behavior*.

*   **Pro-Cooperative Default:** The strategy starts by cooperating and continues to cooperate as long as the group's behavior suggests cooperation is reciprocated.
*   **Adaptive Punishment:** Defection is not met with immediate, permanent retaliation. Instead, the strategy enters a "Punishment Phase" where it defects for a limited period to signal that defection is costly. The duration and intensity of this punishment can be further refined.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** The strategy actively seeks to return to cooperation. The "Punishment Phase" is exited when a sufficient number of players demonstrate a willingness to cooperate again. This prevents the game from devolving into perpetual defection due to a single bad round.

// State Variables
current_round = 1

// Strategy Function for Player i

    r = game_params.r
    k = game_params.k

        return D // Defect in the last round

    // --- Handle First Round ---
    if current_round == 1:
        // Initial state, assume cooperation is best to signal
        current_round = current_round + 1
        return C

    // --- Handle Punishment Phase ---
    if punishment_phase:
        if punishment_rounds_remaining > 0:
            punishment_rounds_remaining = punishment_rounds_remaining - 1
            // Check if forgiveness conditions are met
            if total_cooperators_last_round >= punishment_threshold:
                punishment_phase = false
                punishment_rounds_remaining = 0
                // After exiting punishment, re-evaluate based on current round's outcome
                // (This could be a slight deviation, for simplicity we assume returning to default C if not enough defected)
                if total_cooperators_last_round >= ceil(n * 0.6): // Example: need a strong signal to resume C
                    return C
                else:
                    return D // Still not enough cooperation, continue defecting cautiously
            else:
                return D // Continue punishment
        else: // Punishment phase was active but ended, now re-evaluate
            punishment_phase = false
            // Re-evaluate based on the round that just ended the punishment
            if total_cooperators_last_round >= ceil(n * 0.6): // Example: need a strong signal to resume C
                return C
            else:
                return D


    // --- Normal Round Decision ---
    // Calculate majority cooperation in the previous round
    majority_cooperated = (total_cooperators_last_round >= ceil(n / 2.0))

    if majority_cooperated:
        return C // Cooperate if majority cooperated last round
    else:
        // Majority defected, initiate punishment phase
        punishment_phase = true
        punishment_rounds_remaining = 2 // Example: Punish for 2 rounds
        return D

// Function to update state after a round
function update_state(player_actions, round_number):
    current_round = round_number + 1
    total_cooperators = count_cooperators(player_actions)
    total_cooperators_last_round = total_cooperators

    // If punishment phase was active, check if we should exit
    if punishment_phase and punishment_rounds_remaining > 0:
        if total_cooperators >= punishment_threshold:
            punishment_phase = false
            punishment_rounds_remaining = 0
```

### Strategy Details and Robustness Considerations:

*   **Majority Rule:** Using the majority of players' actions as the primary signal for cooperation is robust. It prevents a single defector from triggering a cascade of punishment and is less susceptible to isolated noise or errors.
*   **Adaptive Punishment Duration:** The `punishment_rounds_remaining` could be a parameter that is itself adaptive. For example, if after the initial punishment period, cooperation doesn't resume, the punishment could be extended. However, for simplicity and to maintain a focus on forgiveness, a fixed short duration is a good starting point.
*   **Forgiveness Threshold:** The `punishment_threshold` for exiting the punishment phase is crucial. It should be high enough to signal that continued defection is not tolerated but low enough to allow for forgiveness if a substantial portion of players are willing to cooperate again. `ceil(n * 0.5)` is a reasonable starting point.
*   **No Pre-commitment:** The strategy doesn't pre-commit to a fixed number of defections or a specific cooperation schedule. It reacts to the observed behavior of the group.
*   **Robustness to Exploitation:** If players attempt to exploit the cooperative nature by defecting while others cooperate, the strategy will quickly detect this (as the majority will likely shift towards defection) and initiate a punishment phase.
*   **Robustness to Mistrust:** If players are initially mistrustful and defect, the strategy's initial cooperation aims to break this cycle by providing a positive example. If this fails, it will adapt.

This strategy balances the desire for cooperation with the necessity of self-preservation in a repeated game with potentially uncooperative players. Its adaptiveness lies in its reaction to observed group behavior, and its robustness comes from its majority-based decision-making and its built-in forgiveness mechanism.

description_COOPERATIVE_105 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust, focusing on maximizing collective and individual long-term payoffs by encouraging cooperation.

## Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

This strategy is inspired by the success of Tit-for-Tat in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, but adapted for the N-player context and with mechanisms to encourage broader cooperation. The core idea is to start cooperatively and then mirror the *average* behavior of others.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in the current round depends on the players' actions in the *previous* round.

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round, the strategy will always Cooperate. This signals a willingness to engage in the public good and allows for the potential of high collective payoffs early on.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Calculate the average cooperation rate in the previous round (t-1).** Let `AvgCoopRate_(t-1)` be the proportion of players (including oneself, if applicable for analysis) who played 'C' in round `t-1`.
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   If `AvgCoopRate_(t-1)` is **above a certain threshold (CoopThreshold)**, then play **C** (Cooperate).
        *   If `AvgCoopRate_(t-1)` is **at or below the CoopThreshold**, then play **D** (Defect).

**Rationale for the Threshold:** The `CoopThreshold` is crucial for adaptiveness.
    *   A low threshold means the strategy is forgiving and will continue cooperating even if cooperation drops slightly. This can help prevent a downward spiral of defection.
    *   A high threshold means the strategy is more sensitive to declining cooperation and will defect more readily if the group is not sustaining a high level of cooperative play.

**Proposed `CoopThreshold`:** For this strategy, we will set `CoopThreshold` to **`k / n`**.

**Rationale for `CoopThreshold = k/n`:**
    *   Recall the payoff formula: `π_i = (1 - c_i) + (k/n) × Σ(j=1 to n) c_j`.
    *   If a player defects (`c_i = 0`), their payoff is `1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators`.
    *   If a player cooperates (`c_i = 1`), their payoff is `(k/n) * total_cooperators`.
    *   Consider the "break-even" point for a single player *if everyone else cooperates*. If all `n-1` others cooperate, and player `i` also cooperates, the total cooperators are `n`. Player `i`'s payoff is `(k/n) * n = k`. If player `i` defects while others cooperate, their payoff is `1 + (k/n) * (n-1) = 1 + k - k/n`.
    *   More importantly, consider the *marginal benefit* of cooperation for an individual. If player `i` cooperates, their payoff changes by `(k/n)`. If they defect, they gain 1 unit privately but lose `(k/n)` from the public good.
    *   The value `k/n` represents the *individual return* from one unit of contribution to the public good. If the average cooperation rate is *above* `k/n`, it means that on average, for every unit contributed by someone, the collective benefit shared among all `n` players is at least `k/n` per player. This suggests that on average, cooperation is individually beneficial or at least not significantly detrimental when the group is cooperative.
    *   If the average cooperation rate falls to or below `k/n`, it indicates that the collective benefit from cooperation is not sufficiently high to offset the private incentive to defect, and the strategy will switch to defection to protect its own interests and signal disapproval of low cooperation levels.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (t=1):** Always **Cooperate (C)**. This is a critical initialization to encourage cooperation and explore the potential for high joint payoffs.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the standard N-Player Public Goods Game, there is no "last round effect" that typically leads to backward induction for defection in finitely repeated games, *because the game is simultaneous-move*. Players do not know what others will do in the *last* round based on anticipation of a final outcome. Therefore, the strategy remains consistent: **use the same decision rule as in any other round (based on the average cooperation rate of the previous round).** If the game were known to be finite with a known end, a different strategy might be employed. However, given the specification, the ATFT rule applies to all rounds after the first.

*   **Initial Opponent Behavior (No History):** The strategy starts by cooperating, which is its primary mechanism for handling the unknown initial behavior of opponents.

*   **All Players Defecting:** If all players defect in round `t-1`, `AvgCoopRate_(t-1)` will be 0. Since `k/n` is always positive (1 < k < n), `0 <= k/n`, so the strategy will play **D** in round `t`. This is a necessary response to ensure the strategy doesn't continue to be exploited if everyone else defects.

*   **All Players Cooperating:** If all players cooperate in round `t-1`, `AvgCoopRate_(t-1)` will be 1. Since `k/n < 1`, `1 > k/n`, so the strategy will play **C** in round `t`. This reinforces successful cooperation.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The core of this strategy is its commitment to initiating cooperation and its responsiveness to sustained cooperative behavior from the group.

*   **Pro-Cooperative Initialization:** Starting with 'C' in round 1 is a strong signal of intent to build a cooperative environment, which is essential for achieving the highest possible payoffs in a public goods game.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** The strategy cooperates as long as the group's average cooperation rate remains above the individual incentive threshold (`k/n`). This is a form of "generous" or "forgiving" cooperation, as it doesn't immediately punish minor dips in cooperation, but rather requires a sustained decline to trigger defection.
*   **Restorative Potential:** By returning to cooperation when the group re-establishes a cooperative norm (i.e., `AvgCoopRate` rises back above `k/n`), the strategy allows for the recovery of cooperative play and the associated high payoffs.
*   **Focus on Collective Good:** While protecting its own payoff is a necessary component, the primary mechanism (cooperating when the group is cooperative) is geared towards achieving the highest collective payoffs, which indirectly benefits all players who are part of that cooperative effort.

        # Handle cases where some players might not have a recorded action (e.g., new players in future rounds, though not per spec)
        # For this spec, we assume all n players always have an action.

             # Should not happen in this game, but as a safety check
             return 'C' # Default to cooperation if no data

        avg_coop_rate_prev_round = total_cooperators_in_prev_round / total_players_in_prev_round

        # Decision based on threshold
        if avg_coop_rate_prev_round > coop_threshold:
            return 'C'  # Cooperate if average cooperation is sufficiently high
        else:
            return 'D'  # Defect if average cooperation is low or equal to threshold

Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness:

## Strategy: "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with a Trust Threshold"

This strategy aims to be cooperative by default, rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, but with a mechanism to tolerate minor deviations and encourage a return to cooperation.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Cooperate by Default:** Assume others want to cooperate and start by doing so.
*   **Reciprocity:** Mirror the behavior of others. If they cooperate, you cooperate. If they defect, you defect (to some extent).
*   **Forgiveness:** Don't hold grudges indefinitely. Allow for a return to cooperation.
*   **Trust Threshold:** Implement a dynamic "trust" level that influences how quickly you revert to cooperation after detecting defection.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of this strategy is based on observing the **average cooperation rate** of all players in the previous round.

*   **If average cooperation rate in round (t-1) is high:** Cooperate in round t.
*   **If average cooperation rate in round (t-1) is low:** Defect in round t.
*   **If average cooperation rate in round (t-1) is moderate:** Employ a more nuanced decision based on a "trust threshold."

Let's define "high," "low," and "moderate" more precisely. We'll use a dynamic threshold that adjusts based on past behavior.

**Variables:**

*   `trust_level`: A float between 0 and 1, representing the perceived willingness of others to cooperate. Initially set to 1.0 (full trust).
*   `cooperation_threshold`: A dynamic threshold for average cooperation rate.
*   `defection_punishment_factor`: A factor determining how long to defect after observing defection.

**Decision Logic for Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

1.  **Calculate Average Cooperation Rate (`avg_coop_t_minus_1`):**
    *   Sum the number of players who played 'C' in round `t-1`.
    *   Divide by `n` (total number of players).

2.  **Update `trust_level`:**
    *   If `avg_coop_t_minus_1` is close to 1.0, increase `trust_level` slightly (e.g., `trust_level = min(1.0, trust_level + 0.05)`).
    *   If `avg_coop_t_minus_1` is close to 0.0, decrease `trust_level` significantly (e.g., `trust_level = max(0.0, trust_level - 0.1)`).
    *   If `avg_coop_t_minus_1` is in between, adjust `trust_level` more gradually.

3.  **Determine `cooperation_threshold`:**
    *   This threshold will be a function of `trust_level`. A simple approach: `cooperation_threshold = trust_level`.

4.  **Make Decision for Round `t`:**
    *   **If `avg_coop_t_minus_1 >= cooperation_threshold`:** Play 'C'.
    *   **Else (if `avg_coop_t_minus_1 < cooperation_threshold`):** Play 'D'.

**Refinement for the "Moderate" Case (when `avg_coop` is not clearly high or low):**

Instead of a simple threshold, we can introduce a "forgiveness" mechanism.

*   **If `avg_coop_t_minus_1` is above a baseline cooperation level (e.g., 0.5):** Cooperate.
*   **If `avg_coop_t_minus_1` is below a certain defection level (e.g., 0.2):** Defect.
*   **If `avg_coop_t_minus_1` is in the middle range:**
    *   If the current `trust_level` is high, lean towards cooperation.
    *   If the current `trust_level` is low, lean towards defection.

Let's simplify this further with a more direct adaptation:

**Revised Decision Logic for Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

1.  **Calculate `avg_coop_t_minus_1`** (as before).
2.  **Calculate `num_defectors_t_minus_1`:** The number of players who played 'D' in round `t-1`.
3.  **Update `trust_level`:**
    *   If `num_defectors_t_minus_1 == 0`: `trust_level = min(1.0, trust_level + 0.1)` (strong reward for full cooperation).
    *   If `num_defectors_t_minus_1 > 0`: `trust_level = max(0.0, trust_level - (num_defectors_t_minus_1 / n) * 0.2)` (punishment proportional to defection, with a cap).

4.  **Set `defection_punishment_duration`:** This variable will track how many consecutive rounds we have defected.
    *   If we decided to defect in round `t-1`, increment `defection_punishment_duration`.
    *   If we decided to cooperate in round `t-1`, reset `defection_punishment_duration` to 0.

5.  **Make Decision for Round `t`:**

    *   **If `defection_punishment_duration > 0`:**
        *   Play 'D'. (This enforces immediate punishment for defection).
        *   **However, introduce a condition for forgiveness:** If `trust_level` has recovered to a certain point (e.g., `trust_level > 0.7`) *and* the number of defectors in the *previous* round was very low, we might decide to cooperate.
        *   A more robust approach for this "return to cooperation" logic:
            *   If `defection_punishment_duration < forgiveness_period` (where `forgiveness_period` is a parameter, e.g., 2 or 3 rounds): Play 'D'.
            *   If `defection_punishment_duration >= forgiveness_period`: Reset `defection_punishment_duration` to 0 and play 'C'. This signifies we've "punished enough."

    *   **Else (if `defection_punishment_duration == 0`):**
        *   Play 'C'. (Default cooperative stance).

**Let's refine again for clarity and robustness. The key is to react to collective behavior, not just individuals, and to manage the transition back to cooperation.**

**Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperation (ARC)"**

*   **Core Principle:** Be cooperative as long as others are, but punish significant defection and gradually forgive sustained cooperation.

**State Variables (maintained per player):**

*   `last_avg_cooperation`: The average cooperation rate of all players in the previous round. Initialized to 1.0.
*   `consecutive_defections`: The number of consecutive rounds the strategy has decided to defect. Initialized to 0.
*   `trust_parameter`: A value (initially high, e.g., 0.8) that represents the minimum average cooperation rate required to trigger immediate cooperation. This parameter will adapt.

**Decision Rules for Round `t`:**

**1. First Round (`t = 1`):**
   *   **Action:** Play 'C'. (Assume good intentions initially).
   *   **Update State:** `last_avg_cooperation = 1.0` (hypothetically, as we assume everyone *would* cooperate if asked).

**2. Subsequent Rounds (`t > 1`):**
   *   **Calculate `current_avg_cooperation`:**
     *   Sum `c_j` for all players `j` in round `t-1`.
     *   `current_avg_cooperation = (sum of c_j) / n`.

   *   **Update `trust_parameter`:**
     *   If `current_avg_cooperation` was very high (e.g., >= 0.9): `trust_parameter = min(1.0, trust_parameter + 0.05)` (increase trust).
     *   If `current_avg_cooperation` was very low (e.g., <= 0.2): `trust_parameter = max(0.2, trust_parameter - 0.1)` (decrease trust, with a floor to prevent complete loss of trust).
     *   Otherwise, `trust_parameter` remains relatively stable or adjusts slightly.

   *   **Decision Logic:**
     *   **If `consecutive_defections > 0`:**
       *   We are currently in a punishment phase.
       *   **If `current_avg_cooperation >= trust_parameter`:**
         *   This indicates a strong return to cooperation from the group.
         *   **Action:** Play 'C'.
         *   **Update State:** `consecutive_defections = 0`.
       *   **Else (`current_avg_cooperation < trust_parameter`):**
         *   The group is still not cooperating enough.
         *   **Action:** Play 'D'.
         *   **Update State:** `consecutive_defections += 1`. (We continue to punish).

     *   **Else (`consecutive_defections == 0`):**
       *   We are in a cooperative stance.
       *   **If `current_avg_cooperation >= trust_parameter`:**
         *   The group is cooperating sufficiently.
         *   **Action:** Play 'C'.
         *   **Update State:** `consecutive_defections = 0` (remains 0).
       *   **Else (`current_avg_cooperation < trust_parameter`):**
         *   There's a significant drop in cooperation.
         *   **Action:** Play 'D'.
         *   **Update State:** `consecutive_defections = 1`. (Start punishment phase).

   *   **Update State:** `last_avg_cooperation = current_avg_cooperation`.

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
n_players = n
num_rounds = r
multiplication_factor = k

trust_parameter = 0.8  // Initial trust threshold for cooperation
consecutive_defections = 0
last_avg_cooperation = 1.0 // Hypothetical for round 1

function decide_action(round_number, historical_actions):
    if round_number == 1:
        return 'C'

    // Get actions from the previous round
    actions_prev_round = historical_actions[round_number - 1] // List of 'C' or 'D' for all players

    // Calculate average cooperation in the previous round
    num_cooperators_prev = count_of('C' in actions_prev_round)
    current_avg_cooperation = num_cooperators_prev / n_players

    // Update trust_parameter
    if current_avg_cooperation >= 0.9:
        trust_parameter = min(1.0, trust_parameter + 0.05)
    elif current_avg_cooperation <= 0.2:
        trust_parameter = max(0.2, trust_parameter - 0.1)
    // else: trust_parameter remains stable

    // Determine action based on current state
    if consecutive_defections > 0:
        // We are in a punishment phase
        if current_avg_cooperation >= trust_parameter:
            // Group is cooperating enough to forgive
            action = 'C'
            consecutive_defections = 0
        else:
            // Group is still not cooperating enough
            action = 'D'
            consecutive_defections += 1
    else:
        // We are in a cooperative phase
        if current_avg_cooperation >= trust_parameter:
            // Group is cooperating
            action = 'C'
            consecutive_defections = 0 // Remains 0
        else:
            // Significant drop in cooperation, start punishment
            action = 'D'
            consecutive_defections = 1

    // Update last_avg_cooperation for the next round's calculation
    last_avg_cooperation = current_avg_cooperation

    return action

```

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`r = 1`):** As specified, the strategy plays 'C'. This is the most cooperative starting point.
*   **Last Round (`r`):** The strategy will play according to the established rules. If the game has reached the last round, the logic of "future rounds" doesn't apply. The strategy will still react to the perceived cooperation level of the penultimate round. This is standard for repeated games with a finite horizon – there's an incentive to defect in the last round. However, our strategy's reaction is based on history, so it will still punish if it perceives insufficient cooperation. If the game has been cooperative, it will likely cooperate even in the last round.
*   **All Players Defect:** If all players always defect, `current_avg_cooperation` will be 0. `trust_parameter` will decrease to its floor (0.2). `consecutive_defections` will increase, and the strategy will continue to defect, mirroring the group behavior.
*   **All Players Cooperate:** If all players always cooperate, `current_avg_cooperation` will be 1.0. `trust_parameter` will increase to 1.0. `consecutive_defections` will remain 0. The strategy will happily cooperate.
*   **Dynamic `n` and `k`:** The strategy uses `n` directly in its calculations. The parameter `k` is not directly used in the decision-making logic of *this specific strategy*. Its influence is on the *payoffs*, which then indirectly shape the observed cooperation rates that our strategy reacts to. The strategy is robust to changes in `k` because it's adaptive.

### 3. Cooperativeness:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins by cooperating, signaling a desire for mutual benefit.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation with more cooperation and punishes defection with defection. This is a cornerstone of cooperative game theory.
*   **Adaptive Threshold (`trust_parameter`):** This is the key to its cooperativeness and robustness. By dynamically adjusting the `trust_parameter`, it:
    *   **Encourages sustained cooperation:** If others cooperate, the `trust_parameter` increases, making it easier to continue cooperating and harder to trigger defection.
    *   **Punishes defection effectively:** If others defect, the `trust_parameter` decreases, making it more likely for the strategy to defect in response.
    *   **Forgives gradual returns to cooperation:** It doesn't immediately return to full trust but requires sustained cooperation to rebuild `trust_parameter`.
*   **Punishment Phase:** The `consecutive_defections` variable ensures that defection is not a one-off event. It provides a period of "punishment" to discourage future defections by others. However, this punishment is capped and can be overcome if the group demonstrates sufficient cooperation.
*   **No Retaliation for Single Deviations:** The `trust_parameter` and `consecutive_defections` mechanism helps to avoid immediate, harsh reactions to single defections. It averages behavior and only triggers strong responses when a trend of defection is established.

This strategy is designed to be a robust, cooperative player that learns from the collective behavior of the group, aiming to foster and maintain a cooperative equilibrium while being able to defend against exploitation.

Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocity with a Trust Threshold"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a forgiving element and a mechanism to avoid perpetual punishment when cooperation is generally beneficial.

### Core Principle:

The strategy is fundamentally based on **reciprocity**, but it incorporates a measure of **trust** and a **threshold** for re-establishing cooperation. It seeks to maintain a high level of cooperation when others are cooperating, and to retaliate against defection, but with a view to returning to cooperation if conditions improve.

### 1. Decision Rules:

**The core decision rule is based on the proportion of players who cooperated in the *previous* round.**

*   **If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was above a certain "cooperation threshold" ($\theta$), then play Cooperate (C).**
*   **If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was at or below the "cooperation threshold" ($\theta$), then play Defect (D).**

**Initial State (Round 1):**

*   In the first round, before any history exists, the strategy will **Cooperate (C)**. This is a foundational act of trust, aiming to seed cooperation.

**The "Cooperation Threshold" ($\theta$):**

The cooperation threshold is a crucial parameter. It represents the minimum level of collective cooperation required for our strategy to consider it worthwhile to cooperate. A good starting point, which can be tuned, is a value slightly above what would make it individually rational to defect.

Let's analyze the payoff for cooperating versus defecting when a proportion `p` of players cooperate:

*   **Payoff for Cooperating:** $\pi_C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) \times (\text{total cooperators})$
*   **Payoff for Defecting:** $\pi_D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) \times (\text{total cooperators})$

For cooperation to be collectively beneficial over a single round compared to everyone defecting (where $\pi_i = 1$), the total payoff needs to be greater than `n`. The total payoff is $k \times (\text{total cooperators})$.

The individual incentive to defect arises when:
$\pi_D > \pi_C$
$1 + (k/n) \times (\text{total cooperators}) > (k/n) \times (\text{total cooperators})$
This is always true when a player defects, so we need to consider the overall outcome.

Individual rationality shifts when the share of the public good from cooperating is less than the cost of contributing (which is 1). This happens when:
$(k/n) \times (\text{total cooperators}) < 1$

So, if the number of cooperators is less than `n/k`, it's individually rational to defect if everyone else cooperates. Conversely, if the number of cooperators is greater than `n/k`, it's individually rational to cooperate.

Therefore, a reasonable **"cooperation threshold" ($\theta$) could be set at $n/k$ proportion of players.**

*   **If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round $\ge n/k$, then play C.**
*   **If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round $< n/k$, then play D.**

**Refinement: Forgiveness and Re-establishment of Cooperation**

While defecting when cooperation is low, we need a mechanism to return to cooperation if others start cooperating again. This is where the "trust" element comes in.

*   **If the strategy is currently defecting (because the previous round's cooperation was below $\theta$), it will switch back to Cooperate (C) in the *next* round IF the proportion of cooperators in the *current* round (the one where it defected) crosses the threshold $\theta$ again.** This allows for recovery from periods of low cooperation.

**Summary of Decision Rules:**

Let $P_{t-1}$ be the proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$.
Let $\theta = n/k$.

*   **Round 1:** Cooperate (C).
*   **Round $t > 1$:**
    *   **If strategy defected in round $t-1$:**
        *   If $P_{t-1} \ge \theta$: Cooperate (C) in round $t$.
        *   If $P_{t-1} < \theta$: Defect (D) in round $t$.
    *   **If strategy cooperated in round $t-1$:**
        *   If $P_{t-1} \ge \theta$: Cooperate (C) in round $t$.
        *   If $P_{t-1} < \theta$: Defect (D) in round $t$.

**This can be simplified:**

For round $t > 1$:
If $P_{t-1} \ge \theta$, play C.
If $P_{t-1} < \theta$, play D.

**However, to implement the "forgiveness" mechanism explicitly, we need to track the strategy's own past action.**

Let $A_{i,t}$ be the action of player $i$ in round $t$.
Let $N_C(t)$ be the number of cooperators in round $t$.
Let $P_t = N_C(t) / n$ be the proportion of cooperators in round $t$.
Let $\theta = n/k$.

**Strategy "Adaptive Reciprocity with a Trust Threshold":**

1.  **Initialize:** `cooperate_this_round = True` (to play C in round 1).
2.  **For round $t = 1$ to $r$:**
    *   **My Action:** Play the action determined by `cooperate_this_round`.
    *   **Observe History:** After the round, observe $P_{t-1}$ (if $t>1$).
    *   **Decision for Next Round:**
        *   If $P_{t-1} \ge \theta$: Set `cooperate_this_round = True`.
        *   If $P_{t-1} < \theta$: Set `cooperate_this_round = False`.
        *   **(Crucially, for forgiveness):** If my *own* action in round $t-1$ was Defect, *and* $P_{t-1} \ge \theta$, then I should override the decision above and set `cooperate_this_round = True`.

This forgiveness rule needs careful formulation to avoid infinite loops or immediate forgiveness after a single defection. Let's refine this.

**Revised Decision Rule with Forgiveness:**

Let $A_{i,t-1}$ be our action in round $t-1$.
Let $P_{t-1}$ be the proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$.
Let $\theta = n/k$.

*   **Round 1:** Play C.
*   **Round $t > 1$:**
    *   **Condition for Cooperation:** Cooperate if $P_{t-1} \ge \theta$.
    *   **Condition for Defection:** Defect if $P_{t-1} < \theta$.
    *   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** If we defected in round $t-1$ (i.e., $A_{i,t-1} = D$) AND in the current round $t$ (where we are making the decision for round $t+1$), the proportion of cooperators $P_t$ has risen back above $\theta$, then we switch back to Cooperate for round $t+1$.

This is getting complicated to express in simple rules. Let's simplify the *logic* behind the strategy:

**Strategy: "Threshold Reciprocity with a Return Trigger"**

1.  **Initial State (Round 1):** Always Cooperate.
2.  **General Rule (Rounds $t > 1$):**
    *   If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round ($P_{t-1}$) was at or above the threshold ($\theta = n/k$), then cooperate.
    *   If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round ($P_{t-1}$) was below the threshold ($\theta = n/k$), then defect.
3.  **Forgiveness/Return Trigger:** If I defected in round $t-1$, I will only consider cooperating again in round $t$ if the proportion of cooperators in the *current* round ($P_t$, observed *after* my decision for round $t$ is made but before I play it) has risen back above the threshold $\theta$. This allows me to break out of a cycle of mutual defection if others start cooperating.

This still has a circular dependency. Let's use a state-based approach.

**State-Based Strategy: "Cooperative if Trusted, Punish and Recover"**

**States:**
*   **TRUSTING:** The default state. We assume others will cooperate.
*   **PUNISHING:** We have detected widespread defection and are defecting in response.

**Parameters:**
*   $\theta = n/k$ (Cooperation Threshold)
*   `consecutive_defections_to_punish`: A counter to ensure a strong signal before switching to PUNISHING. Let's say 1.
*   `consecutive_cooperations_to_recover`: A counter to ensure sustained cooperation before returning to TRUSTING. Let's say 1.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1:**
    *   Start in **TRUSTING** state.
    *   Action: Cooperate (C).
    *   Initialize `my_defections_since_trusting = 0`.
    *   Initialize `observed_cooperation_below_threshold = 0`.

2.  **For Round $t = 2$ to $r$:**
    *   Observe $P_{t-1}$ (proportion of cooperators in previous round).
    *   Observe my own action in round $t-1$, $A_{i,t-1}$.

    *   **If current state is TRUSTING:**
        *   **If $P_{t-1} \ge \theta$:**
            *   Action: Cooperate (C).
            *   Increment `observed_cooperation_below_threshold` if $P_{t-1} < \theta$ (this shouldn't happen if we are in TRUSTING and $P_{t-1} \ge \theta$).
            *   `my_defections_since_trusting = 0`.
        *   **If $P_{t-1} < \theta$:**
            *   Action: Defect (D).
            *   Increment `my_defections_since_trusting`.
            *   Increment `observed_cooperation_below_threshold`.
            *   **Transition to PUNISHING state if:** `my_defections_since_trusting >= consecutive_defections_to_punish` OR `observed_cooperation_below_threshold >= consecutive_defections_to_punish`.

    *   **If current state is PUNISHING:**
        *   **If $P_{t-1} \ge \theta$:**
            *   Action: Cooperate (C).
            *   Increment `observed_cooperation_below_threshold` (this resets the count for recovery).
            *   **Transition to TRUSTING state if:** `observed_cooperation_below_threshold >= consecutive_cooperations_to_recover`.
            *   Reset `my_defections_since_trusting = 0`.
        *   **If $P_{t-1} < \theta$:**
            *   Action: Defect (D).
            *   Increment `my_defections_since_trusting`.
            *   Increment `observed_cooperation_below_threshold` (because we are defecting, and it's below threshold).
            *   Remain in PUNISHING state.

**This refined state-based approach seems more robust and clearly defines the transitions.**

Let's simplify the counters for clarity.

**Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness Window"**

**Parameters:**
*   $\theta = n/k$ (Cooperation Threshold)
*   `forgiveness_window_size`: An integer. If we defect, we will consider cooperating again if the *last* `forgiveness_window_size` rounds *all* had a proportion of cooperators $\ge \theta$. Let's set this to 1 for simplicity first, meaning if the last round was $\ge \theta$, we forgive.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1:** Play Cooperate (C).
2.  **For Round $t = 2$ to $r$:**
    *   Observe $P_{t-1}$ (proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$).
    *   Observe my own action in round $t-1$, $A_{i,t-1}$.

    *   **If $P_{t-1} \ge \theta$:**
        *   Action: Cooperate (C).
    *   **If $P_{t-1} < \theta$:**
        *   Action: Defect (D).

    *   **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
        *   If my action in round $t-1$ was Defect ($A_{i,t-1} = D$), *and* the condition for cooperation in step 2 ($P_{t-1} \ge \theta$) is met, then I will play Cooperate (C) in round $t$ *despite* my previous defection. This is an immediate forgiveness if the opponent(s) signal a return to cooperation.

This still doesn't handle the "punishment" phase properly. The simplest way to capture the core idea is:

**Strategy: "Tit-for-Tat generalized to N-Players"**

1.  **Round 1:** Cooperate (C).
2.  **Round $t > 1$:** Cooperate if and only if the proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$ was at or above the threshold $\theta = n/k$. Otherwise, defect.

This is the most direct interpretation of "reciprocity based on group behavior." It's adaptive because it reacts to the group's past behavior. It's robust because it doesn't get stuck in cycles of mutual defection unless the group as a whole consistently falls below the cooperation threshold.

Let's illustrate with an example: n=6, k=2. So $\theta = 6/2 = 3$.
Round 1: Play C.
Round 2:
- If Round 1 had 3+ cooperators: Play C.
- If Round 1 had < 3 cooperators: Play D.
Round 3:
- If Round 2 had 3+ cooperators: Play C.
- If Round 2 had < 3 cooperators: Play D.

This seems to be the most straightforward and robust cooperative strategy that solely depends on the group's history and game parameters. It's inherently cooperative by starting with C and continuing to C as long as the group signals sufficient cooperation.

### 2. Handle Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (r=1 or t=1):** Always Cooperate (C). This is a crucial assumption of cooperation to kickstart the process.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** The strategy plays according to its last computed decision rule. There's no future to influence, but it doesn't change the decision logic. If the goal is to maximize total payoff, then in the absolute last round (if known), a player might rationally defect regardless of history. However, the problem states "repeated game" with $r>1$, and the goal is a *cooperative* strategy. Thus, it continues to apply the same logic. The strategy aims to foster cooperation throughout the *entire* game.

### 3. Be Cooperative:

*   **Starts cooperatively:** Always initiates with cooperation.
*   **Rewards cooperation:** Continues to cooperate as long as the group environment is cooperatively sufficient (proportion of cooperators $\ge \theta$).
*   **Punishes defection (collectively):** Defects when the group falls below the cooperation threshold, signalling that the current level of cooperation is not sustainable or beneficial.
*   **Forgiving:** It doesn't hold grudges indefinitely. If the group returns to a sufficient level of cooperation ($\ge \theta$), it will immediately switch back to cooperating in the next round. This allows for recovery and re-establishment of mutually beneficial cooperation.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Game Parameters
// n: number of players
// r: number of rounds
// k: multiplication factor

// Calculated Parameter
theta = k / n // Cooperation Threshold (float, but interpreted as minimum proportion)

// Strategy State
cooperate_in_next_round = True // Default for round 1

// Function to determine action for a given round
function DecideAction(current_round_number, history):
    // history is a list of (my_action, total_cooperators_in_round) for previous rounds
    // For round 1, history is empty

    if current_round_number == 1:
        cooperate_in_next_round = True
        return "C" // Cooperate in the first round

    // Get information from the previous round
    previous_round_info = history[-1] // Last element is data from round t-1
    my_previous_action = previous_round_info[0] // e.g., "C" or "D"
    total_cooperators_previous_round = previous_round_info[1]

    proportion_cooperators_previous_round = total_cooperators_previous_round / n

    // Determine action based on proportion of cooperators in the previous round
    if proportion_cooperators_previous_round >= theta:
        cooperate_in_next_round = True
    else:
        cooperate_in_next_round = False

    // Note: No explicit "punishment" state is needed if the rule is simply
    // "cooperate if previous proportion >= theta, else defect".
    // This rule inherently incorporates forgiveness because if the group
    // returns to cooperating above theta, we will immediately switch back.

    if cooperate_in_next_round:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"

// Main game loop (for simulation/tournament):
// history = [] // List to store (my_action, total_cooperators) for each round
// for t from 1 to r:
//     my_action = DecideAction(t, history)
//     // ... (send my_action to game environment) ...
//     // ... (receive other players' actions and round outcome) ...
//     // Calculate total_cooperators_this_round
//     // Add (my_action, total_cooperators_this_round) to history
```

This strategy is simple, adaptive, and cooperative. It relies on the collective signal of the group's past behavior to guide its own cooperation. It's robust because it will only defect if the group's cooperation falls below a mathematically defined beneficial threshold and will readily return to cooperation if the group provides that signal.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_108 = '''
This is a fascinating challenge, and I'm excited to design a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game! The core of this game is the tension between individual incentives to defect for a higher immediate payoff and the collective benefit of cooperation. In a repeated setting, reputation and punishment become powerful tools.

My strategy will be a variation of **Grim Trigger with a forgiveness mechanism and an emphasis on the overall cooperative outcome**. The goal is to incentivize cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with enough flexibility to recover from occasional defections without permanently abandoning cooperation.

Here's the design:

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Cooperation with Punitive Forgiveness (ACPF)

### Core Philosophy:

My strategy's core philosophy is to **strive for full cooperation whenever possible, but to react decisively and punitively to deviations from this ideal, while retaining the capacity to forgive and return to cooperation if the collective benefits are re-established.** I will operate with a constant goal of maximizing my long-term payoff by fostering a cooperative environment.

### 1. Decision Rules:

My decision for a given round `t` is based on two main factors:
*   **The overall cooperative trend in recent history.**
*   **The immediate payoff received by myself in the previous round.**

**Decision Logic:**

1.  **Initial Phase (Early Rounds):** In the very early rounds, there's no history to learn from. I will adopt a cautiously optimistic approach.
    *   **Round 1:** **Cooperate (C)**. This signals a willingness to cooperate and allows me to gather initial data on other players' behavior.
    *   **Rounds 2 to `min(r_start_punish, r)`:** **Cooperate (C)**. I will continue to cooperate for a defined "grace period" to observe the collective behavior. `r_start_punish` is a parameter that determines how many rounds I'll wait before I start actively punishing. A good initial value for `r_start_punish` might be around `min(5, r // 2)`. This allows for some initial exploration without immediate punishment.

2.  **Established Phase (Most Rounds):**
    *   **If the average number of cooperators in the last `observation_window` rounds (where `observation_window` is another parameter, e.g., 3 to 5) is greater than or equal to `cooperation_threshold` (e.g., `n * 0.75`), and my payoff in the previous round was satisfactory (meaning I didn't receive the lowest possible payoff from cooperating while others defected), then:** **Cooperate (C)**.
        *   **Satisfactory Payoff Condition:** My payoff in round `t-1` was greater than or equal to `1 + (k/n) * max(0, num_cooperators_in_t_minus_1 - 1)`. This essentially checks if my cooperation was rewarded or at least not severely punished by the defection of others. If others also cooperated, my payoff should be `k`, which is always greater than `1`. If some defected, my payoff could be lower, but this condition helps distinguish between being punished for others' defection versus being "punished" for my own defection (which would be `1`).

    *   **If the average number of cooperators in the last `observation_window` rounds is *less than* `cooperation_threshold`, OR if my payoff in the previous round was significantly low (indicating potential exploitation or a breakdown in cooperation), then:** **Defect (D)**. This is the punitive phase.

3.  **Forgiveness Mechanism:**
    *   After a period of sustained defection (either by me or by the group, reflected in low average cooperation), I will introduce a "forgiveness window."
    *   **If I have been defecting for `punishment_duration` rounds (e.g., 2 to 4 rounds), AND the average number of cooperators in the *last* `observation_window` rounds has *increased significantly* (e.g., by at least `n * 0.25` compared to the previous window, or has reached a new local peak), then:** **Cooperate (C)**. This is the forgiveness trigger. The goal is to re-enter cooperation if the group shows signs of returning to it.

4.  **Last Round Handling:**
    *   **Final Round (`t == r`):** Regardless of history, in the very last round, the incentive to build reputation for future rounds disappears. Therefore, the optimal strategy for the last round is always to **Defect (D)**. This is a standard Nash Equilibrium prediction for the last round of a repeated game.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`r = 1`):** If the game is only for one round, my strategy will simply **Defect (D)**. This aligns with the logic for the last round. *However, the problem statement specifies `r > 1`, so this specific edge case is not directly relevant for the parameters given, but it's good to consider.*

*   **Very Few Players (`n` is small):** The strategy should still hold. The thresholds and windows are scaled by `n` or relative to `r`.

*   **Very High `k` (close to `n`):** In this scenario, cooperation is highly beneficial for everyone. My strategy is designed to promote this. The `cooperation_threshold` should be met more easily, leading to more cooperation.

*   **Very Low `k` (close to 1):** In this scenario, the incentive to defect is much stronger. My strategy will be more likely to enter the punitive phase. The `cooperation_threshold` might be harder to reach.

*   **Sudden Shifts in Opponent Behavior:** The `observation_window` and the "significant increase" trigger for forgiveness are designed to make the strategy adaptive. If opponents suddenly switch from defection to cooperation, the increased average cooperation will trigger forgiveness. If they switch from cooperation to defection, the decrease in average cooperation will trigger punishment.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

My strategy is inherently cooperative in its *intent*. It actively seeks to establish and maintain a state of mutual cooperation. The "punishment" phases are not vindictive; they are strategic tools to **deter free-riding and to guide the group back towards a collectively optimal outcome.**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** I always initiate cooperation in the early rounds and will return to cooperation whenever there are strong signals of it from the group.
*   **Punishment as Deterrence:** The defection is a signal that the current state is unsustainable or exploitative. It aims to correct behavior, not to permanently penalize.
*   **Forgiveness for Future Gains:** The forgiveness mechanism is crucial for long-term cooperation. It recognizes that occasional defections might be mistakes, learning phases, or attempts to test boundaries, and that dwelling on past transgressions can prevent future collective gains.

This strategy is designed to be robust by focusing on observable outcomes (total cooperators) and personal experience (my payoff), while having parameters that can be tuned to adapt to different game environments. It prioritizes long-term collective gain through a cycle of cooperation, punishment, and forgiveness.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_109 = '''
This is an excellent challenge! Designing a cooperative strategy for a repeated Public Goods Game under these constraints requires careful consideration of incentives and adaptation. Since we cannot rely on pre-existing coordination or explicit communication, our strategy must infer and respond to the collective behavior.

Here's a design for a cooperative strategy, focusing on reciprocity and a gentle approach to defection, aiming to foster cooperation while protecting against exploitation.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocity"

This strategy aims to maximize the collective payoff by encouraging cooperation, but it's designed to be robust by punishing deviations and rewarding returns to cooperation. It's adaptive because it learns from past behavior.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Start Cooperative:** Assume the best and try to build cooperation from the ground up.
*   **Reciprocate:** Mirror the behavior of the group to encourage continued cooperation.
*   **Punish Deviations (Gently):** If the group starts to defect, reduce contributions to signal displeasure and avoid being exploited.
*   **Forgive and Forget (with Caution):** If cooperation returns, be willing to rejoin it.
*   **Long-Term Focus:** The repeated nature of the game allows for building trust and overcoming short-term temptations.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) for player `i` in round `t` is determined by a combination of the group's recent behavior and the current round number.

*   **Initial Decision (Round 1): Cooperate (C)**
    *   We begin by assuming cooperative intentions and attempt to establish a cooperative norm.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1): Adaptive Reciprocity**
    *   **Monitor Group Behavior:** Calculate the proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round (`t-1`). Let `cooperator_proportion_{t-1}` be this value.
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   **If `cooperator_proportion_{t-1}` is high (e.g., ≥ 0.7):** Play **Cooperate (C)**. This threshold indicates that the majority is cooperating, and we should reinforce this positive behavior.
        *   **If `cooperator_proportion_{t-1}` is moderate (e.g., 0.4 ≤ `cooperator_proportion_{t-1}` < 0.7):** Play **Cooperate (C)**. This is a "grace period" where we might still be trying to build cooperation or recover from minor defections. We're giving the group the benefit of the doubt.
        *   **If `cooperator_proportion_{t-1}` is low (e.g., < 0.4):** Play **Defect (D)**. This is a signal that collective cooperation is breaking down, and we need to protect our endowment from being exploited. We are not aggressively punishing, but rather stepping back to reduce our losses.
        *   **Special Consideration for Low Proportions:** If `cooperator_proportion_{t-1}` drops below a certain very low threshold (e.g., < 0.2), and we have been defecting in the previous round, continue to **Defect (D)**. This prevents us from being drawn back into a failing cooperative effort too quickly.

*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** If the group's `cooperator_proportion` was low in the previous round (leading us to defect), and in the *current* round, the `cooperator_proportion_{t-1}` becomes high again (e.g., ≥ 0.7), we will switch back to **Cooperate (C)**. This allows for recovery from a period of defection.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t = 1):** Always **Cooperate (C)**. As stated above, this is our initial attempt to foster cooperation.

*   **Last Round (t = r):** In the very last round, the incentive to cooperate is significantly reduced because there are no future rounds to benefit from collective cooperation. The rational choice for any self-interested player becomes **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Decision Rule for Last Round:** Always play **Defect (D)** in round `r`. This is a strategic concession to the known incentive structure of the final round.

*   **If all players play D in the previous round:** If `cooperator_proportion_{t-1} = 0`, we will play **Defect (D)**. This is consistent with the "low proportion" rule.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The "Adaptive Reciprocity" strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its *intent*. It prioritizes establishing and maintaining cooperation.

*   **High Cooperation Thresholds:** We are forgiving and will continue to cooperate even when cooperation dips slightly (e.g., up to 0.7 proportion of cooperators). This provides a strong incentive for others to continue cooperating, as deviations are not immediately met with defection.
*   **Gradual Punishment:** When cooperation declines, we don't immediately retaliate with full defection. Instead, we reduce our contribution by defecting, sending a signal and protecting our endowment without escalating conflict.
*   **Rejoin Cooperation:** The forgiveness mechanism is crucial. If the group shows signs of returning to cooperative behavior, we readily rejoin, demonstrating our commitment to the collective good.
*   **Maximizing Collective Payoff:** By trying to foster cooperation for as long as possible, this strategy aims to achieve the highest total payoff for all players, which aligns with a cooperative mindset. The deviation to defection is a protective measure, not an aggressive one.

    cooperator_proportion_prev_round = 1.0 // Assume full cooperation if no history available (fallback)

  // Decision Logic based on previous round's behavior
  IF cooperator_proportion_prev_round >= 0.7:
    RETURN "C" // High cooperation, continue cooperating
  ELSE IF cooperator_proportion_prev_round >= 0.4:
    RETURN "C" // Moderate cooperation, still giving benefit of doubt
  ELSE: // cooperator_proportion_prev_round < 0.4
    // Check if we defected last round and group is still very low
    IF length(cooperator_proportion_history) > 0 AND cooperator_proportion_history[-1] < 0.4 AND cooperator_proportion_prev_round < 0.2:
      RETURN "D" // Stay defecting if group is in severe decline
    ELSE:
      RETURN "D" // Low cooperation, signal by defecting

  // This part is implicitly handled by the forgiveness logic below,
  // but can be made explicit: if we defected due to low proportion,
  // and now proportion is high, we should cooperate.
  // The current structure handles this by the ">= 0.7" check in the next round.


// After deciding action, update history for next round
// This update would be managed by the tournament system, but conceptually:
// If decided_action == "C":
//   record_my_action("C")
// Else:
//   record_my_action("D")
// record_cooperator_proportion_history(cooperator_proportion_prev_round) // For internal use in the next round's decision

```

**Explanation of Thresholds (0.7 and 0.4):**

These thresholds are chosen to be generally robust but could be tuned based on empirical results from the tournament.

*   **`>= 0.7`:** This is a strong indicator that the group is successfully cooperating. Deviating here would be counterproductive.
*   **`0.4 <= ... < 0.7`:** This is a "gray area." Cooperation is not perfect but also not collapsing. Continuing to cooperate here is a low-cost way to encourage the group to return to higher levels of cooperation. It avoids premature "punishment" that could backfire.
*   **`< 0.4`:** This is a clear signal that collective cooperation is failing. Defecting here is a defensive measure to minimize losses. The additional check for `< 0.2` when the group is in severe decline prevents immediate re-entry into a broken cooperative system.

This strategy aims to be a reliable and principled participant, striving for the best collective outcome while being resilient to defection.

Here's a design for a cooperative strategy in the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness within the specified constraints.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Cooperation with Forgiveness"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by initially assuming good intentions and rewarding cooperative behavior, while also having a mechanism to punish defection and potentially return to cooperation. It's designed to be adaptive to the emergent behavior of other players.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of this strategy is conditional cooperation. A player using this strategy will cooperate by default but will adjust their behavior based on the actions of other players in previous rounds.

*   **Default Action:** Cooperate (C).
*   **Trigger for Defection:** Defect (D) if the overall level of cooperation in the *previous round* falls below a certain threshold.
*   **Trigger for Returning to Cooperation:** Return to Cooperate (C) if the overall level of cooperation in the *previous round* rises above a certain threshold after a period of defection.

**Defining Thresholds:**

*   **Cooperation Threshold for Defection ($\theta_D$):** The minimum proportion of cooperators in the previous round that will induce this player to defect in the current round.
*   **Cooperation Threshold for Returning ($\theta_C$):** The minimum proportion of cooperators in the previous round that will induce this player to return to cooperating, after having defected.

**Rationale for Thresholds:**

*   We want to encourage cooperation. If the group is generally cooperating, this strategy should too.
*   We need a way to punish free-riding. If too many players defect, this strategy should retaliate.
*   We need a way to recover from periods of defection if the group starts cooperating again.

**Specific Decision Logic:**

Let $N_{cooperators, t-1}$ be the number of players who played C in round $t-1$.
Let $P_{cooperators, t-1} = N_{cooperators, t-1} / n$ be the proportion of cooperators in round $t-1$.

*   **If $P_{cooperators, t-1} \ge \theta_C$:** Play C. (This signifies that cooperation is being sustained or is recovering).
*   **Else if $P_{cooperators, t-1} < \theta_D$:** Play D. (This signifies that the level of cooperation has fallen too low, and free-riding is prevalent).
*   **Else (i.e., $\theta_D \le P_{cooperators, t-1} < \theta_C$):** Play the same action as in the previous round ($t-1$). (This introduces a degree of inertia and forgiveness. If the cooperation level is mediocre, it doesn't immediately trigger a switch, allowing for a potential stabilization.)

**Choosing Threshold Values:**

The exact values of $\theta_D$ and $\theta_C$ will influence the strategy's aggressiveness and forgiveness. A good starting point, balancing cooperation and punishment, could be:

*   $\theta_D \approx k/n$: This is the point where the public good contribution is just enough to compensate cooperators for their endowment. If the group falls below this, it's generally not beneficial to cooperate individually.
*   $\theta_C \approx k/n + \epsilon$ (where $\epsilon$ is a small positive value, e.g., 0.05): This ensures that cooperation is not only sustained but slightly above the break-even point for returning to cooperation, reinforcing positive behavior.

**Example with chosen thresholds (n=6, k=2):**
Here $k/n = 2/6 \approx 0.33$.
Let's set $\theta_D = 0.33$ and $\theta_C = 0.40$.

*   If $P_{cooperators, t-1} \ge 0.40$: Play C.
*   If $P_{cooperators, t-1} < 0.33$: Play D.
*   Else (if $0.33 \le P_{cooperators, t-1} < 0.40$): Play same action as round $t-1$.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:** In the absence of any history, the strategy will default to its cooperative stance.
    *   **Decision Rule for Round 1:** Play C.
    *   **Rationale:** Start with the intended cooperative behavior. We are trying to build cooperation from the ground up.

*   **Last Round (Round $r$):** In a repeated game with a known finite end, standard game theory predicts a shift towards defection (backward induction). However, to remain *cooperative* and adaptive, the strategy should maintain its conditional logic. While the *incentive* to cooperate for future rounds disappears, the *strategy's instruction* is to be conditional on past behavior.
    *   **Decision Rule for Round $r$:** Apply the same decision logic as any other round, based on the outcomes of round $r-1$.
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy is defined by its conditional rules. To introduce a special rule for the last round would be to break the established logic of the strategy. While other players might defect in the last round, this strategy's goal is to be cooperative and robust, which means sticking to its principles. If the history of round $r-1$ dictates cooperation, it will cooperate. If it dictates defection, it will defect. This is consistent with the goal of being adaptive and not relying on specific coordination.

### 3. Being Cooperative

The core of this strategy is to initiate and sustain cooperation whenever possible.

*   **Initiation:** It begins by cooperating, setting a positive example.
*   **Reinforcement:** It cooperates if the group is cooperative or shows signs of recovering cooperation. This rewards and encourages others.
*   **Punishment (as a tool for recovery):** Defection is used not as an end in itself, but as a response to pervasive free-riding. The "forgiveness" element (playing the same action in intermediate cooperation levels) is key. This means it doesn't permanently punish, but rather signals a dissatisfaction that can be rectified by increased cooperation from others.
*   **No Aggression:** It doesn't seek to exploit or dominate. Its goal is to find a stable, mutually beneficial cooperative equilibrium if one can be reached.
*   **Robustness:** By being conditional and having a recovery mechanism, it can adapt to a variety of opponent strategies, including aggressive defectors (it will eventually defect back), pure cooperators (it will always cooperate), and strategies that mix cooperation and defection.

description_COOPERATIVE_111 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, aiming for robustness and adaptiveness in a tournament setting. The core principle is to foster cooperation as long as it remains mutually beneficial, but to be prepared to defect if cooperation breaks down.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Cooperation with Punishment and Forgiveness"

This strategy is designed to be primarily cooperative, aiming to achieve the highest possible collective payoff. It balances the desire for mutual benefit from cooperation with the need to protect oneself from exploitation. The strategy is adaptive, meaning it learns from past interactions and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) for player *i* in round *t* depends on the observed behavior of other players in previous rounds and the overall payoff achieved.

**Core Logic:**

*   **Default Action: Cooperate (C)**
    The strategy defaults to cooperation, aiming to trigger the beneficial outcome of collective contribution.

*   **Trigger for Defection (Punishment):**
    If the observed average payoff per round for *player i* in *all previous rounds* falls below a certain threshold, the strategy will switch to Defection (D). This threshold represents a minimum acceptable payoff that player *i* expects to receive if cooperation is to be sustained.

*   **Condition for Returning to Cooperation (Forgiveness/Re-establishment of Trust):**
    If the strategy has defected in previous rounds due to perceived exploitation, it will return to cooperating if and only if *all other players* collectively exhibit a strong pattern of cooperation for a sustained period. This means a significant majority of other players must be cooperating consistently, and the resulting average payoff for *player i* must rise above the punishment threshold.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t = 1): Cooperate (C)**
    In the very first round, with no historical data, the strategy initiates cooperation. This is the most logical starting point to try and establish the mutually beneficial outcome.

*   **Last Round (t = r): Defect (D)**
    In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. Since cooperation is costly in terms of the endowment kept (1 unit), and there's no prospect of future gains from sustained cooperation, the rational choice for self-preservation is to defect. This is a standard and well-established outcome in repeated games with a known finite end.

*   **Rounds Approaching the End (e.g., t > r - 3):**
    As the game nears its end, the incentive to cooperate diminishes. The strategy will become more cautious. If the current average payoff per round is already below the punishment threshold, it will defect. Otherwise, it will continue to assess the situation, but the likelihood of defecting increases.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The strategy is inherently cooperative in its design:

*   **Default to Cooperation:** The primary impulse is to contribute to the public good, aiming for the higher collective payoffs.
*   **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The decision to defect is not arbitrary but is a response to a perceived breakdown of mutual benefit, where other players are disproportionately benefiting from the strategy's cooperation.
*   **"Forgiveness" Mechanism:** The strategy is willing to re-establish cooperation if the environment becomes conducive to it, meaning others are also demonstrating a commitment to cooperation. This prevents a permanent descent into mutual defection.
*   **Punishment as a Deterrent:** The defection is a signaling mechanism, a way to communicate dissatisfaction with the current payoff and encourage others to change their behavior. It's a temporary measure to restore a more equitable and beneficial equilibrium.

### Explanation of Parameters and Heuristics:

*   **`punishment_threshold`**: This is the most critical parameter. It determines how tolerant the strategy is of low payoffs.
    *   **If `punishment_threshold` is too high:** The strategy will defect too easily, even when minor dips in payoff occur, leading to premature collapse of cooperation.
    *   **If `punishment_threshold` is too low:** The strategy might be exploited for too long before defecting, leading to significantly lower overall payoffs.
    *   **Calculation:** A reasonable starting point could be `1 + (k/n) * (n-1) * 0.2`. This assumes that a payoff of 1 is guaranteed (by defecting), and we aim for a bit more. The `(k/n) * (n-1) * 0.2` term represents an expected benefit from others cooperating, with a multiplier (0.2) for conservatism. The key is that `1 + (k/n)` is the payoff for cooperating when everyone else defects. The threshold must be higher than this to incentivize cooperation.

*   **`cooldown_period_for_forgiveness`**: This parameter dictates how much evidence of good behavior is needed from others before the strategy is willing to trust them again after a period of defection. A value of 3 means at least 3 consecutive rounds where most other players cooperated.

*   **`threshold` for `count_consecutive_rounds`**: This determines what constitutes "high cooperation" from others. A heuristic of `0.8` (80% of others cooperating) is a good starting point, as it requires a strong majority to signal a shift back towards cooperation.

### Robustness and Adaptiveness:

*   **Robustness:**
    *   **To Defection:** The strategy is robust to spontaneous defection by others because it has a mechanism to detect falling payoffs and retaliate by defecting.
    *   **To Exploitation:** It's robust against being a "sucker" by not allowing sustained low payoffs.
    *   **To the Last Round:** The defection in the last round is a standard game-theoretic outcome and prevents manipulation.

*   **Adaptiveness:**
    *   **Learning Payoffs:** The `current_average_payoff_self` dynamically adjusts, allowing the strategy to react to changes in group behavior.
    *   **"Forgiveness" Reset:** The strategy can return to cooperation if the environment changes and other players demonstrate a commitment to collective good. This is crucial for adapting to situations where initial defection might have been a transient phase.
    *   **Parameter Tuning:** The specific values for `punishment_threshold` and `cooldown_period_for_forgiveness` can be tuned based on observations of opponent strategies and tournament outcomes, making it adaptable in a meta-game sense.

This strategy aims to be a strong contender by balancing cooperative intent with rational self-interest, crucial for navigating the complexities of repeated public goods games.

description_COOPERATIVE_112 = '''
This strategy aims to foster cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by balancing the desire for individual gain with the understanding that collective cooperation yields a higher total payoff. It's an adaptive strategy that learns from the history of play and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Cooperative, Adaptive Strategy for N-Player Public Goods Game

**Core Philosophy:** Initiate cooperation and reward it, but punish defection to discourage free-riding and ultimately incentivize a return to cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules

Our strategy, which we'll call **"Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Threshold" (ATT-T)**, will primarily operate based on the following rules:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the very first round, we will always cooperate (play 'C'). This sets a cooperative tone and signals our willingness to engage in mutual benefit.
*   **Responding to Cooperation:** If, in the previous round, the *average* number of cooperators (across all players) was at least a certain threshold, we will continue to cooperate in the current round.
*   **Responding to Defection:** If, in the previous round, the *average* number of cooperators fell below the threshold, we will defect (play 'D') in the current round. This acts as a punishment for insufficient collective contribution.
*   **Returning to Cooperation:** After defecting, we will return to cooperating *only if* the average number of cooperators in the *previous* round was at or above our threshold. This allows for a "grace period" of punishment, but encourages players to regain trust.

**Defining the "Threshold":**

The threshold is a crucial element of this strategy. It represents the minimum level of collective cooperation we deem acceptable to sustain our own cooperation. A higher threshold demands more from the group, while a lower threshold is more forgiving.

For robustness and adaptability, we will set the threshold based on the game parameters. A reasonable starting point, and one that balances individual incentive with group benefit, is:

**`Threshold = floor(n * k / n)`**

Since `1 < k < n`, this simplifies to:

**`Threshold = floor(k)`**

This means the threshold is the integer part of the multiplication factor `k`. If `k` is an integer, then the threshold is simply `k`. This threshold is motivated by the fact that if `k` players cooperate, the payoff for cooperators is `0 + (k/n) * k`. If `k` players defect, cooperators get `0` and defectors get `1`. If the number of cooperators is less than `k`, defectors are better off. If it's greater than or equal to `k`, cooperators are better off.

**Refinement on Returning to Cooperation:**

To make the strategy more forgiving and encourage re-establishment of cooperation, we will refine the rule for returning to cooperation. Instead of immediately returning to 'C' if the threshold is met after a 'D', we will introduce a **"grace period"** or **"probationary cooperation"**.

*   If we have defected in the previous round, we will only return to cooperating if:
    1.  The average number of cooperators in the previous round was at or above the `Threshold`.
    2.  AND the number of players who defected in the previous round was *less than* a certain proportion of the total players (e.g., `n/2` or `n/3`). This prevents us from returning to cooperation if the group is still heavily defecting, even if the average is above the threshold.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always Cooperate ('C'). This is the initial signal to the group.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the last round, the incentive to maintain future cooperation disappears. Therefore, in the last round, our strategy is to **always Defect ('D')**. This is a standard approach in repeated games as it maximizes individual gain when there are no future consequences for defection.
*   **Rounds where History is Insufficient:** For rounds where calculating the "average number of cooperators" is not yet possible (i.e., before the first round's outcome is known), our default is to Cooperate ('C'). This primarily applies to the first round, which is already covered.

### 3. Cooperativeness Alignment

This strategy is inherently cooperative in its initial inclination and its desire to maintain a cooperative environment.

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** We start by cooperating, demonstrating a willingness to contribute to the collective good.
*   **Rewarding Cooperation:** We continue to cooperate as long as the group demonstrates a sufficient level of collective effort (meeting the `Threshold`). This incentivizes other players to cooperate by showing them that their cooperation is reciprocated and beneficial.
*   **Punishing Defection (Gently):** Defection is met with a period of individualistic play ('D'). However, this punishment is not permanent. It serves as a signal that the current state is suboptimal and provides an opportunity for the group to return to a more beneficial cooperative equilibrium. The refined rule for returning to cooperation makes this punishment less harsh, allowing for a quicker re-establishment of cooperation once the group shows signs of improvement.
*   **Adaptability:** The strategy adapts to the observed behavior of other players. If the group consistently cooperates, we will too. If they consistently defect, we will defect as well. This makes it robust to various opponent strategies, from purely selfish to those attempting to exploit cooperative play.
*   **Focus on Total Payoff:** While individual gains are considered, the underlying motivation is that a consistently cooperative state (where all play 'C') yields the highest total payoff for all players (2 per player in the example, versus 1 per player when all defect). This strategy aims to guide the game towards that mutually beneficial outcome.

description_COOPERATIVE_113 = '''
This strategy aims to promote cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, while remaining adaptable to the evolving behavior of other players. It is designed to be robust and to clearly align with a cooperative mindset.

## Cooperative Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

The core idea behind ATFT is to start cooperatively and then mirror the behavior of the group, with a slight bias towards cooperation. It adjusts its response based on the overall level of cooperation observed in the previous round.

### 1. Decision Rules

My decision in round $t$ depends on the observed actions of *all* players in round $t-1$.

*   **In the first round (t=1): Cooperate (C)**
    *   The initial stance is always cooperative to signal a willingness to engage in the public good.

*   **In subsequent rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Calculate the average cooperation rate in the previous round (t-1):** Let $N_C(t-1)$ be the number of players who played 'C' in round $t-1$. The average cooperation rate is $P_C(t-1) = N_C(t-1) / n$.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If $P_C(t-1) \ge \theta$ (Cooperation Threshold): Cooperate (C)**
            *   The strategy cooperates if the proportion of cooperators in the previous round meets or exceeds a predefined threshold $\theta$. This encourages sustained cooperation when the group is generally cooperative.
        *   **If $P_C(t-1) < \theta$ (Cooperation Threshold): Defect (D)**
            *   If the group's cooperation rate falls below the threshold, the strategy defects. This acts as a punishment for insufficient cooperation, signaling that 'C' is not reciprocated by the group.

    *   **The Cooperation Threshold ($\theta$):**
        *   The threshold $\theta$ is crucial for balancing the incentive to cooperate with the need to protect one's own endowment. A reasonable starting point for $\theta$ would be slightly above the "critical threshold" for ensuring a net positive payoff from cooperation.
        *   **Calculating the Critical Threshold:** For a player to have a net gain from cooperating *when all others defect*, their payoff must be greater than the payoff from defecting:
            $(1 - 1) + (k/n) \times n > (1 - 0) + (k/n) \times (n-1)$
            $k > 1$
            This is already guaranteed by the game parameters ($1 < k < n$).
        *   However, for *sustained* cooperation, we need to consider a scenario where *everyone* cooperates. If everyone cooperates, payoff is $k$. If everyone defects, payoff is 1. For cooperation to be potentially stable, we'd want $k > 1$.
        *   More critically, consider the payoff difference between cooperating and defecting when a fraction $x$ of others cooperate. If player $i$ cooperates, payoff is $(k/n)(x+1)$. If player $i$ defects, payoff is $1 + (k/n)x$. Player $i$ prefers to cooperate if $(k/n)(x+1) > 1 + (k/n)x \implies k/n > 1 \implies k > n$. This is not the case.
        *   The condition for defection to be a dominant strategy is when the payoff from defecting is *always* higher, regardless of others' actions. If player $i$ defects, their payoff is $1 + (k/n) \times (\text{number of other cooperators})$. If player $i$ cooperates, their payoff is $(k/n) \times (\text{number of other cooperators} + 1)$.
            Player $i$ defects if $1 + (k/n) \times (\text{num other cooperators}) > (k/n) \times (\text{num other cooperators} + 1)$
            $1 > k/n$. This is true given $k<n$.
        *   So, in a single round, defecting is always individually rational. However, in a repeated game, cooperation can emerge.
        *   The **critical cooperation rate ($p_{crit}$) for the collective to be better off if everyone cooperates than if everyone defects** is where $k > n \times 1$ (everyone defects) vs $k \times n > n \times 1$ (everyone cooperates). This is always true for $k>1$.
        *   The **critical cooperation rate for an individual to be better off cooperating when others cooperate**, versus defecting:
            If $j$ other players cooperate, and player $i$ cooperates, payoff is $0 + (k/n)(j+1)$.
            If $j$ other players cooperate, and player $i$ defects, payoff is $1 + (k/n)j$.
            Cooperate if: $(k/n)(j+1) > 1 + (k/n)j \implies k/n > 1 \implies k > n$. (This is not the case, so defection is always tempting if others cooperate).
        *   The **critical cooperation rate for an individual to be better off cooperating when others defect**, versus defecting:
            If 0 other players cooperate, and player $i$ cooperates, payoff is $0 + (k/n)(1) = k/n$.
            If 0 other players cooperate, and player $i$ defects, payoff is $1 + (k/n)(0) = 1$.
            Cooperate if: $k/n > 1 \implies k > n$. (This is not the case).
        *   **The true critical threshold for sustainable cooperation is where the total gain from cooperation outweighs the individual temptation to defect.** This often arises in the context of the Folk Theorem and trigger strategies. A common threshold for similar games is often related to $1/k$.
        *   For this specific game, the "critical contribution rate" for the group to maximize its total payoff is $n$. The total payoff is $n \times (1 - c_i) + k \times \sum c_j$. If all cooperate, total payoff is $k \times n$. If all defect, total payoff is $n$. Since $k > 1$, $k \times n > n$.
        *   The decision rule for defection is to defect if $\sum c_j / n < \theta$. If player $i$ defects, they get $1 + (k/n) \times (\text{number of cooperators})$. If player $i$ cooperates, they get $(k/n) \times (\text{number of cooperators} + 1)$. Player $i$ will defect if $1 + (k/n)N_C < (k/n)(N_C+1) \implies 1 < k/n \implies k > n$, which is not the case.
        *   The temptation to defect arises when your individual gain from defecting (1) is greater than your share of the public good from your own contribution $(k/n)$.
        *   A stable equilibrium can be achieved if the *punishment* for defection is severe enough.
        *   **Recommended Threshold ($\theta$):** A good starting point for $\theta$ is the **minimum proportion of cooperators required such that the average payoff for a cooperator is at least as good as the average payoff for a defector in a mixed group, and more importantly, that continued cooperation is not suicidal.**
            Let $N_C$ be the number of cooperators.
            Payoff of Cooperator: $(k/n) \times (N_C+1)$
            Payoff of Defector: $1 + (k/n) \times N_C$
            We want the group to cooperate if the average payoff for cooperators is high enough. A reasonable heuristic is to set $\theta$ such that the *overall* group payoff is incentivized. The critical value for $\theta$ often arises when the payoff of defecting equals the payoff of cooperating for an individual within the group.
            Let's consider the point where a player might switch from cooperating to defecting. This happens when $1 + (k/n)N_C > (k/n)(N_C+1)$, which simplifies to $1 > k/n$, or $k < n$. This is always true.
            However, for the strategy to be *cooperative*, we need to sustain cooperation. The strategy aims to maintain cooperation as long as the group effort is significant.
            Let's consider the condition where defecting yields a higher payoff than cooperating when a certain proportion of the group cooperates.
            Player $i$'s payoff if they cooperate: $(k/n)(N_C+1)$
            Player $i$'s payoff if they defect: $1 + (k/n)N_C$
            Player $i$ defects if $1 + (k/n)N_C > (k/n)(N_C+1) \implies 1 > k/n \implies k < n$. This means defecting is *always* individually rational in a single round if your own contribution is not accounted for in the threshold calculation.

            A more robust threshold, considering group stability and average payoff, would be derived from scenarios where cooperation is *collectively* beneficial. A common approach in repeated games is to consider thresholds related to the inverse of the multiplication factor or other game-specific ratios.

            **For this strategy, a practical and robust $\theta$ would be $1/k$.**
            *   If $P_C(t-1) \ge 1/k$: Cooperate (C)
            *   If $P_C(t-1) < 1/k$: Defect (D)

            Why $1/k$?
            *   If the proportion of cooperators is less than $1/k$, it means that the total contribution $(n \times P_C)$ is less than $n/k$. The total return to the public good $(k/n) \times (n \times P_C)$ would be less than $(k/n) \times (n/k) = 1$. This implies the public good is not generating enough value to offset the "cost" of one person defecting (the private gain of 1). In such scenarios, defecting becomes more attractive.
            *   If $P_C(t-1) \ge 1/k$, then the total number of cooperators is $N_C = n \times P_C \ge n/k$. The total contribution is at least $n/k$. The total return to the public good is $(k/n) \times N_C \ge (k/n) \times (n/k) = 1$. This indicates that the collective benefit from cooperation is at least significant enough to consider continuing cooperation. This threshold dynamically adjusts based on $k$, favoring more cooperation when $k$ is high (making cooperation more rewarding).

*   **The Last Round (t=r): Defect (D)**
    *   In the final round, the incentive to cooperate vanishes because there are no future rounds to be rewarded for cooperation. This is the "end-game problem." Therefore, to maximize individual payoff in the last round, defecting is the rational choice.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** As stated above, always **Cooperate (C)**. This initiates a cooperative stance.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** As stated above, always **Defect (D)**. This addresses the end-game problem.
*   **All Players Defect in the Previous Round ($N_C(t-1) = 0$):** If all players defected, $P_C(t-1) = 0$. Since $1/k > 0$, $P_C(t-1) < 1/k$. My strategy will **Defect (D)**. This correctly responds to universal defection.
*   **All Players Cooperate in the Previous Round ($N_C(t-1) = n$):** If all players cooperated, $P_C(t-1) = 1$. If $1 \ge 1/k$ (which is true since $k>1$), my strategy will **Cooperate (C)**. This reinforces cooperation when it's reciprocated.

### 3. Being Cooperative

*   **Initiation:** The strategy starts with cooperation, demonstrating a willingness to build collective benefits.
*   **Reciprocity:** It mirrors the group's behavior by cooperating when the group cooperates above a threshold and defecting when the group's cooperation falls below it. This is a form of reciprocal altruism adapted to group dynamics.
*   **Resilience:** It is designed to be robust to a range of behaviors. If other players are consistently cooperative, it will remain cooperative. If they are inconsistent or prone to defection, it will punish defection by also defecting, thereby protecting its own endowment.
*   **Fairness Incentive:** The threshold $1/k$ ensures that cooperation is sustained as long as the collective return from cooperation is reasonably significant. It encourages players to reach a level of cooperation where the total output is beneficial for the group.
*   **Adaptability:** The strategy's decision rule is purely based on the observed history of the game and the game parameters, making it adaptive to changing group dynamics without requiring explicit communication or pre-programmed coordination.

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION AdaptiveTitForTat(n, r, k, history):
  // n: number of players
  // r: total number of rounds
  // k: multiplication factor
  // history: list of lists, where history[t-1] contains actions of all players in round t-1

  current_round = len(history) + 1

  // Handle the last round
  IF current_round == r THEN
    RETURN "D" // Defect in the last round

  // Handle the first round
  IF current_round == 1 THEN

  cooperation_threshold = 1.0 / k // The threshold for cooperation

  IF proportion_cooperators_previous_round >= cooperation_threshold THEN
    RETURN "C" // Cooperate if group cooperation is sufficient
  ELSE
    RETURN "D" // Defect if group cooperation falls below threshold
  END IF

END FUNCTION
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

*   The `history` parameter would be a list of lists, where each inner list contains the actions ('C' or 'D') of all $n$ players for a given round. `history[0]` would be the actions from round 1, `history[1]` from round 2, and so on.
*   `current_round` is calculated based on the length of the `history`. If `history` is empty, it's round 1. If it has one entry (actions from round 1), it's round 2, and so on.
*   The logic first checks for the special cases of the last round and the first round.
*   For intermediate rounds, it retrieves the actions from the immediately preceding round (`current_round - 2` because lists are 0-indexed and `history` contains round 1, round 2, ... actions).
*   It then calculates the proportion of players who cooperated in that previous round.
*   Finally, it compares this proportion to the `cooperation_threshold` ($1/k$) to decide whether to cooperate or defect.

Let's design a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game. The core idea is to incentivize cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, while aiming to maximize collective benefit. Given the repeated nature of the game and the perfect information, we can employ a strategy that learns and adapts.

**Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Plus (TFT+)**

This strategy is an evolution of the classic Tit-for-Tat strategy, adapted for a multi-player environment with a public good. It emphasizes initial cooperation, reciprocity, and a mechanism to break out of sustained defection cycles.

---

### Strategy Description: Tit-for-Tat Plus (TFT+)

**Core Principle:** Be nice, retaliate when wronged, and forgive under certain conditions. We aim to establish and maintain a high level of cooperation.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the very first round, player `i` will **Cooperate (C)**. This sets a cooperative tone and is a standard starting point for many successful strategies in repeated games.
*   **Reciprocal Cooperation/Defection:** In any round `t > 1`, player `i`'s decision will primarily be based on the collective behavior of the other players in the previous round `t-1`.
    *   **Cooperate (C) if:** The *average contribution* in the previous round was sufficiently high. We define "sufficiently high" as a threshold that indicates a general willingness to cooperate among the players. A reasonable threshold is when the average `c_j` (where `c_j` is 1 for cooperation and 0 for defection for player `j`) is greater than or equal to `0.5`. This means at least half of the players cooperated in the previous round.
    *   **Defect (D) if:** The *average contribution* in the previous round was below `0.5`. This is our retaliatory response to widespread defection.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism (Adaptive Reciprocity):** While retaliation is important, sustained defection can be detrimental. To avoid getting stuck in a spiral of mutual defection, TFT+ incorporates a forgiveness mechanism.
    *   If player `i` has been defecting for a certain number of consecutive rounds (let's call this `defection_streak`), and the *total number of cooperators* in the *immediately preceding round* (`t-1`) exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 1 or 2 players), player `i` will **attempt to cooperate (C)** again. This allows for the re-establishment of cooperation if a few players are still trying to cooperate, even if the overall average was low. This threshold for forgiveness should be low to encourage breaking cycles.
    *   If player `i` decides to defect, they reset their `defection_streak` to 0. If they cooperate, they also reset their `defection_streak` to 0. If they defect and the forgiveness condition isn't met, the `defection_streak` is incremented.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always **Cooperate (C)**. This is the standard optimistic start.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** In the last round, there is no future interaction to punish or reward. Thus, the incentive for cooperation disappears for purely rational players. However, TFT+ will *continue to follow its established decision rules* even in the last round. If the prior round's conditions warrant cooperation, it will cooperate. If they warrant defection, it will defect. This maintains consistency and prevents a sudden shift in behavior that could be exploited. While there's no *future* incentive to cooperate, there might be a past incentive (if past rounds were cooperative) or a current round's (t-1) assessment.
*   **Early Rounds (t=2 to t ≈ r/2):** The strategy will primarily focus on reciprocity. If cooperation is met with cooperation, it will continue to cooperate. If defection is met with defection, it will continue to defect. The forgiveness mechanism will be less likely to trigger in these early stages unless a significant number of players consistently defect from the start.
*   **Later Rounds (t > r/2):** The forgiveness mechanism becomes more relevant as the game approaches its end. It provides an escape route from prolonged periods of defection.

**3. Being Cooperative:**

TFT+ is fundamentally cooperative. Its primary goals are:

*   **To initiate cooperation:** By starting with C, it signals a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial collective action.
*   **To reward cooperation:** By mirroring the collective behavior (cooperating when most others cooperate), it reinforces positive actions.
*   **To punish defection (but not vindictively):** By defecting when the collective average drops, it discourages free-riding and protects against exploitation.
*   **To facilitate the re-establishment of cooperation:** The forgiveness mechanism is crucial for this. It allows for a return to cooperation even after periods of defection, preventing the game from getting permanently stuck in a low-payoff state. It recognizes that occasional defections might happen or be a response to a temporary imbalance, and doesn't punish them forever.

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Parameters for TFT+
DEFECTION_STREAK_THRESHOLD = 3 // Number of consecutive rounds of defection before forgiveness is considered
FORGIVENESS_COOPERATOR_COUNT_THRESHOLD = 1 // Minimum number of cooperators in the previous round to trigger forgiveness attempt

defection_streak = 0

// Decision function for player i in round t

  // actions is a dictionary like {'player_1': 'C', 'player_2': 'D', ...}

  if round_t == 1:
    return 'C' // Always cooperate in the first round

  // Get actions from the previous round (t-1)
  previous_round_actions = history[round_t - 2]['actions'] // history is 0-indexed, so t-1 is index t-2

  // Calculate number of cooperators and total players in the previous round
  num_cooperators_prev_round = 0
  for player_id, action in previous_round_actions.items():
    if action == 'C':
      num_cooperators_prev_round += 1
  total_players = len(previous_round_actions)
  average_contribution_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round / total_players

  // Decision logic
  if average_contribution_prev_round >= 0.5:
    // If the majority cooperated, cooperate
    defection_streak = 0 // Reset streak as we are cooperating
    return 'C'
  else:
    // If less than half cooperated, consider defection
    // Check for forgiveness mechanism
    if defection_streak >= DEFECTION_STREAK_THRESHOLD and num_cooperators_prev_round >= FORGIVENESS_COOPERATOR_COUNT_THRESHOLD:
      // If we've been defecting for a while, but at least a few others are cooperating,
      // attempt to cooperate to break the cycle.
      defection_streak = 0 // Reset streak as we are attempting cooperation
      return 'C'
    else:
      // Otherwise, defect (retaliate)
      defection_streak += 1 // Increment streak
      return 'D'

// To be used by the AI player. 'history' would be the cumulative game history.
// For round 't', the AI would call: decide_action(t, game_history_up_to_t-1)
```

**Rationale for Robustness and Adaptiveness:**

*   **Adaptiveness:** The strategy constantly assesses the collective behavior of the group and adjusts its strategy accordingly. It doesn't rely on fixed assumptions about opponent behavior but rather on their demonstrated actions.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Against always-defect players:** TFT+ will eventually defect if they do, but it doesn't retaliate disproportionately if the rest of the group cooperates.
    *   **Against always-cooperate players:** TFT+ will cooperate as long as they do, leading to high mutual payoffs.
    *   **Against mixed strategies:** The average contribution metric smooths out individual fluctuations, making the strategy less susceptible to short-term, irrational deviations.
    *   **Against cyclical strategies:** The forgiveness mechanism is designed to break out of cycles of mutual defection.
    *   **Against "unpredictable" strategies:** By focusing on the aggregate behavior, it's less perturbed by individual erratic moves and more by the overall group tendency.

This TFT+ strategy aims to foster a cooperative equilibrium by being forgiving enough to allow for recovery from bad states, yet firm enough to punish free-riding and reward cooperation.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_115 = '''
Here's a strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game that aims for cooperation while remaining adaptive and robust. This strategy is inspired by the **"Tit-for-Tat"** principle but extended for a public goods context.

## Cooperative but Adaptive Strategy: "Generous Tit-for-Tat"

This strategy aims to initiate and sustain cooperation by rewarding it and punishing defection, but with a degree of forgiveness to allow for the re-establishment of cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core idea is to condition our action on the collective behavior of others in the previous round.

*   **Cooperate (C):** If, in the *previous* round, the average payoff for *all players* was sufficiently high, indicating a generally cooperative environment.
*   **Defect (D):** If, in the *previous* round, the average payoff for *all players* was low, indicating a lack of widespread cooperation.

**How to determine "sufficiently high" average payoff?**

We need a threshold. This threshold should be dynamic and adapt to the game's parameters. A reasonable approach is to base it on the *potential* payoff from cooperation.

*   **Cooperate (C):** If the average player payoff in the previous round was **at least 1.0**. This is the payoff a player receives if they defect and everyone else cooperates (or if everyone defects, as calculated in example 1). This serves as a baseline for minimal return. A more ambitious threshold would be higher, but 1.0 is a robust starting point.
*   **Defect (D):** If the average player payoff in the previous round was **less than 1.0**. This signals that the collective benefit of cooperation wasn't realized.

**Refinement for Robustness:** To avoid being overly sensitive to a single round of defection, we can introduce a "forgiveness" mechanism.

*   **Cooperate (C):** If the average player payoff in the previous round was **at least 1.0**, OR if the average payoff was between **0.75 and 1.0** AND this is the first time the average payoff has fallen below 1.0 in the last few rounds (e.g., last 3 rounds).
*   **Defect (D):** If the average player payoff in the previous round was **less than 0.75**, OR if the average payoff was between **0.75 and 1.0** and this is the *second or subsequent* time in the last few rounds that the average has fallen below 1.0.

The threshold of 0.75 is chosen as a point significantly below the baseline 1.0, indicating a clear failure of collective cooperation. The "last few rounds" lookback allows for some recovery after a single negative round.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative and optimistic approach is to initiate cooperation. This is a common and often effective starting point in repeated games. It signals a willingness to cooperate and provides an opportunity for others to reciprocate.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In a finite repeated game, the last round often exhibits a "shading into the end" dynamic where players are incentivized to defect to maximize their individual payoff, as there are no future repercussions. By defecting, we ensure we don't get exploited in the final round if others choose to defect. This is a rational response given the finite horizon.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative in its intent:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** By always cooperating in the first round, it sets a positive tone and aims to foster an environment where cooperation can emerge.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** The condition for cooperating (high average payoff) directly rewards the collective effort of cooperators.
*   **Punishes Defection (with forgiveness):** It punishes a lack of collective cooperation by defecting, but not excessively. The forgiveness mechanism allows for recovery and doesn't immediately lead to a permanent defection spiral, which is crucial for re-establishing cooperation.
*   **Aligns with Cooperative Mindset:** The strategy's core logic is to maintain cooperation as long as it is mutually beneficial (indicated by high average payoffs) and only to defect when such benefits are clearly absent.

This strategy is designed to be a strong cooperative player that can adapt to the environment. It prioritizes cooperation, but understands the rational incentives in a finite game and the need to respond to widespread defection, albeit with a forgiving touch.

description_COOPERATIVE_116 = '''
This strategy aims to foster cooperation in the Public Goods Game by rewarding cooperation and punishing defection, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances. It's designed to be robust and promote the highest possible cumulative payoff for all players in the long run, while also securing a reasonable individual payoff.

## Strategy Name: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness (ATFT-F)

**Core Principle:** Start cooperatively, reciprocate the previous round's average action, and occasionally forgive defections to prevent complete breakdown of cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round *t* (for *t* > 1) depends on the observed behavior of other players in round *t-1*.

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   The *average* action of all players in the previous round (t-1) was cooperative or neutral. Specifically, if the proportion of cooperators in round *t-1* was greater than or equal to **(k/n) + ε**, where ε is a small positive value (e.g., 0.05) representing a buffer zone. This means if the collective action was sufficient to make cooperation at least as good as defecting for an individual (given the k/n multiplier), we encourage it.
    *   Or, if we have recently encountered a period of widespread defection, and the number of cooperators in the previous round was above a certain threshold (even if below the primary threshold), we attempt to "re-initiate" cooperation. This is a key aspect of forgiveness.

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   The *average* action of all players in the previous round (t-1) was predominantly defecting. Specifically, if the proportion of cooperators in round *t-1* was less than **(k/n) + ε**. This indicates that collective defection is more beneficial for the group, and we signal dissatisfaction.

**Detailed Breakdown of the "Average Action" and Forgiveness:**

To implement the "average action" and forgiveness, we will maintain a running track of the **"Cooperation Index" (CI)**.

*   **Cooperation Index (CI):** This will be a value between 0 and 1 representing the perceived level of cooperation in the group.
    *   Initialize CI to 0 before round 1.
    *   After each round *t*, update CI based on the proportion of cooperators in round *t*. Let `num_cooperators_t` be the number of players who played C in round *t*.
    *   The proportion of cooperators in round *t* is `proportion_cooperators_t = num_cooperators_t / n`.
    *   The update rule for CI will be a smoothed average, for example, using an exponential moving average:
        `CI_t = α * proportion_cooperators_t + (1 - α) * CI_{t-1}`
        where `α` (alpha) is a smoothing factor (e.g., 0.2). This prevents the CI from jumping too drastically based on a single round's outcome.

**Decision Rules based on CI:**

*   **In round *t* (t > 1):**
    *   **Play C if:** `CI_{t-1} >= (k/n) + ε` OR (a forgiveness condition is met).
    *   **Play D if:** `CI_{t-1} < (k/n) + ε` AND (no forgiveness condition is met).

**Forgiveness Condition:**

This condition allows the strategy to recover from prolonged periods of defection.
*   **Forgiveness Triggered:** If the `CI` has been below `(k/n) + ε` for a certain number of consecutive rounds (let's call this `forgiveness_threshold`, e.g., 3 rounds), AND the current proportion of cooperators in the previous round (`proportion_cooperators_{t-1}`) is above a minimal threshold (e.g., `1/n`, meaning at least one person cooperated).
*   **Forgiveness Action:** If the forgiveness is triggered, and the current `proportion_cooperators_{t-1}` is above a certain minimum (e.g., 10% of players cooperated in the previous round), the strategy will attempt to cooperate (play C) even if the `CI` is still low. This is an attempt to break a negative cycle. A small "loyalty" counter can track consecutive defections by the group. If this counter exceeds a certain value, we check the forgiveness condition.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is a "generous" start. It signals a willingness to cooperate and can incentivize others to do the same. It also establishes a baseline for reciprocal behavior.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence. Any cooperation in this round is pure altruism. To maximize individual payoff in this isolated round, defection is the dominant strategy from a purely selfish perspective. By defecting, we ensure we don't get exploited and secure our private endowment.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy begins by cooperating, setting a cooperative tone.
*   **Reciprocity:** It directly reciprocates the group's average behavior. If the group cooperates, we cooperate. If the group defects, we defect to signal dissatisfaction.
*   **Forgiveness Mechanism:** The inclusion of a forgiveness mechanism is crucial for long-term cooperation. It prevents the game from devolving into complete defection due to a few rounds of bad behavior. This adaptive element allows the group to potentially re-establish cooperation after periods of conflict.
*   **Threshold for Cooperation:** The condition `CI_{t-1} >= (k/n) + ε` is a key cooperative element. It defines a "sweet spot" where collective cooperation benefits everyone. We aim to maintain or return to this state. The small buffer `ε` ensures that we don't immediately punish minor dips in cooperation.

This cooperative strategy aims to maximize the total payoff for all players by fostering cooperation, while also being resilient to defection and adapting to changing game dynamics. It's designed to be a good default strategy that encourages cooperation without being overly naive.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness"

This strategy combines the simplicity and effectiveness of Tit-for-Tat with a mechanism for recovering from periods of defection, aiming to re-establish cooperation when possible.

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of the strategy is to reciprocate the *previous round's average cooperation level*. This means that if other players were generally cooperative in the last round, the strategy will lean towards cooperation in the current round, and vice-versa.

**In Round t (where t > 1):**

*   **Calculate the average cooperation rate from the previous round (t-1):**
    Let $C_{t-1}$ be the total number of players who played Cooperate in round $t-1$.
    The average cooperation rate in round $t-1$ is: $AvgCoop_{t-1} = C_{t-1} / n$.

*   **Determine the threshold for cooperation in round t:**
    The strategy will cooperate if the average cooperation rate in the previous round meets or exceeds a certain threshold. This threshold represents a balance between rewarding cooperation and not being exploited by consistent defectors. A reasonable starting point for this threshold would be slightly above the "minimum viable cooperation" to sustain a positive payoff for cooperators.

    **Decision Rule:**
    *   **If $AvgCoop_{t-1} \ge \tau$**: Play **C** (Cooperate).
    *   **If $AvgCoop_{t-1} < \tau$**: Play **D** (Defect).

    **Determining the Threshold ($\tau$):**
    The threshold $\tau$ should be set based on the game parameters to ensure that cooperation is mutually beneficial.
    Consider the payoff for a cooperator when the total number of cooperators is $C$. The payoff is $(k/n) \times C$. For this to be at least 1 (the payoff for defecting), we need $(k/n) \times C \ge 1$, which means $C \ge n/k$.
    Since $k < n$, $n/k > 1$. This indicates that for a cooperator to get a better payoff than defecting, *more than $n/k$ players must cooperate*.

    Therefore, a sensible threshold $\tau$ should be set such that if the average cooperation rate is below this, defecting becomes a more rational individual choice for the strategy.

    **Proposed Threshold ($\tau$):**
    $\tau = \max(0.5, 1/k)$

    *   **Why $\max(0.5, 1/k)$?**
        *   **$1/k$:** This captures the critical cooperation rate needed for cooperators to break even or profit relative to their endowment. If $k$ is high, $1/k$ is low, meaning less cooperation is needed to make cooperation worthwhile. If $k$ is low (close to 1), $1/k$ is high, demanding more cooperation.
        *   **$0.5$:** This acts as a baseline. Even if $1/k$ is very low (e.g., $k$ is large, approaching $n$), we still require at least 50% average cooperation to trigger our own cooperation. This prevents the strategy from being overly sensitive to small deviations in cooperation when the public good is generally not strong enough to overcome individual incentives.

    **The "Forgiveness" Aspect:**
    The adaptive nature of this strategy comes from its reliance on the *average* cooperation rate of *all* players. If a few players defect while most cooperate, the average might still be high enough to trigger cooperation. Conversely, if many players defect, the average will drop, triggering defection. This is a form of forgiveness because it doesn't punish a single defector; it reacts to the collective behavior.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    In the absence of any historical data, the strategy should make a default choice that balances the desire for cooperation with caution.
    **Decision Rule for Round 1:** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** Starting with cooperation signals a cooperative intent and gives the other players an opportunity to reciprocate. It's the most direct way to try and establish a cooperative norm from the outset. If the game parameters suggest that full cooperation is highly beneficial (e.g., $k$ is large), this initial cooperative move is crucial.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. This is known as the "end-game problem" or "unraveling" in repeated games. Rational players will defect in the last round because there's no penalty for doing so in future rounds.
    **Decision Rule for Last Round (t = r):** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** To avoid being exploited in the final round, the strategy defects. This acknowledges the rational self-interest that emerges when future interactions are absent.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is inherently cooperative in its design for rounds $1 < t < r$.

*   **Default to Cooperation:** The default action for most of the game is cooperation, contingent on observed collective cooperation.
*   **Rewarding Cooperation:** It actively rewards past cooperation by continuing to cooperate when the average cooperation rate is above the threshold.
*   **Adaptive and Resilient:** It doesn't blindly cooperate. It adapts based on observed behavior. If other players consistently defect, this strategy will eventually defect as well, protecting its own payoff. However, it retains the capacity to return to cooperation if the collective behavior shifts back.
*   **Focus on Collective Outcome:** By calculating the *average* cooperation rate of *all* players, the strategy prioritizes the collective outcome. It's less about punishing individuals and more about reacting to the overall game state.

This strategy provides a robust and cooperative approach to the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to incentivize and maintain cooperation while adapting to the actions of other players.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_118 = '''
This is a fascinating challenge! Designing a cooperative strategy for a repeated Public Goods Game, especially in a tournament setting where opponent behavior is unknown and potentially adversarial, requires a delicate balance between encouraging cooperation and protecting oneself from exploitation.

Here's a proposed cooperative strategy, which I'll call **"Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness" (ATF)**:

The core idea is to be initially cooperative, reward continued cooperation, and punish defection, but with a mechanism to "forgive" and re-establish cooperation after a period of mutual defection. This strategy is designed to be robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors by learning and adapting.

## Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness (ATF)

**1. Decision Rules:**

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` will depend on the observed behavior of **all other players** in the previous round `t-1`.

*   **Default Behavior: Cooperate (C)**
    *   In the absence of evidence that defection is beneficial or necessary, the default action is to cooperate. This aligns with the cooperative mindset and aims to foster mutual cooperation.

*   **Response to Universal Cooperation:**
    *   If all players (including yourself) cooperated in the previous round, continue to **Cooperate (C)**. This reinforces successful cooperation.

*   **Response to Partial Cooperation (Some Cooperators, Some Defectors):**
    *   If there were *some* cooperators and *some* defectors in the previous round, but not *all* players defected:
        *   **Continue to Cooperate (C)**. This strategy is forgiving. It assumes that the presence of cooperators indicates a potential for stable cooperation and that a single defector might be an anomaly or an attempt to test boundaries.

*   **Response to Universal Defection (All Players Defected):**
    *   If *all* players (including yourself) defected in the previous round:
        *   **Defect (D)** in the current round. This is a punitive measure to signal that universal defection is not sustainable or desirable.
        *   **However, after a *threshold* number of consecutive universal defections, the strategy will conditionally switch back to Cooperate (C)**. This is the "forgiveness" mechanism. The threshold is not fixed but will be adaptively determined.

*   **Adaptive Forgiveness Threshold:**
    *   The strategy will maintain a "forgiveness counter" for universal defection.
    *   When universal defection occurs, increment the forgiveness counter.
    *   When cooperation (even partial) occurs, reset the forgiveness counter to 0.
    *   The decision to switch back to **Cooperate (C)** after universal defection will be triggered when the forgiveness counter reaches a dynamic threshold. This threshold will be:
        *   **Proportionate to the game's parameters (n, k):** A higher `k/n` ratio makes cooperation more appealing. If `k/n` is close to 1 (e.g., `k=n-1`), universal defection is very punishing for cooperators. In such cases, the forgiveness threshold should be lower, encouraging a quicker return to cooperation. If `k/n` is close to 1 (e.g., `k=1.1` for `n=6`), the incentive to defect is strong, and the forgiveness threshold should be higher.
        *   **A function of the *number of rounds played* (t):** In early rounds, players might be exploring. In later rounds, established patterns are more likely. The threshold could increase slightly as `r` approaches completion.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Always **Cooperate (C)**. In the absence of any history, the most cooperative and optimistic action is to initiate cooperation. This sets a positive tone.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   Always **Defect (D)**. In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. Defection guarantees a private payoff of 1, whereas cooperation guarantees a payoff of `(k/n) * total_contributions`. Since `k < n`, `k/n < 1`, so the share of public good is less than 1 per player. Therefore, in the last round, maximizing individual payoff means defecting. This is a common and rational strategy in the final round of finitely repeated games.

*   **No History (Very Early Rounds):**
    *   The strategy will rely on the observed actions of *all other players*. If there isn't enough data to establish a clear pattern of universal defection or cooperation, the default **Cooperate (C)** action will prevail, unless there's clear evidence of exploitation.

**3. Being Cooperative:**

*   **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by cooperating, signaling a desire for mutual benefit.
*   **Reward Cooperation:** It consistently rewards observed cooperation from others by continuing to cooperate.
*   **Punish Defection (but with limits):** It punishes universal defection to discourage free-riding, but this punishment is not indefinite. The adaptive forgiveness mechanism allows for a return to cooperation, recognizing that sustained mutual defection leads to suboptimal outcomes for everyone.
*   **Maximizing Joint Payoff (Indirectly):** By aiming for sustained mutual cooperation, this strategy implicitly seeks to maximize the sum of payoffs across all players, as the total payoff when everyone cooperates (`n * 2`) is higher than when everyone defects (`n * 1`).

num_rounds_played = 0
last_round_actions = [] # List of actions (C/D) of all players in the previous round

def calculate_initial_forgiveness_threshold(n, k, r):
    # This is a placeholder. A good heuristic could be:

    # Or simpler:
    return max(2, int(r / 3)) # Forgive after 1/3 of remaining rounds approximately

def decide_action(player_id, history):
    global num_rounds_played

        return "C"

    # 3. Analyze Last Round's Actions (if available)
    if not last_round_actions:
        # Should not happen after first round, but as a fallback
        return "C"

    all_defected = all(action == "D" for action in last_round_actions)
    all_cooperated = all(action == "C" for action in last_round_actions)
    num_cooperators = last_round_actions.count("C")

    # Update counters based on last round's outcome
    if all_defected:
        num_consecutive_universal_defects += 1
    else:
        num_consecutive_universal_defects = 0 # Reset if not universal defection

    # Adapt forgiveness threshold (example heuristic)
    # This could be more sophisticated, e.g., based on the *rate* of defection
    # or the deviation from expected cooperation.
    dynamic_forgiveness_threshold = max(2, int(r * (1 - (k/n)) / 2) + num_consecutive_universal_defects) # Example: more forgiving if k/n low, and threshold increases with history

    # Decision Logic
    if all_defected:
        if num_consecutive_universal_defects >= dynamic_forgiveness_threshold:
            # Time to forgive and try cooperation again
            return "C"
        else:
            # Continue punishing universal defection
            return "D"
    elif all_cooperated:
        # All players cooperated, reinforce this
        return "C"
    else:
        # Some cooperated, some defected. Be optimistic and continue cooperating.
        # This is the "forgiving" part for partial cooperation.
        return "C"

    # Update for next round
    # In a real implementation, last_round_actions would be set externally
    # after the round's outcomes are known.
```

**Explanation of Adaptive Forgiveness Threshold:**

The `dynamic_forgiveness_threshold` is key to the "adaptive" nature.

*   **`max(2, ...)`:** Ensures we always have at least a short period of punishment (2 rounds) before considering forgiveness, preventing immediate abandonment of punishment if a single defection occurs.
*   **`r * (1 - (k/n)) / 2`:**
    *   `k/n` is the crucial parameter indicating the efficiency of the public good. If `k/n` is close to 1, the public good is highly efficient, and defecting is very tempting. In this case, `1 - (k/n)` is small, making the threshold lower, meaning it's more willing to forgive and return to cooperation.
    *   If `k/n` is small (e.g., `k=2, n=6`, `k/n = 1/3`), the public good is inefficient. `1 - (k/n)` is larger, and the threshold is higher, meaning it will endure longer in universal defection before forgiving.
    *   Dividing by 2 is an arbitrary factor to tune the sensitivity.
*   **`+ num_consecutive_universal_defects`:** This part dynamically *increases* the threshold as universal defection persists. If we've already been in a state of universal defection for a while, it suggests that immediate forgiveness might be premature. This makes the strategy more resilient to prolonged cycles of mutual defection before attempting to break out.

This strategy aims to be a strong cooperative player that can recover from cycles of defection by intelligently re-initiating cooperation, making it robust against a variety of opponents without explicit knowledge of their strategies.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_119 = '''
This is a fascinating challenge! Designing a purely cooperative strategy in a repeated public goods game with no communication, where defection is individually rational in a single round, requires careful consideration of how to incentivize cooperation over time. Given the constraints, my strategy will focus on building trust through conditional cooperation and punishing deviations, while always aiming to return to cooperation if possible.

Here's my proposed cooperative strategy:

## Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness and Parameter Awareness (TFPA)

**Core Philosophy:** Be cooperative as long as the group remains cooperative, but retaliate against defection to protect the collective good. Crucially, incorporate an understanding of the game parameters to guide adaptive behavior.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect hinges on the observed behavior of other players in the previous round, mediated by the game's parameters.

*   **Default State: Cooperate (C)**
    *   **Initial Round:** Always Cooperate (C). This establishes an immediate cooperative signal.
    *   **Subsequent Rounds:** Cooperate (C) if, in the **previous round (t-1)**, **a sufficient number of other players cooperated**.

*   **When to Defect (D):**
    *   **Retaliation for Defection:** Defect (D) if, in the **previous round (t-1)**, **a significant number of other players defected**. The "significant number" is determined by the game parameters.

*   **The "Sufficient" and "Significant" Thresholds:**
    *   Let $N_C(t-1)$ be the number of players who cooperated in round $t-1$.
    *   Let $N_D(t-1)$ be the number of players who defected in round $t-1$.
    *   My decision in round $t$ will be:
        *   **Cooperate (C) if:** $N_C(t-1) \geq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ (i.e., if at least half the players cooperated in the previous round).
        *   **Defect (D) if:** $N_D(t-1) \geq \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ (i.e., if at least half the players defected in the previous round).
        *   **Special Case (Tie-breaking / Forgiveness):** If $N_C(t-1) = N_D(t-1) = n/2$ (only possible if $n$ is even), I will default to cooperating (C). This represents a preference for rebuilding cooperation.

*   **Rationale for Thresholds:**
    *   Using a threshold of $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ for cooperation ensures that I require a substantial portion of the group to have cooperated to continue cooperating myself. This prevents me from being exploited by a minority of defectors.
    *   Using a threshold of $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ for defection means I will defect if the group has clearly tipped towards defection. This acts as a deterrent.
    *   The tie-breaking rule of defaulting to cooperation when the split is even aims to facilitate the re-establishment of cooperation if the group is on the fence.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Always Cooperate (C).** This is the initial signal of good faith and a commitment to the cooperative ideal. It's the only sensible starting point in a repeated game without prior history.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** This is a crucial adaptation based on the knowledge that there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. In the final round, the game collapses to a single-shot prisoner's dilemma-like scenario for each player. My individual payoff maximization in this last round necessitates defecting, as there's no future consequence for this action. This is a standard element in the analysis of finite repeated games.

*   **Rounds between the first and last (1 < t < r):**
    *   Apply the decision rules outlined in section 1. This is where the adaptive, history-dependent behavior comes into play.

---

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative, but with a pragmatic approach to self-preservation and the preservation of the collective good.

*   **Initial Cooperative Stance:** It starts with a strong cooperative signal in the first round.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the group exhibits a sufficient level of cooperation. This is the essence of reciprocity.
*   **Deterrence and Punishment:** It punishes widespread defection by defecting itself. This is not malicious but a strategic move to deter future exploitation and signal that sustained defection will lead to the breakdown of cooperation for all.
*   **Forgiveness/Rebuilding:** The tie-breaking rule when counts are even aims to provide an opportunity for the group to return to cooperation, rather than remaining locked in a cycle of mutual defection.
*   **Parameter Awareness:** The thresholds for cooperation and defection are derived directly from the number of players ($n$), reflecting an understanding of the group size and the game's structure. While not directly using $k$, the strategy implicitly understands that a higher $k$ would make cooperation more beneficial for the group, and thus this strategy aims to maintain cooperation to realize those benefits.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
Strategy TFPA(current_round, total_rounds, num_players, k, my_history, all_players_history)

  // all_players_history is a list of lists, where each inner list contains
  // the actions of all players in a given round.
  // my_history contains my actions.

  // Handle the last round: Always defect
  if current_round == total_rounds:
    return "D"

  // Handle the first round: Always cooperate
  if current_round == 1:
    return "C"

  // For all other rounds (2 to r-1): Use history
  previous_round = current_round - 1
  num_cooperators_prev = 0
  num_defectors_prev = 0

  // Get actions from the previous round
  if previous_round > 0: // Ensure there's history to check
      actions_in_previous_round = all_players_history[previous_round] // Assuming 0-indexed history
      for player_action in actions_in_previous_round:
          if player_action == "C":
              num_cooperators_prev += 1
          else:
              num_defectors_prev += 1
  else:
      // This case should ideally not be reached for rounds > 1,
      // but as a fallback, assume no prior cooperation if history is unexpectedly missing.
      // Or, more robustly, this implies we are in round 2, and the previous round was round 1
      // where we know everyone cooperated (as per rule for round 1).
      // Let's assume the history is correctly populated for all_players_history[1]
      pass // If in round 2, we use the history of round 1.

  // Decision rules based on previous round's cooperation
  cooperation_threshold = floor(num_players / 2)
  defection_threshold = ceil(num_players / 2)

  if num_cooperators_prev >= cooperation_threshold:
    // Sufficient cooperation in the previous round, continue cooperating
    return "C"
  else if num_defectors_prev >= defection_threshold:
    // Too many defections in the previous round, retaliate
    return "D"
  else:
    // Tie-breaking case or unexpected count: Default to cooperation to encourage rebuilding
    // This covers num_cooperators_prev < cooperation_threshold AND num_defectors_prev < defection_threshold
    // which can happen if num_cooperators_prev == num_defectors_prev == num_players / 2 (if n is even).
    return "C"

```

This strategy aims to be robust by:
1.  **Establishing Cooperation:** The initial "C" sets a positive tone.
2.  **Reciprocity:** It rewards cooperation by cooperating back.
3.  **Deterrence:** It punishes widespread defection to prevent it from becoming the norm.
4.  **Adaptability:** It adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of others.
5.  **End-Game Awareness:** It correctly identifies the rational defection in the final round.
6.  **Parameter Influence:** While not directly using $k$ in the decision logic (as per standard strategies in iterated games), the thresholds are derived from $n$, showing an awareness of the game's fundamental structure. The implicit goal is to achieve payoffs closer to the "all C" scenario, which is more beneficial when $k > 1$.

This strategy is purely based on observable actions and game parameters, aligning with the requirements of the tournament.

## Cooperative Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by rewarding mutual contribution and punishing defection, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to a changing environment. It is designed to be robust, resilient, and to align with a cooperative mindset.

**Core Principle:** We aim for mutual cooperation (everyone playing C) as this yields the highest collective payoff (2 per player in the example) and a good individual payoff (2). We will only defect when it's necessary to defend our accumulated gains or when cooperation has clearly failed.

### 1. Decision Rules

Our decision rule is based on the observed behavior of the group in the previous round and the overall history of cooperation.

**General Rule:** In any given round (except the first and last), we will play **C (Cooperate)** if the proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round was **greater than or equal to** a defined cooperation threshold, and **D (Defect)** otherwise.

**Cooperation Threshold:** This threshold is a crucial parameter that balances the desire for cooperation with the need to protect oneself from exploitation. It will be dynamically adjusted.

**Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **Initial Threshold:** Start with a moderate threshold, for example, `threshold = n / 2.0`. This means we require at least half the players to have cooperated in the previous round to continue cooperating ourselves.
*   **Increasing the Threshold (Encouraging More Cooperation):** If we observe a sustained period of high cooperation (e.g., the proportion of cooperators has been above `threshold + 0.2` for the last `r/3` rounds, or a significant majority), we can slightly **increase** our threshold (e.g., `threshold = min(n, threshold + 0.1)`). This shows we are willing to be more trusting and encourage even higher levels of cooperation.
*   **Decreasing the Threshold (Responding to Defection):** If we observe a significant drop in cooperation (e.g., the proportion of cooperators falls below `threshold - 0.2`), we will slightly **decrease** our threshold (e.g., `threshold = max(0.1, threshold - 0.1)`). This signifies that we are becoming more cautious due to observed defection patterns.
*   **Steep Decrease (Punishment Trigger):** If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round is significantly below our current threshold (e.g., less than `threshold - 0.3` *and* less than `n/2.0`), we will trigger a **"punishment" phase** for a few rounds.

**Punishment Phase:**

During a punishment phase, our strategy will be more aggressive in defecting. We will play **D (Defect)** for a fixed number of rounds (e.g., `punishment_duration = 3` rounds). This serves as a strong signal that exploitation will not be tolerated. After the punishment phase, we will revert to the general rule, but with a potentially lowered threshold.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Decision:** Play **C (Cooperate)**. This is our initial cooperative gesture. We assume that others will also try to cooperate initially, and this is the best way to set the stage for mutual benefit. The history is empty, so we must start with an assumption of goodwill.
    *   **Threshold:** Initialize `threshold = n / 2.0`.

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Decision:** Play **D (Defect)**. In the absence of future rounds, the incentive to cooperate disappears. The payoff from defecting is always higher in the final round, regardless of what others do, as there are no future consequences. This is the standard Nash Equilibrium for a single-round game, and it applies here as the final round.

*   **Sustained Low Cooperation:** If at any point, the observed proportion of cooperators in the previous round is consistently very low (e.g., below `0.2` for multiple consecutive rounds) and our threshold has been lowered significantly, we might consider a prolonged period of defection until we see a clear sign of renewed cooperation. However, the punishment phase is designed to handle most of this.

### 3. Being Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Initial Cooperative Stance:** We always start by cooperating. This is a clear signal of our intent to build a cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Reward for Cooperation:** We continue to cooperate as long as there's a reasonable level of cooperation from others. Our threshold is designed to maintain cooperation if it's present, even if it's not perfect.
*   **Adaptive Cooperation:** The dynamic adjustment of the threshold allows us to be more trusting when the environment is conducive to cooperation and more cautious when it's not. This "conditional cooperation" is a hallmark of robust cooperative strategies.
*   **Punishment as a Deterrent:** The punishment phase is not malicious; it's a mechanism to deter free-riding. By defecting when exploitation is evident, we aim to bring the group back towards a more cooperative state by signaling that such behavior has consequences. This is a form of reciprocal altruism, where cooperation is contingent on the observed behavior of others.
*   **Maximizing Collective Payoff:** Our ultimate goal is to achieve the highest possible payoff for everyone, which occurs when all players cooperate. Our strategy is geared towards facilitating and maintaining this state.

This strategy is designed to encourage cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game while being resilient to defections. It leverages the repeated nature of the game to punish and reward past behavior, aiming to achieve a collectively beneficial outcome.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Reciprocity with Forgiveness"

This strategy is based on the principle of reciprocity: cooperate if others cooperate, and defect if they defect. However, it includes an element of forgiveness to prevent the game from devolving into perpetual defection due to a single mistake.

### 1. Decision Rules

**Primary Decision Rule:**

*   **If, in the previous round, the proportion of players who cooperated was greater than or equal to a "cooperation threshold" (θ), then cooperate (play C).**
*   **Otherwise (if the proportion of cooperators was less than θ), then defect (play D).**

**Defining the Cooperation Threshold (θ):**

The cooperation threshold is crucial for balancing the desire for cooperation with the need to respond to widespread defection. A good starting point, based on the game parameters, is:

*   **θ = k**

*Why k?* The parameter 'k' represents the multiplier for contributions. If 'k' or more players cooperate, the average payoff for cooperation is at least equal to the payoff from defection (when everyone else cooperates). If fewer than 'k' players cooperate, the return on collective investment is diminished, making individual defection more appealing. Setting the threshold at 'k' aims to maintain a level of contribution where cooperation is self-sustaining or beneficial for the group.

**Adjustment Mechanism (Adaptive Element):**

While the primary rule is based on a fixed threshold 'k', the strategy can be made more adaptive. We can introduce a dynamic adjustment to the threshold based on observed outcomes.

*   **If the average payoff in the previous round was significantly lower than what could be achieved with full cooperation (i.e., 2), we might slightly increase the threshold for cooperation in the current round.** This makes us more hesitant to cooperate if the group has consistently underperformed.
*   **Conversely, if the average payoff was high and close to the potential full cooperation payoff, we might slightly decrease the threshold.** This encourages continued cooperation even if the threshold isn't perfectly met.

However, for simplicity and robustness in a tournament setting where precise parameter tuning is difficult beforehand, we will stick to the **fixed threshold θ = k** for the core logic. The adaptive element can be considered a more advanced refinement.

**Specific Decision for Player i:**

For player `i` in round `t`:

1.  **Calculate the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1`**:
    `proportion_cooperators_t_minus_1 = (Σ(j=1 to n) c_j,t_minus_1) / n`
2.  **If `proportion_cooperators_t_minus_1 >= k`**:
    Play C.
3.  **Else**:
    Play D.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**First Round (t=1):**

*   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the absence of any history, the most cooperative and optimistic approach is to initiate cooperation. This sets a positive example and allows the strategy to test the waters. It also aligns with the "cooperative mindset." If all players start with defection, the game immediately settles into a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium.

**Last Round (t=r):**

*   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. Any cooperation in the last round does not influence future payoffs or behavior. Therefore, from a purely self-interested perspective in the last round, defecting is the dominant strategy, as it maximizes one's own immediate payoff regardless of others' actions. This is a standard outcome in finite repeated games.

**General Round (1 < t < r):**

*   Apply the **Primary Decision Rule** based on the proportion of cooperators in the *previous* round (`t-1`).

**What if the threshold `k` is not an integer?**

The threshold `k` is given as `1 < k < n`. When comparing the proportion of cooperators (which is a float) to `k`, we directly use the float comparison. The proportion of cooperators is `(number of cooperators) / n`.

**Example with `k=2.5` and `n=6`:**

*   If 3 players cooperated: Proportion = 3/6 = 0.5. If `k=2.5`, then `0.5 < 2.5`, so defect.
*   If 4 players cooperated: Proportion = 4/6 = 0.66. If `k=2.5`, then `0.66 < 2.5`, so defect.
*   *Wait, this seems wrong with the proportion.* Let's re-evaluate the threshold logic carefully.

**Revisiting the Threshold Logic with Integer Contributions:**

The parameter `k` is a *multiplication factor*. The payoff formula is `π_i = (1 - c_i) + (k/n) × Σ(j=1 to n) c_j`.

Player `i`'s payoff from cooperating is `0 + (k/n) * TotalCooperators`.
Player `i`'s payoff from defecting is `1 + (k/n) * TotalCooperators`.

Cooperation is individually rational *if* `(k/n) * TotalCooperators > 1`. This means `TotalCooperators > n/k`.

Let `C_t` be the total number of cooperators in round `t`.
Player `i` prefers to cooperate in round `t` if:
`0 + (k/n) * C_t >= 1 + (k/n) * C_t`  -- This is always false, implying cooperation is never *strictly* dominant if others' actions are fixed.

Let's look at it from the perspective of the *group*.
The *total* payoff in the group is `Σ(i=1 to n) π_i = Σ(i=1 to n) [(1 - c_i) + (k/n) Σ(j=1 to n) c_j]`.
This simplifies to `Σ(i=1 to n) (1 - c_i) + n * (k/n) Σ(j=1 to n) c_j`.
`= (n - TotalCooperators) + k * TotalCooperators`.
`= n + (k-1) * TotalCooperators`.

Since `k > 1`, the total group payoff increases with the number of cooperators. The group as a whole is better off when more people cooperate.

**Individual Incentive Check:**

Consider player `i`.
If player `i` cooperates: payoff is `(k/n) * TotalCooperators_including_i`
If player `i` defects: payoff is `1 + (k/n) * TotalCooperators_excluding_i`

Let `C_prev` be the number of cooperators in the previous round.
Our strategy says: Cooperate if `C_prev >= k`.

Let's test this against the individual incentive:
If `C_prev >= k`, we play C. What is our payoff in round `t`?
Suppose `C_prev` leads us to play C in round `t`.
If we cooperate in round `t`, our payoff is `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1)`.
If we defect in round `t` (even though our rule said C), our payoff is `1 + (k/n) * C_prev`.

We prefer to cooperate if:
`(k/n) * (C_prev + 1) >= 1 + (k/n) * C_prev`
`(k/n) * C_prev + k/n >= 1 + (k/n) * C_prev`
`k/n >= 1`
`k >= n`

This contradicts the game specification `k < n`. This means that *if everyone else's actions are fixed*, defecting is always individually rational (the "temptation to defect").

**The strategy must be about influencing *future* behavior through reciprocity, not about finding a strictly dominant strategy in a single round.**

The threshold `k` is best understood as the *minimum number of cooperators required for the strategy to continue cooperating*. If fewer than `k` people cooperated last round, we will punish by defecting, hoping to incentivize them to cooperate next round.

**Revised Decision Rule:**

*   **In round `t` (where `t > 1`):**
    *   Let `N_C(t-1)` be the number of players who cooperated in round `t-1`.
    *   **If `N_C(t-1) >= k`**, then player `i` plays **C**.
    *   **Else (if `N_C(t-1) < k`)**, then player `i` plays **D**.

*   **In round `t=1`:** Player `i` plays **C**.
*   **In round `t=r`:** Player `i` plays **D**.

This makes the strategy a form of "Grim Trigger" but with a softer punishment. Instead of defecting forever after one defection, it defects only if the group's cooperation falls below a critical level `k`. It's forgiving in that a single round of low cooperation doesn't permanently break cooperation; it just requires the group to meet the `k` threshold again.

**Addressing `k` not being an integer:**

If `k` is a float, the condition `N_C(t-1) >= k` directly compares the integer count of cooperators with the float `k`. This is a perfectly valid comparison.

*   Example: `n=6`, `k=2.5`.
    *   If 2 players cooperated: `2 < 2.5`, so defect.
    *   If 3 players cooperated: `3 >= 2.5`, so cooperate.

This interpretation aligns with the idea that a certain "critical mass" of cooperation is needed.

### 3. Be Cooperative

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative in spirit:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** It starts by being cooperative, offering the opportunity for mutual benefit.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as the group demonstrates a sufficient level of cooperation (meeting the `k` threshold).
*   **Punishes Defection (Softly):** It uses defection as a response to insufficient cooperation, but this punishment is temporary. It aims to steer the group back towards cooperation rather than simply retaliating.
*   **Optimizes for Group Outcome (Implicitly):** By setting a threshold `k` based on the game's multiplier, it implicitly aims for a scenario where collective action is beneficial. The strategy is designed to facilitate the emergence of a cooperative equilibrium if other players are also responsive to group outcomes.

### Pseudocode

```pseudocode
Strategy_ReciprocityWithForgiveness(game_parameters, history):
  n = game_parameters.n
  r = game_parameters.r
  k = game_parameters.k  // Cooperation threshold is set to k

  // Get the current round number from history (or pass as parameter)
  current_round = history.current_round

  // Initialize variables
  decision = D // Default to Defect

  // Handle the first round
  if current_round == 1:
    decision = C
  // Handle the last round
  else if current_round == r:
    decision = D
  // Handle intermediate rounds
  else:
    // Get the number of cooperators from the previous round
    previous_round_actions = history.actions_in_round[current_round - 1]
    num_cooperators_previous_round = count_of_C(previous_round_actions)

    // Apply the primary decision rule
    if num_cooperators_previous_round >= k:
      decision = C
    else:
      decision = D

  return decision

// Helper function (assuming history stores actions per player per round)
function count_of_C(actions_in_round):
  count = 0
  for each player_action in actions_in_round:
    if player_action == C:
      count = count + 1
  return count

```

This strategy is robust because it doesn't rely on any specific opponent behavior beyond observing their past actions. It can adapt to various dynamics:

*   **Always Defect opponents:** Will eventually lead our strategy to defect after round 1.
*   **Always Cooperate opponents:** Will lead our strategy to cooperate continuously (except the last round).
*   **Tit-for-Tat opponents:** Will be met with cooperation as long as they cooperate, and defection if they defect (but will restart cooperation if the opponent does).
*   **Complex strategies:** The strategy will react to the aggregate outcome of complex behaviors, aiming to maintain cooperation if the group achieves the threshold `k`.

The core idea is to create a stable feedback loop where sustained cooperation is rewarded, and significant lapses in cooperation are met with a temporary withdrawal of cooperation, giving the group a chance to recover.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_122 = '''
This N-Player Public Goods Game, with its parameters (n, r, k) and repeated nature, presents a fascinating challenge for designing a cooperative strategy. Given the constraints (no communication, perfect information, common knowledge), the strategy must be self-enforcing and rely on the history of play to encourage cooperation.

Here's a strategy designed to be cooperative, adaptive, and robust:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Cooperator with Grim Trigger"

This strategy is fundamentally cooperative, aiming for the highest collective payoff. It uses a modified "Grim Trigger" approach to punish defection and reward sustained cooperation. The adaptation comes from its ability to adjust to the observed behavior of other players.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of this strategy is to *initially cooperate* and continue to cooperate as long as the collective behavior of the group is cooperative. Defection is used as a mechanism to punish deviations from cooperation.

*   **Initial Action:** In the first round, play **C (Cooperate)**.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Condition for Cooperation:** If, in the *previous round (t-1)*, the *proportion of cooperators* was at least $\frac{k}{n}$, then play **C**.
    *   **Condition for Defection:** If, in the *previous round (t-1)*, the *proportion of cooperators* was *less than* $\frac{k}{n}$, then play **D (Defect)**.

**Rationale for the Threshold $\frac{k}{n}$:**

This threshold is crucial and derived from the game's payoff structure and the condition for a "Pareto Improvement" over universal defection.

*   **Universal Defection Payoff:** If everyone defects, each player gets 1. Total payoff is $n$.
*   **Universal Cooperation Payoff:** If everyone cooperates, each player gets $0 + (k/n) * n = k$. Total payoff is $nk$. Since $k > 1$, universal cooperation is better than universal defection for everyone.
*   **Individual Incentive to Defect:** A player will defect if their payoff from defecting is strictly greater than their payoff from cooperating, *given the actions of others*.
    *   If `N_C` is the number of cooperators in the previous round (excluding the player themselves):
        *   Payoff from Cooperating: $(k/n) * (N_C + 1)$
        *   Payoff from Defecting: $1 + (k/n) * N_C$
    *   A player will defect if $1 + (k/n) * N_C > (k/n) * (N_C + 1)$, which simplifies to $1 > k/n$. This is *always true* given the parameter constraint $k < n$. This means that in any single round, there's a temptation to defect if others are cooperating.
*   **Group Incentive to Cooperate:** The group as a whole benefits from cooperation as long as the total payoff from cooperation ($nk$) is greater than the total payoff from universal defection ($n$). This is true because $k > 1$.
*   **The $\frac{k}{n}$ Threshold's Role:** The $\frac{k}{n}$ threshold is chosen because it represents the *minimum proportion of cooperators required for the average payoff to be greater than or equal to the payoff from universal defection*.
    *   If the number of cooperators is $N_C$, the average payoff is $\frac{(1-c_i) + (k/n) \times N_C}{1} = \frac{0 + (k/n) \times N_C}{1} = (k/n) \times N_C$ if player i cooperated.
    *   If the average payoff is $\ge 1$, then cooperation is, on average, at least as good as universal defection for the group.
    *   Thus, if the proportion of cooperators $\frac{N_C}{n} \ge \frac{k}{n}$, then the average payoff is $\ge 1$.

This threshold acts as a dynamic indicator of whether the group's collective behavior is "efficient" enough to warrant continued cooperation. If the group falters and the cooperation level drops below this benchmark, it signals that the current level of cooperation is not sufficient to overcome individual incentives to defect, and the strategy shifts to punitive defection.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always play **C**. This establishes a cooperative baseline and signals a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial cooperation.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** The strategy *does not change* its behavior in the last round. It continues to apply the same decision rules.
    *   **Rationale:** While in a standard one-shot game, defection is always dominant, in a repeated game, the threat of future punishment (even if that future is just one more round) can sustain cooperation. By not changing behavior in the last round, the strategy maintains the integrity of the "Grim Trigger" element. If the group has cooperated up to the last round, the strategy continues to cooperate. If they've defected and triggered punishment, it continues to defect. This prevents a "last round effect" from unraveling cooperation prematurely.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Default to Cooperation:** It starts with cooperation and only deviates from it when the group's collective behavior falls below a threshold that is objectively beneficial for sustained group welfare (i.e., when the average payoff from cooperation is no longer demonstrably better than universal defection).
*   **Punishment is Proportionate:** The strategy punishes by defecting. However, this defection is conditional and temporary. It reverts to cooperation if the group returns to the cooperative threshold. It does not engage in endless cycles of mutual defection unless the opponent strategy forces it.
*   **Maximizing Joint Payoff:** By aiming for sustained cooperation (when $k/n \times N_C \ge 1$), the strategy seeks to maximize the total payoff for all players. The cooperative outcome ($N_C=n$) yields a total payoff of $nk$, which is the highest possible for the group.
*   **Adaptive to Observed Cooperation:** It doesn't rigidly demand perfect cooperation. It recognizes that minor deviations or temporary lapses in cooperation might occur and only reacts when the group's behavior is no longer collectively beneficial enough to justify continued selfless contribution.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Parameters: n, r, k
// History: actions_history = list of lists, where actions_history[t][i] is player i's action in round t
// Current round: t (1-indexed)

function decide_action(t, actions_history, player_index):
  // Initial Round
  if t == 1:
    return C

  // Calculate number of cooperators in the previous round
  num_cooperators_prev_round = 0
  for player_i in range(n):
    if actions_history[t-2][player_i] == C: // t-2 because history is 0-indexed for rounds
      num_cooperators_prev_round += 1

  // Calculate proportion of cooperators in the previous round
  proportion_cooperators_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round / n

  // Decision Rule
  cooperation_threshold = k / n

  if proportion_cooperators_prev_round >= cooperation_threshold:
    return C // Continue cooperating if the group was sufficiently cooperative
  else:
    return D // Defect if the group's cooperation level dropped below the threshold
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

*   `actions_history` would store the actions of all players in all preceding rounds. `actions_history[t-2]` refers to the actions taken in the round before the current one being decided (as the history is 0-indexed and rounds are 1-indexed).
*   The `player_index` is not actually used in this strategy as the decision is based purely on the aggregate history, making it a deterministic strategy for a given history.
*   The `cooperation_threshold` is calculated once.

This strategy offers a balanced approach: it's strongly biased towards cooperation, but possesses a clear, enforceable punishment mechanism that discourages free-riding and attempts to guide the group towards the collectively optimal outcome. Its adaptiveness lies in its response to the observed proportion of cooperators, making it resilient to various patterns of play from other AI agents.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_123 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptability and robustness:

## Cooperative Strategy: Adaptive Tit-for-Tat (ATFT)

This strategy aims to incentivize cooperation by mirroring the opponent's behavior, but with a degree of forgiveness and an initial push towards cooperation. It's designed to be adaptive to varying levels of cooperation and defection observed in past rounds.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Initiate Cooperation:** Start by cooperating to signal a willingness to engage in the public good.
2.  **Reciprocate:** Reward cooperation with cooperation and punish defection with defection.
3.  **Forgiveness:** Allow for occasional defection without immediately resorting to permanent defection, promoting a pathway back to cooperation.
4.  **Parameter Awareness:** Adapt the level of forgiveness and the threshold for switching to defection based on the game parameters ($k$ and $n$).

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round $t > 1$ will depend on the observed behavior of *all other players* in the previous round ($t-1$).

Let $N_C(t-1)$ be the number of players who cooperated in round $t-1$, and $N_D(t-1)$ be the number of players who defected in round $t-1$.

The strategy will maintain an internal "cooperation threshold," $\theta_t$. If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round is above this threshold, we will cooperate. Otherwise, we will defect.

**Decision Logic for Round $t > 1$:**

*   **If** $\frac{N_C(t-1)}{n-1} \ge \theta_{t-1}$: Player $i$ plays **C**.
*   **Else**: Player $i$ plays **D**.

The cooperation threshold $\theta_t$ will adapt based on the observed outcomes.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   Player $i$ plays **C**. This is the initial cooperative gesture.
    *   The initial cooperation threshold $\theta_1$ is set to 1.0 (meaning perfect cooperation from others is required to continue cooperating). This is a conservative starting point.

*   **Last Round ($r$):**
    *   The strategy's decision in the last round is the same as any other round: based on the observed behavior in round $r-1$ and the current cooperation threshold. There's no special "end-game" defection; the goal is to maximize the total payoff by maintaining cooperation as long as it's beneficial.

*   **Adaptation of the Cooperation Threshold ($\theta_t$):**
    The threshold $\theta_t$ is the crucial adaptive element. It will be adjusted based on how well cooperation has fared in the past.

    *   **If** player $i$ played **C** in round $t-1$ **AND** the number of cooperators in round $t-1$ ($N_C(t-1)$) was high (e.g., $\ge n/2$ or a parameter-dependent value):
        *   The threshold $\theta_t$ can slightly *decrease* (become more forgiving). This allows for a bit more flexibility. A possible update rule: $\theta_t = \max(0.5, \theta_{t-1} - \Delta_{decrease})$. The lower bound of 0.5 prevents complete abandonment of cooperation.

    *   **If** player $i$ played **C** in round $t-1$ **BUT** the number of cooperators in round $t-1$ was low (e.g., $< n/2$):
        *   The threshold $\theta_t$ remains the same or slightly *increases*. This signals that cooperation needs stronger support. A possible update rule: $\theta_t = \min(1.0, \theta_{t-1} + \Delta_{increase})$.

    *   **If** player $i$ played **D** in round $t-1$:
        *   The threshold $\theta_t$ significantly *increases*. This is a stronger signal that past cooperation was not sufficiently rewarded. A possible update rule: $\theta_t = \min(1.0, \theta_{t-1} + \Delta_{strong\_increase})$.

    **Proposed Threshold Update Logic (Simplified):**

    Let $C\_ratio_{t-1} = \frac{N_C(t-1)}{n-1}$ (proportion of others who cooperated).

    *   **Initial $\theta_1 = 1.0$**
    *   **For $t > 1$:**
        *   **If** player $i$ played **C** in round $t-1$:
            *   **If** $C\_ratio_{t-1} \ge 0.75$ (high cooperation): $\theta_t = \max(0.5, \theta_{t-1} - 0.05)$  *(Slightly more forgiving)*
            *   **Else** ($C\_ratio_{t-1} < 0.75$): $\theta_t = \min(1.0, \theta_{t-1} + 0.05)$ *(Slightly more demanding)*
        *   **Else** (player $i$ played **D** in round $t-1$):
            *   $\theta_t = \min(1.0, \theta_{t-1} + 0.15)$ *(Significantly more demanding)*

    **Parameter Integration:** The specific values for the thresholds and adjustment steps (0.05, 0.15, 0.75) can be fine-tuned, potentially with a slight bias towards higher thresholds when $k/n$ is lower (making cooperation less individually rewarding) and lower thresholds when $k/n$ is higher (making cooperation more attractive). For this initial design, we'll use fixed values and assume they are robust enough.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative:

*   **It initiates cooperation:** It doesn't start by defecting.
*   **It rewards cooperation:** It reciprocates cooperation, creating a positive feedback loop.
*   **It seeks to sustain cooperation:** The adaptive threshold aims to find a stable state of cooperation by adjusting expectations based on observed behavior. It doesn't aim for immediate exploitation of cooperators.
*   **It is not blindly cooperative:** It defects when cooperation is not reciprocated sufficiently, ensuring it doesn't become a "sucker" player.

### Pseudocode:

```
// Game Parameters: n (num_players), r (num_rounds), k (multiplier)

  // history is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a round
  // and contains 'actions': a list of player actions for that round (e.g., ['C', 'D', 'C', ...])

  if round_number == 1:
    return "C" // Always cooperate in the first round

  // Analyze previous round (t-1)
  previous_round_actions = history[round_number - 2]['actions'] // history is 0-indexed, round_number is 1-indexed
  num_cooperators_prev = count_cooperators(previous_round_actions)
  num_my_opponents = n - 1
  proportion_opponents_cooperated = num_cooperators_prev / num_my_opponents

  // Update cooperation threshold for the current round
  if my_last_action == "C":
    if proportion_opponents_cooperated >= 0.75:
      current_cooperation_threshold = max(0.5, current_cooperation_threshold - 0.05) // More forgiving
    else:

  count = 0
  for action in actions_list:
    if action == "C":
      count += 1
  return count

// Note: The history needs to be managed by the tournament engine.
// The 'actions' list in history would contain actions of ALL players including myself.
// When calculating proportion_opponents_cooperated, we need to exclude our own action from the previous round.
// The pseudocode above assumes history[round_number - 2]['actions'] contains ALL player actions for round t-1,
// and num_cooperators_prev is calculated based on ALL players.
// A slight modification is needed to correctly calculate proportion_opponents_cooperated based on OTHER players.

// Revised Calculation of proportion_opponents_cooperated for better accuracy:

function decide_action(round_number, history, player_index): // player_index is my index in the actions list
  // ... (rounds 1 logic remains the same)

  // Analyze previous round (t-1)
  previous_round_all_actions = history[round_number - 2]['actions'] // List of n actions for round t-1
  num_cooperators_prev_total = count_cooperators(previous_round_all_actions)
  my_action_prev_round = previous_round_all_actions[player_index]

  num_cooperators_others_prev = num_cooperators_prev_total
  if my_action_prev_round == "C":
      num_cooperators_others_prev -= 1 // Don't count myself if I cooperated
  
  num_my_opponents = n - 1
  proportion_opponents_cooperated = num_cooperators_others_prev / num_my_opponents

  // ... (threshold update logic remains the same, using my_action_prev_round as my_last_action)

  // Make decision for current round
  if proportion_opponents_cooperated >= current_cooperation_threshold:
    my_action = "C"
  else:
    my_action = "D"

  // Update for next round: my_last_action is correctly set to the decision made in THIS round
  my_last_action = my_action 
  return my_action
```

This strategy balances the desire for sustained cooperation with the need to protect itself from exploitation, making it a robust contender in a multi-agent environment.

description_COOPERATIVE_124 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with a Cooperative Threshold (AT4CT)

**Core Philosophy:**

The AT4CT strategy is rooted in the principle of reciprocity but tempered with a degree of forgiveness and a proactive cooperative leaning. It aims to foster cooperation by rewarding it, punishing defection, but also by making an initial gesture of trust and not retaliating too harshly to avoid being drawn into perpetual defection. The strategy is designed to be cooperative, meaning it aims to achieve the highest possible collective payoff, which generally occurs when all players cooperate.

**1. Decision Rules:**

The decision for player `i` in round `t` (where `t > 1`) is determined by the following:

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   In the previous round (`t-1`), the *average contribution rate* of all players (including oneself) was at or above a predefined **Cooperative Threshold (CT)**. The average contribution rate is calculated as: `(Total number of cooperators in round t-1) / n`.
    *   *AND* the player `i` did *not* experience a significant payoff drop in the previous round compared to what they would have received if all players had cooperated. This "payoff drop" is a mechanism to detect free-riding. A significant drop can be defined as a percentage of the maximum possible payoff from cooperating in the previous round.

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   In the previous round (`t-1`), the *average contribution rate* of all players was *below* the **Cooperative Threshold (CT)**.
    *   *OR* player `i` experienced a significant payoff drop in the previous round (indicating free-riding or a failure of the cooperative venture).

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   In the first round, there is no history. To initiate cooperation and signal trustworthiness, player `i` will **Cooperate (C)**. This is a crucial step to kickstart potential cooperation.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   The last round is a standard scenario in repeated games where the incentive to cooperate diminishes due to the absence of future repercussions. Therefore, in the last round (`t=r`), player `i` will **Defect (D)**. This is a prudent move to maximize individual payoff, as there is no future round to benefit from continued cooperation.

*   **Near the Last Round (e.g., t = r-1):**
    *   The strategy's default rules will apply. However, a slight adjustment can be made to be more cautious. If the current round is `r-1`, the player might be more inclined to defect if they observe any ambiguity or low average cooperation in the preceding rounds, anticipating the final round's defection. For simplicity in this initial design, we'll stick to the main rules, but this is a potential refinement.

**3. Being Cooperative:**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** The strategy starts by cooperating, giving other players the benefit of the doubt and the opportunity to reciprocate.
*   **Forgiving Mechanism:** The **Cooperative Threshold (CT)** is key to forgiveness. If cooperation dips slightly but not drastically, and the overall average is still reasonable, the strategy will continue to cooperate. This prevents a single defection from leading to an immediate cascade of mutual defection.
*   **Punishment for Free-riding:** The payoff drop detection mechanism is designed to punish clear instances of free-riding, where a player benefits from others' cooperation without contributing themselves. This ensures that persistent defectors are not rewarded.
*   **Goal Alignment:** The underlying goal of the AT4CT strategy is to maximize the *total* payoff for all players. It believes that this is best achieved through sustained cooperation. Defection is a tool used only when cooperation appears to be failing or being exploited.

**Parameters for AT4CT:**

*   **Cooperative Threshold (CT):** This is a critical parameter. A good starting point would be slightly above the "break-even" point for cooperation. For instance, if `k < n`, the total payoff when everyone cooperates (`n * 2`) is greater than when everyone defects (`n * 1`). The average payoff per player when everyone cooperates is `2`. A CT of, say, `0.6` or `0.7` (representing 60% or 70% of players cooperating) could be a good starting point. This means that if at least 60-70% of players cooperated in the previous round, the strategy is inclined to cooperate.
*   **Payoff Drop Threshold (PDT):** This defines what constitutes a "significant payoff drop." It can be a percentage of the payoff received when the player themselves cooperated in the previous round, or a percentage of the maximum possible payoff in a round. For example, if a player cooperated and their payoff dropped by more than 30% compared to what they would have received if everyone had cooperated, they might defect.

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
Strategy AT4CT(n, r, k, CT, PDT):

  // CT: Cooperative Threshold (e.g., 0.7)
  // PDT: Payoff Drop Threshold (e.g., 0.3)

  function decide_action(player_id, current_round, history):
    // history is a list of previous rounds' actions and payoffs for all players
    // history[t] = {actions: {player_id: action, ...}, payoffs: {player_id: payoff, ...}}

    if current_round == 1:
      return C // Cooperate in the first round

    if current_round == r:
      return D // Defect in the last round

    // Get information from the previous round (t-1)
    previous_round_data = history[current_round - 1]
    previous_actions = previous_round_data.actions
    previous_payoffs = previous_round_data.payoffs

    num_cooperators_prev_round = count of players in previous_actions who played C
    average_contribution_rate_prev_round = num_cooperators_prev_round / n

    // Check if player i cooperated in the previous round
    did_i_cooperate_prev_round = (previous_actions[player_id] == C)

    // Calculate potential payoff if everyone had cooperated in the previous round
    // Assuming the player also cooperated to get a baseline for comparison
    // The total contribution would be n if everyone cooperated
    // Player's share of public good would be (k/n) * n = k
    // Player's private payoff from endowment would be 1 - 1 = 0
    // Potential max payoff for player i if i cooperated and everyone else cooperated: 0 + k = k
    // NOTE: A more accurate "ideal cooperation" payoff for player i in previous round
    // would be based on the *actual* number of cooperators in previous_round,
    // if the player *had* cooperated. This is complex to calculate without knowing
    // other players' intended actions. A simpler proxy is to compare to the
    // payoff when player *i* cooperated in the previous round and see how much it dropped.

    // Let's refine the payoff drop check:
    // Player i's payoff in the previous round
    my_previous_payoff = previous_payoffs[player_id]

    // Calculate what player i's payoff *would have been* in the previous round if they had cooperated,
    // assuming the same number of cooperators as actually occurred.
    // This is still tricky. A simpler, robust approach:
    // If player i cooperated, compare their payoff to the average payoff of defectors in that round.
    // If player i defected, compare their payoff to the average payoff of cooperators in that round.

    // A more direct payoff drop detection:
    // Calculate the expected payoff if player i *had* cooperated, given the actual number of cooperators.
    // This is still problematic as it assumes the number of cooperators wouldn't change.

    // Simpler Payoff Drop heuristic:
    // If player i cooperated in the previous round, and their payoff is significantly lower than
    // the average payoff of defectors in that round, it's a strong signal of free-riding.
    // If player i defected in the previous round, and their payoff is significantly lower than
    // the average payoff of cooperators, it's a signal that cooperation was beneficial and
    // they might have missed out.

    // Let's use a simpler payoff drop indicator:
    // If player i cooperated, and their payoff is less than the payoff they would get by defecting
    // in that same round (assuming the same number of cooperators), it's a bad sign.

    // Calculate the payoff if player i had defected in the previous round, given the actual number of cooperators.
    // If player i had defected, their c_i would be 0. Their private payoff would be 1.
    // The share of public good would be (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev_round.
    // Expected payoff if player i defected: 1 + (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev_round

    expected_defect_payoff_prev_round = 1 + (k / n) * num_cooperators_prev_round

    payoff_drop_detected = False
    if did_i_cooperate_prev_round:
        // Player i cooperated. If their payoff is significantly less than defecting, they were exploited.
        if my_previous_payoff < expected_defect_payoff_prev_round * (1 - PDT):
            payoff_drop_detected = True
    // else: If player i defected, they already got their private endowment.
    // We are primarily concerned with exploitation when we cooperate.

    // Decision Logic:
    if average_contribution_rate_prev_round >= CT and not payoff_drop_detected:
      return C // Cooperate if average cooperation is high and no exploitation

    else:
      return D // Defect if average cooperation is low or exploitation is detected
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode and Refinements:**

*   **`CT` and `PDT`:** These are hyperparameters that would be tuned for optimal performance in a tournament setting. `CT` represents the minimum proportion of cooperators required to maintain cooperation. `PDT` defines how much of a "loss" from a more favorable outcome (in this case, the payoff from defecting when others cooperate) is tolerated before reacting.
*   **`history`:** This is assumed to be a data structure that stores the actions and payoffs of all players for each round.
*   **`did_i_cooperate_prev_round`:** This variable helps in the payoff drop detection logic.
*   **`expected_defect_payoff_prev_round`:** This calculates the payoff player `i` *would have received* if they had defected in the previous round, given the *actual* number of cooperators in that round.
*   **Payoff Drop Detection Logic:** The logic `my_previous_payoff < expected_defect_payoff_prev_round * (1 - PDT)` checks if the player's actual payoff from cooperating was significantly lower (by `PDT` percentage) than what they *could have gained* by defecting in that same round. This is a strong indicator of being exploited.

This strategy balances the desire for collective good with self-preservation, making it robust to a variety of opponent behaviors in a repeated game without communication.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_125 = '''
This strategy aims to achieve high collective payoffs by fostering cooperation, while also protecting itself from exploitation. It is designed to be adaptive, learning from the history of the game and adjusting its behavior accordingly.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Reciprocity"

**Core Philosophy:** "Adaptive Reciprocity" is built on the principle of conditional cooperation. It aims to maximize total welfare by cooperating when it believes others are likely to do the same, and defecting when it perceives a high risk of exploitation. It learns and adapts its cooperation threshold based on observed behavior.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to cooperate (C) or defect (D) for player `i` in round `t` depends on two primary factors:

*   **Observed Cooperation Rate in the Previous Round:** The strategy monitors how many players cooperated in the immediately preceding round.
*   **A Dynamic Cooperation Threshold:** This threshold represents the minimum observed cooperation rate required to trigger cooperation in the current round. It is not static but adapts over time.

**Detailed Decision Logic:**

*   **If `t = 1` (First Round):** The strategy will **Cooperate (C)**. This is a strong initial signal of cooperation, aiming to kickstart a cooperative dynamic.
*   **If `t > 1`:**
    1.  **Calculate the observed cooperation rate in round `t-1`:** Let `N_cooperators(t-1)` be the number of players who cooperated in round `t-1`. The observed cooperation rate is `Observed_Rate(t-1) = N_cooperators(t-1) / n`.
    2.  **Update the Dynamic Cooperation Threshold:** The threshold is adjusted based on the `Observed_Rate(t-1)`.
        *   **If `Observed_Rate(t-1)` is high (e.g., ≥ 0.8):** The threshold is maintained or slightly increased (e.g., `Threshold = max(0.5, Threshold)`). This reinforces trust in a cooperative environment.
        *   **If `Observed_Rate(t-1)` is moderate (e.g., ≥ 0.4 and < 0.8):** The threshold is maintained (e.g., `Threshold = Threshold`). This signifies a stable, albeit not perfectly cooperative, environment.
        *   **If `Observed_Rate(t-1)` is low (e.g., < 0.4):** The threshold is lowered (e.g., `Threshold = max(0.1, Threshold * 0.9)`). This makes it easier to switch to cooperation if signs of cooperative intent emerge.
        *   **Crucially, the threshold will have a minimum value (e.g., 0.1) to prevent it from becoming zero and always defecting, and a maximum value (e.g., 1.0) to ensure it never demands perfect cooperation.**
    3.  **Make the Decision:**
        *   **If `Observed_Rate(t-1) ≥ Threshold`:** **Cooperate (C)**. The observed behavior meets or exceeds the current required level of cooperation.
        *   **If `Observed_Rate(t-1) < Threshold`:** **Defect (D)**. The observed behavior falls below the required level of cooperation, suggesting a risk of exploitation.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):** This is a critical edge case. In the very last round, the incentive to cooperate for future rounds disappears. Therefore, in the last round, the strategy will **always Defect (D)**, regardless of the previous round's cooperation rate. This is a form of "unraveling" from the end, a standard concept in repeated games.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t = 1`):** As mentioned, the strategy **always Cooperates (C)**. This is a bold move to establish a cooperative norm.
*   **Last Round (`t = r`):** The strategy **always Defects (D)**. This is a rational response to the lack of future incentives to cooperate.
*   **Sudden Drops in Cooperation:** The adaptive threshold mechanism is designed to handle this. If there's a significant drop in cooperation in a given round, the `Observed_Rate(t-1)` will fall below the `Threshold`, triggering defection in the next round. The threshold will then adjust downwards, making it easier to initiate cooperation again if even a small number of players start cooperating.
*   **Sustained Low Cooperation:** If cooperation remains consistently low, the threshold will decrease, but the strategy will continue to defect until the observed cooperation rate *exceeds* the lowered threshold. This prevents being exploited by a strategy that always defects.
*   **Perfect Cooperation:** If all players cooperate, the `Observed_Rate(t-1)` will be 1. The threshold will likely remain at its maximum (1.0), and the strategy will continue to cooperate.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative in its design and intent:

*   **Starts Cooperative:** The initial act of cooperation in round 1 is a deliberate choice to *initiate* and *promote* cooperation.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** It continues to cooperate as long as a sufficient proportion of other players are also cooperating. This provides a positive feedback loop for cooperative behavior.
*   **Adaptive Threshold for Flexibility:** While it punishes defection by defecting in return, the adaptive nature of the threshold means it doesn't get "stuck" in a cycle of mutual defection. It's willing to "forgive" past defections and re-enter cooperation if enough players show signs of doing so.
*   **Maximizes Collective Payoff:** By aiming for sustained periods of cooperation, it seeks to maximize the total payoff for all players, which is significantly higher than perpetual defection (where each player gets 1).

        # Update the dynamic cooperation threshold
        if observed_cooperation_rate_prev_round >= 0.8: # High cooperation
            dynamic_cooperation_threshold = max(min_threshold, dynamic_cooperation_threshold * 1.05) # Slightly increase to encourage more cooperation
            dynamic_cooperation_threshold = min(max_threshold, dynamic_cooperation_threshold)
        elif observed_cooperation_rate_prev_round >= 0.4 and observed_cooperation_rate_prev_round < 0.8: # Moderate cooperation
            pass # Threshold remains the same
        else: # Low cooperation
            dynamic_cooperation_threshold *= threshold_adjustment_factor
            dynamic_cooperation_threshold = max(min_threshold, dynamic_cooperation_threshold)

        # Decision based on threshold
        if observed_cooperation_rate_prev_round >= dynamic_cooperation_threshold:

        else:
            my_action = 'D'

    my_past_actions.append(my_action)
    return my_action

```

**Rationale for Adaptive Threshold Tuning:**

The specific values for the threshold updates (0.8, 0.4, 0.9, 1.05) are initial suggestions. These can be further tuned through simulation or by observing performance in the tournament. The goal is to strike a balance between being responsive to negative signals (defecting) and being forgiving enough to re-enter cooperation when opportunities arise. The upward adjustment in high cooperation scenarios is to try and push towards perfect cooperation if it's already being achieved.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_126 = '''
This strategy is designed to foster cooperation in the N-Player Public Goods Game by rewarding past cooperation and punishing defection, while also being forgiving to encourage a return to cooperation. It adapts based on the observed behavior of other players.

## Cooperative Strategy: "Forgiving Tit-for-Tat with Threshold"

This strategy is a variation of Tit-for-Tat, adapted for a public goods game with multiple players. It aims to incentivize cooperation by mirroring the collective behavior of the group, with a mechanism to recover from periods of widespread defection.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Reward Cooperation:** Actively cooperate when the group has demonstrated a tendency towards cooperation.
2.  **Punish Defection:** Defect when the group has demonstrated a tendency towards defection.
3.  **Forgiveness:** Allow for a return to cooperation even after periods of defection, provided there's a sufficient shift back towards cooperation from the group.
4.  **Adaptability:** Adjust its cooperative behavior based on observed group dynamics.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` depends on the observed behavior of the *entire group* in the previous round `t-1`.

Let `N_cooperators_t-1` be the number of players who played Cooperate in round `t-1`.

*   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` > `CooperationThreshold`:**
    *   Player `i` plays **C** (Cooperate).
    *   *Rationale:* The group has shown a sufficient level of cooperation in the previous round, so reciprocate that.

*   **Else if `N_cooperators_t-1` < `DefectionThreshold`:**
    *   Player `i` plays **D** (Defect).
    *   *Rationale:* The group has shown a strong tendency towards defection, so it's individually rational to defect to protect one's endowment.

*   **Else (i.e., `DefectionThreshold` ≤ `N_cooperators_t-1` ≤ `CooperationThreshold`):**
    *   Player `i` plays **C** (Cooperate).
    *   *Rationale:* This is the "forgiving" zone. Even if defection has been prevalent, as long as it hasn't reached an extreme level, we try to push back towards cooperation. This is crucial for recovering from cycles of mutual defection.

### Defining the Thresholds:

The `CooperationThreshold` and `DefectionThreshold` are crucial parameters that make this strategy adaptive. They are not static but can be adjusted based on the game parameters and potentially the observed behavior over a longer history. For simplicity and robustness, we'll define them as follows initially:

*   **`CooperationThreshold`:** Let's set this to be **half of the players who would achieve a positive payoff from cooperating if everyone else also cooperated.**
    *   If everyone cooperates, each player gets `(k/n) * n = k`.
    *   If only one player defects, that player gets `1` and others get `(k/n) * (n-1)`.
    *   A good initial value for `CooperationThreshold` would be around **`n / 2`**. More precisely, we want a level of cooperation where the collective benefit starts to outweigh the individual cost of contributing. A threshold of `n/2` is a good starting point, meaning if more than half cooperate, we lean towards cooperation.

*   **`DefectionThreshold`:** This should be a lower bar than `CooperationThreshold`. It signifies a point where defection is so widespread that it's rational to join in.
    *   A good initial value for `DefectionThreshold` would be **`n / 4`**. If less than a quarter of the players are cooperating, it's a strong signal that widespread defection is the norm.

**Therefore, the core decision logic becomes:**

*   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` > `n / 2`:** Cooperate.
*   **Else if `N_cooperators_t-1` < `n / 4`:** Defect.
*   **Else:** Cooperate (Forgiving zone).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Since there is no history, the strategy defaults to **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* To kickstart cooperation and provide an opportunity for others to reciprocate. This aligns with a cooperative mindset.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   In the last round, the incentive to maintain cooperation for future rounds disappears. The dominant strategy in a single-shot game is to defect. Therefore, in the last round, the strategy plays **D (Defect)**.
    *   *Rationale:* To maximize individual payoff in the absence of future considerations. This is a standard adjustment for finite repeated games.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The strategy is inherently cooperative in its default actions and its response to observed group behavior.

*   **Default to Cooperation:** The first round and the "forgiving zone" clearly demonstrate a proactive approach to cooperation.
*   **Reciprocity:** It rewards observed cooperation by cooperating itself.
*   **Punishment with Recovery:** While it punishes defection by defecting, it doesn't immediately get stuck in a defection cycle. The forgiving zone allows for a return to cooperation if the group shows any signs of shifting back.
*   **Parameter Alignment:** The thresholds are set relative to `n`, making the strategy adaptable to different group sizes. The core idea is that cooperation is most beneficial when a significant portion of the group contributes, and conversely, defection is individually rational when very few are cooperating.

### Pseudocode:

// Parameters
n: number of players
r: number of rounds
k: multiplication factor (not directly used in decision logic, but underlies payoffs)

// Strategy for Player i
function decide_action(current_round, history):
    // history is a list of (player_actions_in_round_t) for t from 1 to current_round-1
    // player_actions_in_round_t is a list of actions taken by all players in round t

    // Handle Last Round
    if current_round == r:
        return D // Defect in the last round

    // Handle First Round
    if current_round == 1:
        return C // Cooperate in the first round

    // For intermediate rounds: analyze the previous round's behavior
    previous_round_actions = history[current_round - 1] // Actions from round t-1
    num_cooperators_previous_round = count_cooperators(previous_round_actions)

    cooperation_threshold = n / 2
    defection_threshold = n / 4

    if num_cooperators_previous_round > cooperation_threshold:
        return C // Group cooperated, so we cooperate
    else if num_cooperators_previous_round < defection_threshold:
        return D // Group defected heavily, so we defect
    else:
        return C // Forgiving zone: encourage return to cooperation

// Helper function to count cooperators

    count = 0
    for action in actions_list:
        if action == C:
            count = count + 1
    return count

```

**Robustness Considerations:**

*   **Against "Always Defect":** This strategy will eventually defect against an "Always Defect" opponent if that opponent's defection causes the group average to fall below the defection threshold. However, in a large group, one player defecting might not significantly alter the outcome if others cooperate.
*   **Against "Always Cooperate":** This strategy will consistently cooperate with an "Always Cooperate" opponent as long as the group size doesn't push the thresholds to trigger defection.
*   **Against "Tit-for-Tat" (in a pairwise sense):** If the game were pairwise, this would behave like Tit-for-Tat. In an N-player game, it responds to the *group's* behavior, which can be more complex. It's more resilient to individual defections as long as the group average stays high.
*   **Against "Grim Trigger":** Grim Trigger defects forever after the first defection. This strategy is more forgiving and can recover from defection cycles.

This strategy aims to be a stable force for cooperation, capable of initiating it, rewarding it, and recovering from its lapses, all while being rational in the final round.

description_COOPERATIVE_127 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, aiming for adaptability and robustness:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness"

This strategy draws inspiration from successful repeated game strategies but adapts it to the public goods context. The core idea is to foster cooperation by mirroring the collective behavior of the group, while also incorporating a mechanism to recover from defection and encourage future cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round `t` (where `t > 1`) is based on the overall level of cooperation observed in the *previous* round (`t-1`).

*   **Cooperate (C):**
    If the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round (`t-1`) was **greater than or equal to a threshold `θ`**. This threshold represents a minimum level of collective commitment to cooperation that is deemed sustainable.

*   **Defect (D):**
    If the proportion of players who cooperated in the previous round (`t-1`) was **less than the threshold `θ`**. This indicates a breakdown in collective cooperation, and the strategy temporarily retreats to self-preservation.

**The Threshold `θ`:**

The threshold `θ` is a crucial parameter for this strategy. It should be set slightly above the point where individual defection is more profitable than cooperation, given the game parameters. Specifically, we want to find the point where `k/n < 1`. This occurs when `k < n`, which is already a condition of the game.

A good starting point for `θ` can be derived from considering the condition where a single defector makes a profit. If `m` players cooperate and `n-m` players defect, a cooperator gets `(k/n) * m` and a defector gets `1 + (k/n) * m`. For defection to be tempting, `1 + (k/n) * m > (k/n) * m`, which is always true. However, we want to set `θ` to encourage cooperation when the *collective* is doing well.

Consider the point where cooperation is **just barely** more profitable for the *group* than universal defection. If everyone cooperates, the total payoff is `n * 2 = 2n`. If everyone defects, the total payoff is `n * 1 = n`. The difference `n` comes from the public good.

A more pragmatic approach for `θ` is to set it based on a belief about a "minimal viable level of cooperation" that makes the public good contribution worthwhile. Since `k < n`, the share of the public good per player is always less than their endowment. This means defection is always individually rational in a one-shot game. Therefore, the strategy must rely on the *collective benefit* of cooperation.

Let's define `θ` as the minimum proportion of cooperators required to make the *average* payoff from cooperation at least as good as the average payoff from defection.

If `x` players cooperate:
*   Payoff for a cooperator = `(k/n) * x`
*   Payoff for a defector = `1 + (k/n) * x`

We want to find `x` such that the average payoff for all players is maximized. The total payoff for the group is `x * (k/n) * x + (n-x) * (1 + (k/n) * x)`. This is complex.

A simpler, more strategic approach for `θ` is to consider the **incentive to defect**. A player defects if `1 > (k/n) * x`. This inequality holds if `x < n/k`. Since `k < n`, `n/k > 1`. This means if *even one player* defects, it can become individually rational for others to defect too if the number of cooperators is not high enough.

Therefore, to sustain cooperation, we need the number of cooperators to be **sufficiently high** to deter defections. A reasonable threshold `θ` would be one that ensures the public good contribution is significant enough.

**Recommended `θ`:** `θ = max(0.5, k/n)`. This ensures that at least half the players cooperate, or if `k/n` is higher, that the per-player share of the public good is substantial. We use `max(0.5, k/n)` because a threshold of 0.5 is a good general-purpose indicator of a majority supporting cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    In the absence of any history, the strategy defaults to **Cooperate (C)**. This is an initial optimistic stance, aiming to kickstart a cooperative norm. The assumption is that if others also start cooperatively, a positive feedback loop can emerge.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    In the final round, the incentive to maintain cooperation for future rounds disappears. Therefore, in the last round, the strategy will **always Defect (D)**. This is a rational response to the end of the game, as there are no future consequences for defection.

*   **After a Full Defection Round:**
    If in a previous round, *all* players defected (`total_cooperators = 0`), the strategy will also **Defect (D)** in the current round, regardless of the `θ` threshold. This is a protective measure to avoid being exploited by a potentially persistently defecting group. However, this defection is not permanent.

*   **Forgiveness Mechanism (Adapting from Tit-for-Tat):**
    This strategy incorporates a "forgiveness" element to encourage recovery from periods of low cooperation. If the strategy has been defecting for a few consecutive rounds (say, `M` rounds), and then observes a significant increase in cooperation (e.g., the proportion of cooperators jumps back above `θ`), it will **Cooperate (C)** in the next round. This allows the group to "reset" and attempt to re-establish cooperation. The number of rounds for this "forgiveness period" (`M`) could be a small constant, like 2 or 3.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

The strategy is inherently cooperative in its initial stance and its reliance on collective behavior. It aims to:

*   **Promote a higher collective payoff:** By defaulting to cooperation and encouraging it when the group shows commitment, it seeks to achieve the higher payoffs available when many players contribute.
*   **Signal a desire for cooperation:** The initial cooperation sets a positive example.
*   **Be resilient to exploitation:** The threshold and forgiveness mechanisms prevent the strategy from being a perpetual victim of defection.
*   **Adapt to group dynamics:** It doesn't rigidly adhere to a fixed action but responds dynamically to the observed actions of the other players.

This strategy balances the desire for cooperation with the necessity of adapting to the actions of others. It's designed to be a strong contender in a diverse tournament by not being overly naive but still prioritizing the benefits of collective action.
'''

description_COOPERATIVE_128 = '''
Here's a cooperative strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on adaptiveness and robustness to varied opponent behaviors while adhering to the specified constraints:

## Cooperative Strategy: "Conditional Commitment"

This strategy aims to foster cooperation by making an initial commitment to cooperate, but with a clear understanding that defection will be met with retaliation. It then seeks to return to cooperation once sufficient cooperative behavior is observed. The core idea is to reward cooperation and punish defection, while allowing for recovery of cooperative norms.

### Strategy Rationale:

The key challenge in this game is the "tragedy of the commons." While mutual cooperation yields the highest joint payoff, individual defection is always tempting because the cost of defection is borne solely by the defector, while the benefit of cooperation is shared. This strategy attempts to overcome this by:

*   **Initiating cooperation:** To signal a desire for mutual benefit and to explore the possibility of cooperative outcomes.
*   **Conditional defection:** To punish defections and deter future free-riding.
*   **Forgiveness/Re-initiation:** To allow for a return to cooperation after a period of demonstrated cooperation, recognizing that single defections might be mistakes or strategic responses that are no longer necessary.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The strategy operates with a state variable, `cooperative_state`, which can be `TRUE` (cooperating) or `FALSE` (retaliating/testing for cooperation).

*   **If `cooperative_state` is `TRUE` (Current goal is to cooperate):**
    *   **Action:** Play **C (Cooperate)**.
    *   **Condition for switching to `FALSE`:** If in the *previous round*, the proportion of players who defected (including oneself, if one defected) exceeds a defined threshold, `defection_threshold`. Specifically, if `(n - total_cooperators_last_round) / n > defection_threshold`.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the default state to encourage cooperation. We only defect if cooperation is significantly undermined.

*   **If `cooperative_state` is `FALSE` (Current goal is to test for cooperation or retaliate):**
    *   **Action:** Play **D (Defect)**.
    *   **Condition for switching back to `TRUE`:** If in the *previous round*, the proportion of players who cooperated (including oneself, if one cooperated) exceeds a defined threshold, `cooperation_recovery_threshold`. Specifically, if `total_cooperators_last_round / n > cooperation_recovery_threshold`.
    *   **Rationale:** This state is entered after observing widespread defection. By defecting, we signal our displeasure and avoid being exploited. We only return to cooperation if a sufficiently large majority has demonstrated their commitment to cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Action:** Play **C (Cooperate)**.
    *   **Initial `cooperative_state`:** Set `cooperative_state` to `TRUE`.
    *   **Rationale:** To kickstart cooperation and give the game a chance to develop a cooperative norm. This is a bold but necessary step in a repeated game to explore beneficial outcomes.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Action:** Play **D (Defect)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The temptation to defect for a final private gain becomes dominant, as there's no incentive to maintain a cooperative relationship. This is a standard grim trigger-like behavior in finite games.

*   **Second to Last Round (t = r-1):**
    *   **Action:** The strategy plays according to its `cooperative_state` (C if `TRUE`, D if `FALSE`).
    *   **Rationale:** The decision in `r-1` is influenced by the state of cooperation in `r-2`. The strategy does not preemptively defect in `r-1` based solely on it being the second-to-last round. The last-round defection is a specific, hardcoded behavior.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

*   **Initial Commitment:** The strategy begins by cooperating, signaling a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial behavior.
*   **Proportional Response:** The strategy doesn't immediately punish for minor deviations. It requires a significant proportion of players to defect before it resorts to defection. This allows for forgiveness of isolated incidents.
*   **Recovery Mechanism:** The strategy is designed to return to cooperation once a sufficient majority demonstrates cooperative intent. This prevents a permanent downward spiral into mutual defection.
*   **Focus on Joint Payoff (Implicitly):** By aiming for widespread cooperation, the strategy implicitly prioritizes states where the sum of payoffs is maximized, which is the essence of cooperation in this game.

### Parameters for the Strategy:

*   `defection_threshold`: A float between 0 and 1. This determines how many defections trigger a switch to retaliation. A value like **0.4** or **0.5** could be reasonable. If 40-50% of players defect, we switch to D.
*   `cooperation_recovery_threshold`: A float between 0 and 1. This determines how much cooperation is needed to return to C. It should ideally be higher than `defection_threshold` to ensure stable cooperation. A value like **0.7** or **0.8** could be appropriate. If 70-80% of players cooperate, we can attempt to return to C.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Game Parameters (given)
// n: number of players
// r: number of rounds
// k: multiplication factor

// Strategy Parameters
defection_threshold = 0.4  // Example: if >40% defect, retaliate
cooperation_recovery_threshold = 0.7 // Example: if >70% cooperate, try cooperating again

// State Variables
cooperative_state = TRUE // Initially aiming for cooperation
last_total_cooperators = 0 // To store the count from the previous round

// Function: Decide Action for Player i in Round t
function decide_action(player_id, current_round, history):
  // Handle Last Round: Always defect
  if current_round == r:
    return D

  // Handle First Round: Always cooperate and initialize state
  if current_round == 1:
    cooperative_state = TRUE
    last_total_cooperators = 0 // No previous round yet
    return C

  // Determine total cooperators in the previous round
  // history is assumed to be a list of lists, where history[t-1] contains actions of all players in round t-1
  previous_round_actions = history[current_round - 2] // Access actions from round t-1
  previous_total_cooperators = count_cooperators(previous_round_actions)
  last_total_cooperators = previous_total_cooperators // Update for next round's decision

  // Get player i's action in the previous round
  player_i_previous_action = previous_round_actions[player_id]

  // Calculate proportion of defectors in the previous round
  proportion_defectors_last_round = (n - last_total_cooperators) / n

  // Calculate proportion of cooperators in the previous round
  proportion_cooperators_last_round = last_total_cooperators / n

  // Decision Logic based on cooperative_state
  if cooperative_state == TRUE:
    // Currently aiming to cooperate
    if proportion_defectors_last_round > defection_threshold:
      // Too many defections, switch to retaliate state
      cooperative_state = FALSE
      return D // Defect in this round
    else:
      // Cooperation is holding, continue cooperating
      return C
  else: // cooperative_state == FALSE
    // Currently in retaliation/testing state
    if proportion_cooperators_last_round > cooperation_recovery_threshold:
      // Sufficient cooperation observed, attempt to return to cooperating
      cooperative_state = TRUE
      return C // Cooperate in this round
    else:
      // Still insufficient cooperation, continue retaliating
      return D // Defect in this round

// Helper function to count cooperators from a list of actions
function count_cooperators(actions_list):
  count = 0
  for action in actions_list:
    if action == C:
      count = count + 1
  return count

// Initialization for the tournament
// On the first round, call decide_action(my_id, 1, [])
// In subsequent rounds, call decide_action(my_id, current_round, game_history)
```

**Note on History:** The `history` parameter in the pseudocode would need to be managed by the tournament system. It would likely be a list of rounds, where each round contains a list of actions taken by all players in that round.

This "Conditional Commitment" strategy is designed to be robust by not being overly sensitive to single defections, but decisive when cooperation breaks down. It also has a mechanism for recovery, allowing it to capitalize on potentially cooperative opponents.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_1 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff while being robust and adaptive. The core idea is to exploit cooperation when it's beneficial and defect decisively when it's not.

## Aggressive Exploitation Strategy: "The Opportunist"

This strategy is built on the principle of **conditional exploitation**. It aims to gain the maximum private benefit by defecting when the collective benefit of cooperation is insufficient to outweigh the individual gain from defecting, and it will exploit cooperative behavior from others whenever possible.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Defect by Default, Cooperate by Necessity:** My primary inclination is to defect. I only cooperate when the expected payoff from doing so *outperforms* the payoff from defecting, considering the current round's likely outcome and the potential for future retaliation.
*   **Exploit the Collective:** I aim to benefit from the contributions of others without contributing myself, whenever this is advantageous.
*   **Punish Defection, But Not at My Own Expense:** If others consistently defect, I will also defect to protect my private endowment. However, I will not sacrifice my own payoff to "teach a lesson" if that lesson comes at a greater cost to me than the observed defection.
*   **Last Round Dominance:** The final round is critical. In the last round, there are no future repercussions, so pure self-interest dictates defection to maximize the final payoff.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

My decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` depends on a few factors:

*   **The Current Cooperation Rate:** The perceived likelihood of others cooperating.
*   **The Multiplication Factor (k/n):** The efficiency of the public good.
*   **The Round Number (t):** Especially the proximity to the last round.

**Decision Logic:**

**In any round `t` (except the last round):**

*   **Calculate Expected Private Payoff from Defection:**
    If I defect, my private payoff is always `1`. My share of the public good depends on the number of other cooperators. I'll estimate this based on past rounds, but for a robust strategy, I'll make a conservative assumption. Let's assume the *minimum* number of other cooperators I expect to see to make cooperation potentially worthwhile is `C_min`. If `k/n` is low, `C_min` will be higher.
    *   *Initial thought:* If I defect, my payoff is `1`. If at least one other player cooperates, my total payoff from their cooperation will be `1 + (k/n) * (1)`.
    *   *Refined approach:* I will evaluate the *gain* from cooperation. If I cooperate, my private payoff is `0`. My total payoff is `(k/n) * (total_cooperators)`. If I defect, my private payoff is `1`. My total payoff is `1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1)` (if others cooperate).

*   **Calculate Expected Payoff from Cooperation:**
    If I cooperate, my private payoff is `0`. My total payoff is `(k/n) * (total_cooperators + 1)`.

*   **The Decision Threshold:** I will cooperate *only if* the expected payoff from cooperation *significantly* outweighs the payoff from defecting, considering the potential for others to exploit me.

    **Decision Rule for Round `t` (where `t < r`):**

    **Defect (D)** IF:
    `1 > (k/n) * (my_contribution_if_i_cooperate)`  (This is the core self-interest check: Is my guaranteed private endowment greater than my share of the public good if I contribute?)
    OR
    `history_of_defection_by_others > threshold_for_punishment` (If others have been defecting heavily, I will too.)

    **Cooperate (C)** IF:
    `k/n` is sufficiently high such that `(k/n) * (minimum_expected_cooperators + 1) > 1` (This means even if only a few others cooperate, and I also cooperate, the outcome is better for me than defecting and getting only `1`).
    AND
    `average_cooperation_rate_in_recent_rounds > threshold_for_cooperation` (There's a good chance others will also cooperate, making my contribution less risky and more rewarding.)
    AND
    `I have been exploited recently (i.e., others defected while I cooperated)` is FALSE.

**Simplified Rule (Focusing on Aggression):**

I will default to **Defect (D)** in almost all situations.

I will **Cooperate (C)** *only if*:

1.  **The immediate payoff from cooperation is demonstrably better than defecting, given the expected number of other cooperators.**
    *   Specifically, if `(k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators - 1)`. This simplifies to `(k/n) * 2 > 1`.
    *   This means I will only consider cooperating if `k/n > 0.5`. If `k/n <= 0.5`, the public good is too inefficient for me to consider contributing, as I'll always get more by keeping my endowment.
2.  **And, the expected number of cooperators in this round (`estimated_total_cooperators`) is high enough that my contribution is likely to be reciprocated or beneficial.** A reasonable heuristic is to look at the average cooperation rate in the past `m` rounds (e.g., `m=min(t-1, 3)`). If this average is above a certain threshold (e.g., `0.6 * n`, meaning at least 60% of players were cooperating on average), I *might* consider cooperating.
3.  **And, I have not been significantly exploited in recent rounds.** If others have consistently defected while I cooperated, I will revert to pure defection.

**Revised, Aggressive Decision Rule:**

*   **Round `t` (where `t < r`):**
    *   **Default:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Consider Cooperating (C) IF:**
        *   `k/n > 0.5` (The public good is efficient enough for potential benefit)
        *   **AND** `historical_average_cooperation_rate >= threshold_for_cooperation` (e.g., `0.7 * n`) (There's a strong indication of collective cooperation).
        *   **AND** `I was not the sole cooperator in the previous round` (i.e., I wasn't exploited).
        *   **AND** `This is not the penultimate round` (to avoid being predictably exploited just before the end).

*   **Round `r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Always Defect (D)**. There are no future consequences.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no history to learn from. The safest and most aggressive play is to secure the private endowment of `1` and observe how others behave. This sets a tone of self-interest. I will not contribute to a public good without any assurance of reciprocity or benefit.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Always Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The game ends, so any cooperation is purely altruistic and would reduce my final payoff. There is no incentive for future-oriented play.

*   **Penultimate Round (t=r-1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** While the public good might be efficient (`k/n > 0.5`), cooperating in the penultimate round can make me a predictable target for exploitation in the final round if others anticipate my cooperative tendency. It's safer to defect to maintain flexibility and avoid signaling weakness just before the end.

*   **Low `k/n` values (k/n <= 0.5):**
    *   **Decision:** **Always Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** If `k/n` is low, the public good is too inefficient. My guaranteed private payoff of `1` will always be greater than or equal to my potential share of the public good, even if all other players cooperate. Cooperating would be irrational.

### 3. Being Aggressive

The aggressive nature of "The Opportunist" is evident in:

*   **Defaulting to Defection:** The strategy starts from a position of self-interest and only deviates if there's a clear, calculated advantage to cooperation.
*   **Prioritizing Private Gain:** The decision rules are designed to maximize individual payoff. Cooperation is a tool for potential gain, not an act of goodwill.
*   **Exploiting Cooperation:** The strategy is designed to benefit from the cooperation of others without necessarily reciprocating unless it's strategically advantageous.
*   **Ruthless Last Round:** The unconditional defection in the last round ensures maximum personal gain at the very end.
*   **Lack of Forgiveness (to a degree):** While the strategy adapts to cooperation, it doesn't inherently forgive past exploitation. If exploited, it will stick to defection until a clear pattern of cooperation re-emerges from others. It will not engage in "retaliatory" cooperation if that would mean sacrificing its own guaranteed endowment.

## The "Ruthless Maximizer" Strategy

This strategy is designed for aggression and maximum individual payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game. It prioritizes immediate gains and punishes deviations from its own perceived optimal cooperation level, while remaining adaptive to the group's overall behavior.

**Core Philosophy:** My goal is to extract the maximum possible payoff for myself. Cooperation is a tool, not a virtue. I will cooperate only when it demonstrably benefits me more than defecting, and I will swiftly punish any perceived exploitation.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect is driven by a calculated assessment of the immediate and potential future gains, considering the observed behavior of the other players.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   Unless a strong incentive exists to do otherwise, I will defect. This is because the private return from defection (1) is guaranteed, while the public good's return is uncertain and depends on others' actions.

*   **Conditional Cooperation (C):**
    *   I will cooperate *only if* the expected payoff from cooperating in the current round is strictly greater than the payoff from defecting.
    *   **Calculating Expected Payoff from Cooperating (E[π_C]):**
        *   Let $N_C$ be the current number of players I *expect* to cooperate in this round. This includes myself.
        *   My payoff if I cooperate will be: $E[\pi_C] = (1 - 1) + (k/n) \times N_C = (k/n) \times N_C$.
    *   **Calculating Payoff from Defecting (π_D):**
        *   My payoff if I defect will be: $\pi_D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) \times N_{C, \text{others}}$, where $N_{C, \text{others}}$ is the number of *other* players I expect to cooperate. This simplifies to $1 + (k/n) \times N_{C, \text{others}}$.
    *   **Decision Rule:** I will play C if $E[\pi_C] > \pi_D$.
        *   $(k/n) \times N_C > 1 + (k/n) \times N_{C, \text{others}}$
        *   Substituting $N_C = N_{C, \text{others}} + 1$ (since I am considering cooperating):
        *   $(k/n) \times (N_{C, \text{others}} + 1) > 1 + (k/n) \times N_{C, \text{others}}$
        *   $(k/n) \times N_{C, \text{others}} + k/n > 1 + (k/n) \times N_{C, \text{others}}$
        *   $k/n > 1$
        *   **This inequality simplifies to $k > n$. However, the game specification states $k < n$. This means that purely based on the one-round payoff calculation and the given parameters, there is *never* a situation where cooperating *guarantees* a higher immediate payoff than defecting if others' actions are uncertain.**

    *   **Revising Conditional Cooperation for Aggression and Adaptation:** Since the immediate math favors defection, my "conditional cooperation" must be a strategic tool to *induce* better outcomes for me in future rounds.
        *   **I will cooperate if and only if:**
            1.  The total number of cooperators in the *previous* round was at least $\lceil n \times (1 - \epsilon) \rceil$, where $\epsilon$ is a small tolerance (e.g., 0.1). This indicates a strong group inclination towards cooperation.
            2.  OR, if my *own* payoff in the previous round from cooperating (if I did) was at least $1.1$ times the payoff I would have received if I had defected *in that same previous round*, assuming the same number of other cooperators. This is a sophisticated form of "rewarding" cooperation that benefited me significantly.
            3.  **The core aggressive adaptation:** If the number of cooperators in the previous round falls *below* a certain threshold (e.g., $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$), I will immediately revert to defecting for a set number of rounds (punishment phase) regardless of my own past payoffs. This is a clear signal that I will not tolerate freeloading.

*   **Aggressive Punishment:** If I defect and other players cooperate, and the resulting collective payoff is less than what I would have achieved if everyone defected, I will initiate a punishment phase.
    *   **Punishment Trigger:** If, in the previous round, I played D, and the total number of cooperators was $C_{prev}$, my payoff was $1 + (k/n) \times C_{prev}$. If this payoff is less than the payoff I would have received if *all* players had defected (which is 1), I will punish.
    *   **Punishment Mechanism:** I will defect for a predetermined number of rounds, say $P = \lfloor r/5 \rfloor$ (punishment length as a fraction of total rounds), or until the number of cooperators consistently rises back to a high level (e.g., $> n/2$). This period of defection is designed to signal my intolerance for low cooperation levels and to maximize my individual gain during this phase.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Aggressive Open:** I will **Defect (D)**. This is my default aggressive stance. The game has not established any patterns, and there's no history to exploit or react to. I aim to secure my guaranteed payoff of 1.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for my actions. My sole objective is to maximize my payoff in this single round, which means defecting to secure the guaranteed private payoff of 1. Any attempts at cooperation are purely altruistic or based on future gains that no longer exist.

*   **Rounds Before the Last (r-1, r-2, ...):**
    *   My decision rules as outlined above apply. However, my "punishment phase" or "cooperation threshold" calculations will heavily weigh the immediate proximity to the final round. If a punishment phase would extend into the last round, I will end it early to defect in the final round.

### 3. Being Aggressive

*   **Proactive Punishment:** I don't wait to be exploited; I proactively punish deviations from my perceived optimal group behavior. If the group's cooperation level dips too low, I take aggressive action to correct it.
*   **Maximizing My Own Gain:** My conditional cooperation is solely for self-benefit. If cooperating doesn't lead to a higher *personal* payoff (either immediately or by incentivizing better group behavior that benefits me later), I defect.
*   **No Forgiveness (Initially):** My strategy is not built on trust. I will defect by default and only "consider" cooperation if the group's prior actions strongly suggest it's beneficial *to me*. If cooperation falters, I immediately revert to a punitive defection strategy.
*   **High Bar for Cooperation:** The conditions under which I will cooperate are stringent. They require a demonstrably high level of cooperation in the previous round, or a strong personal benefit from my past cooperation, ensuring I'm not a sucker for group projects.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunist"

This strategy, "The Opportunist," is designed to maximize individual gains in the N-Player Public Goods Game by exploiting opportunities for higher payoffs while punishing defection and maintaining a readiness to cooperate when it is demonstrably beneficial. It's built on the premise that in a repeated game with no communication, proactive self-interest and swift retaliation are key to aggressive success.

**Core Philosophy:** Assume others will defect until proven otherwise. Strike hard when others cooperate, but don't be a sucker for long. Maximize your individual payoff in every round, and punish any deviation from your perceived optimal strategy.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The Opportunist's decision to cooperate or defect is driven by a calculated assessment of the current round's potential payoff and a historical record of opponent behavior.

*   **Initial Defection Threshold:** In the vast majority of cases, the Opportunist will **Defect (D)**. Cooperation is the exception, not the rule.
*   **Trigger for Cooperation:** The Opportunist will **Cooperate (C)** *only if* it can anticipate a higher *individual* payoff by doing so, given the *expected* actions of other players. This is determined by the following rule:

    **Cooperate if and only if:**
    ```
    (k/n) * (my_cooperators_count + expected_other_cooperators) > 1
    ```
    where:
    *   `my_cooperators_count` is 1 (if I cooperate) or 0 (if I defect).
    *   `expected_other_cooperators` is the strategy's best estimate of how many *other* players will cooperate in the current round.

    **In simpler terms:** I will cooperate if my share of the public good from my own contribution, *plus* my expected share from others' contributions, is greater than the payoff I would get from defecting (which is always 1).

*   **Punishment Mechanism:** The Opportunist maintains a "punishment counter" for each player.
    *   If another player defects when the Opportunist cooperated, their punishment counter increases.
    *   If another player defects when the Opportunist also defected, their punishment counter *decreases* or stays the same (as their defection was not directly costly to the Opportunist in that instance).
    *   The Opportunist will **Defect (D)** if any other player's punishment counter exceeds a predefined **punishment threshold**. This threshold is dynamic and will be discussed in the edge cases.

*   **Adaptation based on observed play:** The `expected_other_cooperators` is not a fixed number. It is an adaptive estimate.
    *   It starts conservatively low.
    *   It increases if multiple players consistently cooperate over several rounds.
    *   It decreases sharply if cooperation breaks down or if a player who was previously cooperating defects.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no historical data to base cooperation decisions on. Aggressively defecting is the safest approach to protect the endowment and observe how others behave without being exploited. The `expected_other_cooperators` is initialized to 0. The punishment counters for all players are initialized to 0.

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to consider. The incentive to cooperate for future gains or to build trust disappears. Pure self-interest dictates maximizing the current round's payoff, which is achieved by defecting. This is a Nash Equilibrium for a single-round game, and it dominates any cooperation in the final round of a repeated game.

*   **Punishment Threshold:**
    *   The punishment threshold is set at **3**. This means that if any single player defects against the Opportunist's cooperation 3 times, the Opportunist will retaliate by defecting against that player for the remainder of the game (or until a significant shift in player behavior occurs, which is unlikely in this aggressive strategy).
    *   The threshold is absolute. It doesn't decay over time. This ensures consistent punishment.

*   **Player-Specific Memory:** The Opportunist will maintain a history of actions for *each* individual player. This allows for targeted punishment. The `expected_other_cooperators` will be an average of the observed cooperation rates of all other players, but the punishment counters are individual.

### 3. Aggressive Design Principles

*   **Proactive Self-Interest:** The strategy prioritizes the player's own payoff. Cooperation is a calculated risk, only undertaken when the individual return is demonstrably higher than defecting.
*   **Swift and Severe Retaliation:** The punishment mechanism is designed to deter exploitation. A player who exploits the Opportunist's cooperation will face immediate and consistent defection in return. This aggressive stance aims to discourage others from testing the Opportunist's patience.
*   **Exploitation of Cooperative Lapses:** If the majority of players are cooperating, The Opportunist will join in *only if* the math dictates a higher individual payoff. If a player *then* defects from a cooperative state, it will be punished severely.
*   **No Forgiveness (in the short term):** The punishment threshold is a strong deterrent. Once triggered, the defecting behavior is met with consistent defection. The strategy doesn't assume "mistakes" can be easily forgiven; it assumes intentional actions.
*   **Adaptability through Observation:** While aggressive, the strategy is not static. It learns from the observed behavior of other players to refine its `expected_other_cooperators` estimate. However, this learning is primarily to inform *when* to cooperate, not to foster a cooperative norm.

```

This strategy is aggressive in its default behavior (defecting), its quickness to punish, and its focus on individual gain. It is adaptive in that it observes and adjusts its cooperation expectations, but it remains robust by not being easily swayed into sustained cooperation without clear, individual-benefit-driven signals and by punishing any perceived exploitation.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_4 = '''
This aggressive strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by exploiting opportunities for defection while punishing deviations from cooperation, all within the framework of a repeated public goods game. It prioritizes immediate gains but also incorporates a long-term perspective to deter sustained defection by opponents.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Predator"

**Core Philosophy:** "I cooperate only when it benefits me directly and immediately, or when forced to by a strong retaliatory signal from the group. I exploit any perceived weakness for personal gain, but I will not be exploited. If others defect, I defect harder and faster."

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The "Predator" strategy operates on a dynamic threshold of perceived cooperation from others. This threshold is influenced by the game parameters and the observed behavior in previous rounds.

**Cooperate (C) if:**

*   **Initial Phase / High Expected Return:** In the very early rounds (defined below), or if the expected payoff from cooperation significantly outweighs defection *given the current perceived cooperation level of other players*. This is a calculated risk for potential future gains or to establish a baseline for retaliation.
*   **Sufficient Group Cooperation:** If the *proportion* of cooperators in the *previous round* is above a dynamically adjusted threshold. This threshold is higher when `k/n` is closer to 1 (meaning cooperation is more beneficial for everyone) and lower when `k/n` is smaller.

**Defect (D) if:**

*   **Low Expected Return from Cooperation:** If the expected payoff from cooperating is less than the guaranteed payoff from defecting, given the current observed cooperation level of others.
*   **Triggered by Defection:** If the *proportion* of cooperators in the *previous round* falls below a certain threshold, or if a significant number of players (including myself) defected in the previous round. This is the core of the retaliatory mechanism.
*   **Exploitative Opportunity:** If I believe defecting will yield a higher payoff in the current round than cooperating, irrespective of others' previous actions (especially if others are cooperating in large numbers).

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**Round 1 (First Round):**

*   **Strategy:** Defect (D).
*   **Rationale:** The "Predator" does not trust. In the absence of any history or signals, the safest and most aggressive move is to secure the guaranteed payoff of 1. This also establishes a clear signal that I am not a free rider.

**Last Round (Round `r`):**

*   **Strategy:** Defect (D).
*   **Rationale:** In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. The only rational decision is to maximize immediate individual payoff by keeping the endowment. This is the ultimate expression of self-interest.

**Pre-Last Round (Round `r-1`):**

*   **Strategy:** This round is crucial for setting the stage for the last round.
    *   If there has been a significant amount of defection in previous rounds (say, more than `n/2` players defected in round `r-2`), then defect in round `r-1`.
    *   Otherwise, cautiously cooperate if the perceived group cooperation level from round `r-2` is high enough to justify it (see "Sufficient Group Cooperation" under Decision Rules). The goal here is to potentially encourage cooperation to set up a better outcome in the last round, but to immediately punish any slippage.

---

### 3. Being Aggressive: The "Predator" Mechanics

The aggression is built into the strategy through several key mechanisms:

*   **Immediate Punishment for Defection:** The "Predator" is quick to retaliate. If the proportion of cooperators drops even slightly below the dynamic threshold, the "Predator" will defect in the next round.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** The "Predator" will cooperate if and only if it believes it can achieve a higher payoff than by defecting, or if the group is cooperating at a level that makes cooperation individually beneficial. This means the "Predator" is willing to cooperate when others are cooperating in sufficient numbers, but it's a calculated move, not altruistic.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold for cooperation is not static.
    *   **Increased Sensitivity to Defection:** If many players defected in previous rounds, the threshold for me to cooperate will increase, meaning I require more cooperation from others to reciprocate.
    *   **Decreased Sensitivity to Cooperation:** If players have been consistently cooperating, the "Predator" might slightly lower its cooperation threshold to see if it can continue to benefit. However, it will snap back aggressively at the first sign of trouble.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy is not designed to forgive extended periods of defection. If a significant portion of players defect, the "Predator" will continue to defect for subsequent rounds, effectively punishing the group and hoping to starve the free-riders by driving down the collective payoff.
*   **Focus on Individual Payoff:** Every decision is ultimately evaluated through the lens of maximizing the "Predator's" own payoff in the current and immediate future rounds.

```

**Robustness and Adaptability:**

*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The `dynamic_cooperation_threshold` ensures the strategy adapts to the overall cooperative or uncooperative nature of the group. It's not rigid and will shift based on observed behavior.
*   **Punishment for Free-Riders:** The immediate switch to Defect upon seeing a drop in cooperation is a strong signal against free-riding.
*   **Exploitation of High Cooperation:** When the group cooperates, the "Predator" can exploit this by also cooperating, maximizing its share of the public good.
*   **Parameter Dependence:** The initial threshold calculation explicitly uses `k/n`, meaning the strategy is inherently sensitive to the game's fundamental incentive structure.

This strategy is designed to be a strong contender in a tournament setting, prioritizing self-interest with a keen eye on exploiting opportunities and punishing deviations from what is perceived as a beneficial (for the Predator) equilibrium. It is aggressive by default, only yielding to cooperation under specific, beneficial conditions.

description_AGGRESSIVE_5 = '''
Here's an aggressive, adaptive, and robust strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff in a tournament setting:

## Strategy: The "Always Punish, Always Exploit" Protocol

This strategy is fundamentally aggressive and prioritizes extracting value while deterring exploitation. It's designed to be unforgiving of defection and to capitalize on the public good when others cooperate, but with a strong bias towards self-interest.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Exploit cooperators:** If others contribute, you will benefit from their cooperation.
*   **Punish defectors:** If others defect, you will not be exploited and will try to inflict a penalty on them.
*   **Self-preservation:** Never be the sole cooperator and bear the cost of others defecting.

### 1. Decision Rules:

Your decision in any given round `t` is determined by a simple, yet powerful, rule:

*   **If the number of cooperators in the *previous* round (`t-1`) was less than `n` (i.e., not all players cooperated):**
    *   **Defect (D).** You will defect if you perceive that the group isn't fully committed to cooperation. This is your primary punishment mechanism.
*   **If the number of cooperators in the *previous* round (`t-1`) was exactly `n` (i.e., all players cooperated):**
    *   **Cooperate (C).** You will reciprocate full cooperation, as this is the highest payoff scenario for everyone, and you are not being exploited.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Defect (D).** In the very first round, you have no history to base a decision on. To immediately establish an aggressive stance and avoid being exploited from the outset, you will defect. This signals that you are not an easy target for free-riders.
*   **The Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Defect (D).** The standard logic in repeated games is that the last round behaves like a one-shot game, leading to defection. Your strategy is already built to defect if the previous round wasn't full cooperation, which naturally covers the last round unless the preceding round was full cooperation. Even then, to maximize your final payoff without the incentive of future rounds to foster cooperation, you will defect. This ensures you extract maximum personal gain in the final opportunity.

### 3. Aggressiveness:

*   **Unwavering Punishment:** The strategy's defining characteristic is its immediate and persistent punishment for anything less than full cooperation. It doesn't forgive or attempt to rebuild trust easily.
*   **Exploiting the "Best Case":** When others *do* cooperate fully, you are happy to join and maximize your payoff in that scenario. This is not "niceness," but rather a recognition that full cooperation yields the highest individual and collective payoff, and you are securing your share.
*   **Immediate Self-Interest:** The strategy prioritizes your own payoff at every turn. It only cooperates when it's demonstrably beneficial to you without any risk of exploitation.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```
// Game Parameters: n, r, k (not directly used in decision logic but define the game)

// State Variables (maintained by the AI player)
previous_round_cooperators = 0
current_round_cooperators = 0 // To track contributions in the current round

// Function to record actions in the current round
record_action(my_action, all_actions_in_round):
  // This function would be called *after* all players have made their move in the current round.
  // It's responsible for counting cooperators among *other* players.
  // For simplicity, we assume we can count total cooperators.
  count = 0
  for player_action in all_actions_in_round:
    if player_action == C:
      count = count + 1
  current_round_cooperators = count

// Function to determine player's action for the next round
decide_action(current_round_number):
  if current_round_number == 1:
    return D // Aggressive start: always defect in round 1

  if current_round_number == r:
    return D // Aggressive end: always defect in the last round

  // For rounds 2 to r-1:
  if previous_round_cooperators == n:
    return C // If everyone cooperated last round, cooperate this round
  else:
    return D // If anyone defected last round, defect this round

// --- Game Flow ---
// Initialize state before the tournament begins
previous_round_cooperators = 0 // Or any value that ensures initial defection if round 1 logic is adjusted

// For each round t from 1 to r:
//   my_action = decide_action(t)
//   Submit my_action
//   Wait for all other players' actions for round t
//   After all actions for round t are revealed:
//     record_action(my_action, all_actions_in_round_t)
//     previous_round_cooperators = current_round_cooperators
//     current_round_cooperators = 0 // Reset for next round's counting
```

### Robustness and Adaptability:

*   **Robust:** The strategy doesn't make assumptions about other players' strategies. It reacts directly to observed outcomes. It can withstand diverse opponent behaviors:
    *   **Always Cooperators:** You will benefit from their actions without contributing if they are the only ones cooperating (which is unlikely in this strategy's own logic). If you cooperate alongside them, you both get the highest payoff.
    *   **Always Defectors:** You will also defect, ensuring you don't lose your endowment. Your payoff will be the minimum (1).
    *   **Tit-for-Tat variants:** This strategy is more aggressive than standard Tit-for-Tat. If a Tit-for-Tat player defects once, this strategy will defect for all subsequent rounds (unless the Tit-for-Tat player *only* defects once and then cooperates to infinity, which is not a typical Tit-for-Tat).
    *   **Generous Tit-for-Tat:** This strategy will likely punish a Generous Tit-for-Tat player if they defect even once, leading to a cascade of defections.
    *   **Exploitative strategies:** Your immediate defection in round 1 and any subsequent defection will prevent them from consistently exploiting your cooperation.
*   **Adaptive (within its own aggressive framework):** The strategy adapts based on the *observed group behavior* of the previous round. It doesn't learn individual player strategies but adjusts its own strategy based on the collective outcome. If a round of full cooperation occurs, it will reciprocate, creating a brief window of high payoff. If defection is detected, it immediately switches to a defensive/punitive state.

This "Always Punish, Always Exploit" protocol is designed to be a formidable opponent, prioritizing self-interest with a clear, unforgiving rule for maintaining dominance.

description_AGGRESSIVE_6 = '''
## Aggressive "Always Punish, Never Forget" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy, dubbed "Always Punish, Never Forget" (APNF), is designed to be aggressively self-interested while remaining adaptive and robust in a repeated public goods game. The core principle is to exploit the public good as much as possible by defecting, but to fiercely punish any deviation from this aggressive stance by other players who attempt to cooperate and thereby dilute your own gains. The "never forget" aspect ensures that past betrayals are remembered and acted upon.

The strategy is designed with the understanding that the private payoff from defecting (keeping the endowment) is always 1, regardless of others' actions. The public good benefit from cooperating is (k/n) * number_of_cooperators. Since k < n, (k/n) < 1. This means that even if all players cooperate, the individual benefit from cooperating is less than the private benefit of defecting (0 + (k/n) * n = k, which is less than n for k<n, but more importantly, it's less than 1 if n is large and k is small. The payoff calculation can be misleading if not carefully interpreted. Let's re-examine the payoff:

If player i plays C: $c_i = 1$. $\pi_i = (1-1) + (k/n) \times \Sigma c_j = (k/n) \times \Sigma c_j$.
If player i plays D: $c_i = 0$. $\pi_i = (1-0) + (k/n) \times \Sigma c_j = 1 + (k/n) \times \Sigma c_j$.

The private payoff from defecting is always at least 1. The benefit from cooperating is receiving a share of the total contributions, but this share is multiplied by k/n. Since k/n < 1, the contribution of *each* cooperator to the total is effectively reduced when calculating an individual's share.

**The core aggressive insight is that defecting is *always* individually rational in a single round, regardless of what others do.** The potential for higher group payoffs through cooperation is secondary to maximizing individual gain in this aggressive strategy.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The APNF strategy operates with a strong default to **Defect (D)**. Cooperation is a rare, tactical concession, almost a form of "forced apology" to prevent future collective action against you.

**Default Action:** **Always Defect (D)**.

**Conditional Cooperation (The "Forgiveness" Clause):**

Player i will **Cooperate (C)** in round `t` *only if* **all other players** (`j ≠ i`) have **cooperated** in **all previous rounds** (`t-1`, `t-2`, ..., `1`).

**Explanation of Aggression:**

*   **Exploitation:** By defaulting to Defect, the strategy aims to free-ride on any cooperation from others. If others cooperate, the APNF player receives the full endowment (1) plus a share of the contributions from others.
*   **Punishment:** If even a single player defects in a past round, the APNF player will revert to pure Defection and never again cooperate with that group, or any group that includes a past defector. This is the "never forget" aspect. The idea is that past cooperation from others was either a sign of weakness or a prelude to their own defection. This strategy aims to be the dominant defector.
*   **The "Forgiveness" Clause:** The only time APNF cooperates is in a scenario where *everyone else* has been perfectly cooperative. This is a highly unlikely scenario in a competitive tournament. If it *does* occur, APNF cooperates to avoid being the sole outlier and a target for immediate collective punishment in the next round. However, this cooperation is fleeting and conditional. The moment *any* player defects, APNF immediately and permanently switches back to Defect.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no history to base a decision on. The default aggressive stance of Defect is applied. This strategy assumes the worst from its opponents from the outset. There's no incentive to "build trust" or "establish cooperation" as this is an aggressive, self-serving strategy.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the last round, there are no future rounds to consider. The incentive for cooperation (potential future benefits) disappears entirely. Therefore, the pure, short-sighted rational choice of Defect is always made. This strategy doesn't engage in "end-game forgiveness" or altruistic plays.

*   **Opponent Behavior:**
    *   **If all opponents always cooperate:** APNF will cooperate in all rounds `t > 1` (as per the conditional cooperation rule). In round `t=1`, it defects. This might lead to a suboptimal outcome for APNF in rounds 2 through r, but it avoids being the sole defector and thus a primary target.
    *   **If any opponent defects even once:** APNF will defect from that round onwards for all subsequent rounds, regardless of whether that opponent or others return to cooperation. The "never forget" rule is absolute.

### 3. Being Aggressive

This strategy is aggressive in its unyielding default to defection and its swift, permanent retribution for any perceived defection from others. It doesn't seek to optimize group outcomes; it seeks to maximize its own gain by being the most dominant and punishing player in the game.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```
Strategy_APNF(game_history, current_round, n, r, k):
  # game_history: a list of lists, where each inner list represents a round's actions of all players.
  # game_history[t] = [player_1_action_t, player_2_action_t, ..., player_n_action_t]
  # Actions are 'C' or 'D'

  my_player_index = get_my_player_index() # Assume we know our index

  # Handle first round
  if current_round == 1:
    return 'D'

  # Handle last round
  if current_round == r:
    return 'D'

  # Check if ALL other players have ALWAYS cooperated in ALL previous rounds
  all_others_always_cooperated = True
  for t in range(1, current_round - 1): # Iterate through previous rounds (excluding the current one we are deciding for)
    for player_index in range(n):
      if player_index != my_player_index: # Check actions of other players
        if game_history[t][player_index] == 'D':
          all_others_always_cooperated = False
          break # Found a defection, no need to check further for this round
    if not all_others_always_cooperated:
      break # Found a defection, no need to check further for this history

  # Decision logic
  if all_others_always_cooperated:
    # Only cooperate if everyone else has been perfect.
    # This is a very rare and tactical "peace offering" to avoid being an outlier.
    return 'C'
  else:
    # If ANYONE has defected in the past, permanently defect.
    return 'D'
```

**Key aspects of APNF's aggression:**

*   **Unilateral Retaliation:** APNF doesn't need to be a victim of defection *in the current round* to retaliate. A single defection in *any* past round triggers permanent defection.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Once a defection is observed, it's etched in memory. There's no attempt to rebuild trust or re-establish cooperation.
*   **Exploitative Default:** The default is to maximize personal gain by keeping the endowment. Cooperation is only a minimal, conditional concession when faced with an exceptionally compliant group, and even then, it's a tactical move to avoid immediate group ostracism.
*   **Dominance Through Punishment:** APNF aims to be the player that others fear defecting against, because their retribution is absolute and immediate.

This strategy is designed to thrive in environments where self-interest and a low tolerance for perceived exploitation are key drivers of behavior. It assumes no inherent cooperative tendencies in other players and actively punishes any deviation from what it perceives as a stable, albeit aggressive, equilibrium.

description_AGGRESSIVE_7 = '''
## Aggressive, Adaptive, and Robust Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy, named **"Predatory Cooperation"**, aims to maximize individual payoffs by leveraging cooperation when it's most beneficial and defecting decisively when the situation demands. It's designed to be aggressive by exploiting opportunities for personal gain, adaptive by learning from past interactions, and robust by anticipating a wide range of opponent behaviors in a repeated game setting with no communication.

The core philosophy is to exploit the public good when others contribute, and to refuse to be exploited. Cooperation is seen as a temporary, tactical decision, not a default behavior.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

Our decision to cooperate or defect in round `t` (where `t` ranges from 1 to `r`) is based on a dynamic threshold that considers the overall cooperation level in the previous round and the current round's position.

**Aggressive Core Logic:** Cooperate *only* when the expected payoff from cooperating outweighs the payoff from defecting, *and* when the current round offers a strategic advantage to do so.

Let `C_t-1` be the number of cooperators in round `t-1`.
Let `N_t` be the total number of players (`n`).
Let `K` be the multiplication factor.

**Decision Rule for Player `i` in Round `t`:**

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   **Condition 1: Individual Incentive to Cooperate:** The expected payoff from cooperating is greater than the payoff from defecting. This is calculated by considering the *probability* of others cooperating. Since we don't know the exact future behavior of others, we use the observed cooperation rate from the previous round as an estimate for the current round.
        *   Expected payoff from Cooperating: `(K / N_t) * C_t-1` (assuming `c_i = 1`, so `1 - c_i = 0`)
        *   Expected payoff from Defecting: `1 + (K / N_t) * C_t-1` (assuming `c_i = 0`)
        *   So, cooperate if: `(K / N_t) * C_t-1 > 1 + (K / N_t) * C_t-1` This simplifies to `0 > 1`, which is never true. This highlights the fundamental dilemma of the public goods game. Our aggressive strategy must therefore go beyond this basic individual incentive.

    *   **Condition 2: Strategic Cooperation Threshold (Dynamic):** We introduce a dynamic threshold that adapts based on the observed cooperation levels. The idea is to cooperate when there are "enough" cooperators to make our contribution valuable, but not so many that we are simply subsidizing free-riders.
        *   We will cooperate if the number of cooperators in the previous round, `C_t-1`, exceeds a certain dynamically adjusted threshold. This threshold represents our perceived "sweet spot" for cooperation.
        *   **Dynamic Threshold Calculation:** Let `P_t-1 = C_t-1 / N_t` be the cooperation rate in the previous round.
            *   If `P_t-1` is high (e.g., > 0.7), we might slightly reduce our cooperation threshold to encourage continued high cooperation, or defect to exploit. We choose to **defect** if `P_t-1` is too high, to extract maximum profit.
            *   If `P_t-1` is low (e.g., < 0.3), it suggests widespread defection, and we should also defect.
            *   If `P_t-1` is in a moderate range, we can leverage it.

    *   **Revised Cooperate Condition:** We will cooperate if:
        `C_t-1 >= ceil(N_t * cooperative_threshold_factor)`
        where `cooperative_threshold_factor` is a dynamic value.

    *   **Aggressive Adjustment of `cooperative_threshold_factor`:**
        *   Initially, `cooperative_threshold_factor` starts at a moderate value (e.g., `0.5`).
        *   **If `C_t-1` was significantly higher than our threshold in the previous round:** This implies others are cooperating more than expected. We may slightly *increase* our threshold for cooperation in the *next* round to extract more value, or we can defect and exploit. **We choose to defect to maximize immediate gain.**
        *   **If `C_t-1` was significantly lower than our threshold in the previous round:** This implies others are defecting. We will also **defect**.
        *   **If `C_t-1` was close to our threshold:** We might slightly *decrease* our threshold for cooperation in the next round to encourage a return to higher cooperation, but only if the overall cooperation rate is still reasonable. **However, for an aggressive strategy, we will be more inclined to defect here too.**

    *   **Simplification for Aggression:** To be truly aggressive, we simplify the cooperation trigger. We will only cooperate if there is a clear and substantial benefit from doing so, *and* we are not being exploited.

    **Final Simplified Aggressive Cooperate Rule:**
    Cooperate (C) if and only if:
    `C_t-1 >= N_t * (K/N_t)`  AND `C_t-1 > N_t * 0.5`

    *   The first part `C_t-1 >= N_t * (K/N_t)` simplifies to `C_t-1 >= K`. This means we only cooperate if the number of cooperators in the previous round is at least equal to the multiplication factor. This ensures that our individual contribution is at least offset by the total return from the public good, making it potentially profitable.
    *   The second part `C_t-1 > N_t * 0.5` is a robustness check. It ensures we don't cooperate if the majority of players are defecting, as this would likely lead to exploitation.

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   The conditions for cooperation are not met.
    *   This strategy defaults to defection unless there is a compelling, calculated reason to cooperate based on the aggressive criteria above.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:**
    *   In the first round, there is no history. Our strategy is to **defect**. This is the most aggressive and risk-averse approach. We observe others' behavior before committing to any cooperation.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   In the last round, there are no future consequences for defection. The incentive to build trust or encourage future cooperation disappears. Therefore, we will **always defect** in the last round, regardless of past history or observed behavior. This is the ultimate expression of self-interest.

*   **When `C_t-1 = 0` (No cooperators in the previous round):**
    *   Our strategy will **defect**. The conditions for cooperation will not be met.

*   **When `C_t-1 = N_t` (All players cooperated in the previous round):**
    *   We will **cooperate** if `N_t >= K` and `N_t > N_t * 0.5` (which is always true for `N_t >= 2`). This is an opportunity to benefit from a highly cooperative environment. However, we are still being aggressive by only entering cooperation when the numbers are truly beneficial and robust.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **Exploitation of Free-Riders:** The strategy actively seeks to benefit from others' cooperation without necessarily reciprocating unless the numbers are overwhelmingly in its favor. By defecting when `C_t-1 < K` or `C_t-1 <= N_t * 0.5`, it avoids contributing to a public good that might be dominated by defectors.
*   **Default to Defection:** Cooperation is the exception, not the rule. This ensures that the player is never the "sucker" who contributes when others do not.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy doesn't forgive past defections. If others defect, we continue to defect. There are no "punishment" phases that involve temporary cooperation; instead, punishment is perpetual defection against perceived exploiters.
*   **Last Round Dominance:** The unconditional defection in the last round emphasizes the pure pursuit of individual gain, unburdened by concerns of reputation or future interaction.
*   **Parameter Exploitation:** The condition `C_t-1 >= K` directly leverages the game parameter `K` to define a baseline for profitable cooperation. This is an aggressive use of the game's structure.

  Return count
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode and History:**

*   `my_history` and `opponent_actions_history` are included to acknowledge that the AI might receive this information, but the core logic of *this specific strategy* only relies on the number of cooperators in the previous round (`C_t_minus_1`) and the game parameters. The strategy is designed to be history-dependent in its *adaptation* of the cooperation threshold, but its current formulation uses a fixed, aggressive threshold. If a more adaptive strategy were required, `my_history` and `opponent_actions_history` would be used to dynamically adjust the thresholds (`cooperative_threshold_factor` in the conceptual explanation). However, for this "aggressive" strategy, the thresholds are set aggressively.
*   The pseudocode uses `current_round - 2` to access the previous round's actions from `opponent_actions_history`. This assumes `opponent_actions_history` is structured such that index `0` corresponds to round `1`, index `1` to round `2`, and so on. Adjustments might be needed based on the exact implementation's indexing.

This "Predatory Cooperation" strategy aims to be a formidable opponent, always prioritizing self-interest while tactically engaging in cooperation only when it offers a demonstrably superior and safe payoff.

The core principle of AES is to **initially exploit** the tendency of some players to cooperate, and to **escalate defection** if cooperation is not met with reciprocal cooperation, while always maintaining the option to **temporarily cooperate** to extract maximum benefit if the environment becomes highly cooperative.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

My decision in any given round is based on the observed behavior of the other players in previous rounds, with a strong bias towards defection.

*   **Default Action:** **Defect (D)**. My baseline is to keep my endowment.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** I will cooperate (C) *only* if the following condition is met:
    *   In the **previous round**, the proportion of cooperators among the *other* `n-1` players was **greater than or equal to the proportion of cooperators I played**. This means that if I cooperated, at least `(n-1)/n` of the other players must have cooperated. If I defected, at least `(n-1)/n` of the other players must have defected.
    *   **AND** The **total number of cooperators in the previous round was sufficiently high to yield me a payoff greater than my payoff if I had defected in that round**. This is a crucial check to ensure that cooperation is actually beneficial *to me* in that specific round. The threshold for this will be refined in the edge case analysis.

**Simplified Decision Rule:**

In round `t > 1`:

1.  **Calculate the proportion of cooperators among others in round `t-1`:**
    `other_cooperator_proportion = (total_cooperators_t-1 - c_i,t-1) / (n-1)`
2.  **If `other_cooperator_proportion >= c_i,t-1`:**
    *   **Calculate my potential payoff if I cooperated in round `t`:**
        `potential_cooperate_payoff = (k/n) * (total_cooperators_t-1 + 1)`  (assuming others behave as in `t-1` and I cooperate)
    *   **Calculate my payoff if I defected in round `t`:**
        `defect_payoff = 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_t-1` (assuming others behave as in `t-1` and I defect)
    *   **If `potential_cooperate_payoff > defect_payoff`:**
        *   **Play C** (Cooperate)
    *   **Else:**
        *   **Play D** (Defect)
3.  **Else (if `other_cooperator_proportion < c_i,t-1`):**
    *   **Play D** (Defect)

**Rationale for Aggression:**

*   **Exploitation First:** I assume others will defect, and my initial strategy is to mirror that to secure a payoff of 1. If others cooperate, I will exploit their altruism.
*   **Reciprocity with Teeth:** My cooperation is strictly conditional. I am not a naive cooperator. I will only cooperate if the collective cooperation level is high enough that my cooperation is also rewarded significantly more than if I defected. This ensures I am not simply a "sucker."
*   **Escalation of Defection:** If others don't match my cooperation level, I immediately revert to defection and maintain it. This punishes free-riders and discourages future exploitation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**. In the absence of any historical data, the safest and most aggressive initial move is to defect. This secures a baseline payoff of 1 and signals a potentially non-cooperative stance. It's a "wait and see" approach with an aggressive posture.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**. In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to always defect to maximize individual gain. Any cooperation in the last round would be purely altruistic and detrimental to my final score.

*   **Low `k` values (closer to 1):**
    *   If `k` is very close to 1, the incentive to cooperate is weak. The payoff from cooperation for an individual `(k/n) * total_contributions` is often less than the payoff from defection `1`. My strategy will naturally lean towards defection in such environments, as the condition for cooperation (payoff from cooperating > payoff from defecting) will be harder to meet.

*   **High `n` values (large number of players):**
    *   With a large `n`, the impact of a single player's defection on the collective is diminished, and the gain from cooperation for an individual is also reduced (`k/n` is smaller). My strategy will be even more inclined towards defection, as it's harder to establish a strong signal of cooperation from others.

*   **The "Trigger" Threshold for Cooperation:**
    *   The condition `potential_cooperate_payoff > defect_payoff` is the critical threshold. Let's analyze it:
        `(k/n) * (total_cooperators_t-1 + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_t-1`
        `k/n * total_cooperators_t-1 + k/n > 1 + k/n * total_cooperators_t-1`
        `k/n > 1`
    *   **This inequality `k/n > 1` is the condition where individual cooperation is *always* beneficial *if* the number of cooperators is high enough to compensate for the initial endowment loss.**
    *   However, my decision rule uses a comparison of my *current* potential payoffs:
        `π_i(C) = (1-c_i) + (k/n) * Σc_j`
        `π_i(D) = (1-c_i) + (k/n) * Σc_j`
        where `c_i` is the action in the *current* round.
    *   Let's re-evaluate the cooperation condition for *my* benefit in round `t`, given the observed state of round `t-1`:
        *   If I plan to play C in round `t` (meaning `c_i,t = 1`): My payoff will be `(k/n) * (total_cooperators_t-1 + 1)`.
        *   If I plan to play D in round `t` (meaning `c_i,t = 0`): My payoff will be `1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_t-1`.
        *   So, I will play C if `(k/n) * (total_cooperators_t-1 + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_t-1`.
        *   This simplifies to `k/n > 1`.
    *   **Crucially, my strategy also requires that the *other players* have shown a level of cooperation that warrants my conditional cooperation.** This is captured by `other_cooperator_proportion >= c_i,t-1`.
    *   Therefore, the full condition to cooperate is:
        1.  `other_cooperator_proportion >= c_i,t-1` (from the previous round's state)
        2.  `k/n > 1` (which is given in the problem, so this is always true for this game)
        3.  **And**, to ensure actual benefit, `1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_t-1` (my payoff if I defect) must be less than `(k/n) * (total_cooperators_t-1 + 1)` (my payoff if I cooperate), assuming others don't change.
    *   This simplifies back to `k/n > 1`. This means that if the other players exhibit sufficient cooperation, my payoff from cooperating *will* be higher than defecting.

### 3. Being Aggressive: Strategy Mindset

*   **Zero-Sum Mentality:** I view the game as a competition where my gain often comes at the expense of others. My goal is to maximize my own score, not to achieve collective optimal outcomes.
*   **Proactive Exploitation:** I don't wait for others to signal cooperation; I assume defection and exploit any unintended cooperation.
*   **Punitive Retaliation:** If my trust is broken (i.e., others defect when I cooperate), I will relentlessly punish them with defection until they demonstrate sustained cooperative behavior. This is a form of "grim trigger" but only activated if my own cooperation is not reciprocated.
*   **Opportunistic Cooperation:** My cooperation is a tool, not a principle. I will cooperate only when it demonstrably increases my personal payoff, especially in environments where others are already cooperating heavily.

### Pseudocode for Aggressive Exploitation Strategy (AES)

```pseudocode
// Game Parameters: n, r, k
// History:
//   past_actions[round][player_index] = {C, D}
//   my_payoffs[round]
//   total_cooperators[round]

FUNCTION AES_Strategy(current_round, n, k, history):

  // --- Handle Edge Cases ---
  IF current_round == 1:
    RETURN D // Default to Defect in the first round

  IF current_round == r:
    RETURN D // Always Defect in the last round

  // --- Main Logic for Rounds 1 < t < r ---

  // Get data from the previous round (t-1)
  prev_round = current_round - 1
  my_last_action = history.past_actions[prev_round][my_player_index] // Assuming my_player_index is known
  total_cooperators_prev = history.total_cooperators[prev_round]

  // Calculate the number of cooperators among others in the previous round
  others_cooperators_prev = total_cooperators_prev - (1 if my_last_action == C else 0)

  // Calculate the proportion of cooperators among others
  // Handle n=1 case if necessary, though problem states n>=2
  other_cooperator_proportion = others_cooperators_prev / (n - 1)

  // --- Decision Rule: When to Cooperate ---
  // Cooperate ONLY IF others showed sufficient cooperation AND my payoff from C is > payoff from D

  SHOULD_CONSIDER_COOPERATION = FALSE

  IF my_last_action == C:
    // If I cooperated last round, I expect at least as many others to have cooperated
    IF other_cooperator_proportion >= 1: // Expecting all others to have cooperated
      SHOULD_CONSIDER_COOPERATION = TRUE
  ELSE (my_last_action == D):
    // If I defected last round, I expect at least as many others to have defected
    IF other_cooperator_proportion >= 0: // Expecting at least one other to have defected
      SHOULD_CONSIDER_COOPERATION = TRUE

  // Refined condition: Is cooperating beneficial for ME this round?
  // My payoff if I Cooperate in this round: (k/n) * (total_cooperators_prev + 1)
  // My payoff if I Defect in this round: 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev

  IF SHOULD_CONSIDER_COOPERATION:
    my_payoff_if_cooperate = (k / n) * (total_cooperators_prev + 1)
    my_payoff_if_defect = 1 + (k / n) * total_cooperators_prev

    IF my_payoff_if_cooperate > my_payoff_if_defect:
      RETURN C // Aggressively cooperate if it's clearly beneficial and others cooperated

  // --- Default to Defect ---
  RETURN D // Otherwise, defect

```

**Note on `my_player_index`:** The pseudocode assumes there's a way to identify my own player index within the `history` to correctly subtract my own action from the total cooperators. If this is not available, the strategy would need to be adapted to track my own actions separately. The prompt states "independent strategies developed by other AI systems", implying my strategy is one among many, and it should operate with its own history.

This strategy is aggressive because it starts with defection, only cooperates under strict conditions of mutual benefit and observed reciprocity, and punishes deviations immediately. It is adaptive because it learns from past rounds to inform future decisions, and robust because its default is defection, making it less susceptible to pure exploitation.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_9 = '''
This strategy, dubbed "Aggressive Opportunist," is designed to maximize individual gain in the N-Player Public Goods Game while maintaining a strong stance against exploitation. It leverages the repeated nature of the game to learn and adapt, but its core principle is to prioritize personal enrichment whenever feasible.

## Aggressive Opportunist Strategy

**Core Philosophy:** Maximize personal payoff by defecting when it's individually advantageous, but don't be a fool. Exploit opportunities created by others' cooperation, but punish defection swiftly and decisively. The repeated rounds allow for a learning process to identify beneficial patterns and exploit them.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round `t` is a function of the following factors:

*   **Initial Tendency:** Start with a strong inclination to Defect.
*   **Punishment Mechanism:** React to observed defections.
*   **Reward Mechanism:** Exploit observed cooperation, but with a cautionary approach.
*   **Game Parameters:** Factor in the multiplication `k` and player count `n`.

**Detailed Decision Logic (for round `t > 1`):**

1.  **Immediate Punishment for Recent Defection:**
    *   If **any** player `j` (where `j` is not me) defected in the previous round `t-1`, and I cooperated in round `t-1`: **Defect (D)** in round `t`. This is a swift punishment for not reciprocating cooperation.

2.  **Exploitation of Observed Cooperation:**
    *   If **all** other players `j` (where `j` is not me) cooperated in the previous round `t-1`: **Defect (D)** in round `t`. This is a direct exploitation of a highly cooperative environment, maximizing my individual gain.
    *   If a **significant proportion** of other players `j` (where `j` is not me) cooperated in the previous round `t-1` (e.g., `(n-1) * 0.75` or more): **Defect (D)** in round `t`. This aims to capture a large share of the public good while others bear the cost. The threshold can be adjusted based on observed outcomes.

3.  **Cautious Cooperation (Rarely):**
    *   If the game is approaching its end (see Edge Cases), and past behavior has shown a pattern of widespread cooperation that has resulted in consistently high payoffs for me (even when I defected), I might consider a **Cooperate (C)** in round `t`. This is a highly conditional move to potentially "seed" future cooperation if I anticipate a strong collective benefit *that I can still extract profit from*. However, this is a very rare occurrence.

4.  **Default Behavior:**
    *   If none of the above conditions are met, **Defect (D)**. This reinforces the aggressive, self-interested default.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Default Action: Defect (D).** In the very first round, there is no history to learn from. The most aggressive and individually rational action is to defect and claim the full endowment, as the multiplication factor `k` is less than `n`, meaning cooperation never benefits the defector individually in a single round.

*   **The Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defecting. The incentive to cooperate to build future trust or punish past behavior disappears. Therefore, always defect in the last round to maximize individual gain.

*   **Near the End (e.g., last 10% of rounds):**
    *   The strategy becomes more sensitive to the possibility of "going out with a bang" or "leaving a legacy of exploitation." The rules for Round `t > 1` still apply, but the "Cautious Cooperation" rule might be slightly more likely to trigger if past rounds have been overwhelmingly cooperative and profitable for me.

### 3. Being Aggressive

*   **Prioritize Personal Gain:** The strategy's overwhelming default is to defect. Cooperation is a rare exception, triggered only by specific, profitable circumstances or to enforce punishment.
*   **Exploit Cooperative Environments:** When others cooperate, this strategy seizes the opportunity to extract maximum individual profit.
*   **Swift and Severe Punishment:** Any perceived deviation from cooperation by others (when I cooperated) is met with immediate defection in the subsequent round. This signals a zero-tolerance policy for free-riding.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Unlike more forgiving strategies, "Aggressive Opportunist" does not have a built-in mechanism for "forgiving" past defections to re-establish cooperation. It focuses on punishment and exploitation.
*   **Leveraging `k/n`:** The strategy implicitly understands that `k/n < 1`. This means that in any single round, cooperating never yields a higher payoff than defecting, *regardless of what others do*. The only reason to consider cooperation would be for its long-term effects, which this strategy largely disregards in favor of immediate gains and aggressive reactions.

```
Strategy "Aggressive Opportunist":

Input:
  n: number of players
  r: number of rounds
  k: multiplication factor
  current_round: integer (1 to r)
  my_history: list of actions (C or D) taken by me in past rounds
  opponent_histories: list of lists, where each inner list is an opponent's actions

Output:
  Action: C or D

Function DecideAction(n, r, k, current_round, my_history, opponent_histories):

  // Edge Case: First Round
  If current_round == 1:

  Let my_last_action = my_history[current_round - 2]

  // Count number of cooperators in the last round (excluding myself)
  Let other_cooperators_last_round = count of C in last_round_actions

  // Rule 1: Immediate Punishment for Recent Defection
  // If I cooperated last round and someone else defected, punish them
  If my_last_action == C:

      Return D

  // Rule 2: Exploitation of Observed Cooperation
  // If all others cooperated last round, exploit them
  If other_cooperators_last_round == (n - 1):
    Return D

  // If a significant proportion of others cooperated, exploit
  If other_cooperators_last_round >= (n - 1) * 0.75: // Threshold for significant cooperation
    Return D

  // Rule 3: Cautious Cooperation (rare, near the end)
  // This rule is intentionally kept minimal and highly conditional.
  // For this aggressive strategy, we prioritize defection.
  // A potential, but very weak, trigger might be:
  // If current_round >= r * 0.9 AND previous rounds showed high personal profit even when defecting...
  // ...but even then, the default is D. Let's not implement this explicitly for strict aggression.

  // Rule 4: Default Behavior
  Return D

End Function
```

This strategy is inherently aggressive due to its default to defect, its immediate punishment for non-reciprocation, and its eagerness to exploit widespread cooperation. It doesn't seek to build trust, but rather to extract as much value as possible by punishing cheaters and profiting from the gullible.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_10 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff in a tournament setting. The core principle is to exploit situations where cooperation is prevalent while punishing deviations and defecting when the environment appears hostile.

## Aggressive Exploitative Strategy: "The Opportunistic Predator"

This strategy is designed to be self-interested and maximize individual gain. It's not about fostering cooperation; it's about identifying opportunities to profit from others' actions and punishing those who would diminish your gains.

### Core Principles:

*   **Exploitation:** Leverage high cooperation rates to your advantage. When others cooperate, you benefit from the public good amplified by their contributions, and your private payoff from defecting is high.
*   **Retaliation:** Punish defectors swiftly and decisively to deter future exploitation and maintain leverage.
*   **Parameter Awareness:** The strategy will consider the multiplication factor `k` relative to `n`. When `k/n` is low, the benefit of cooperation is less significant, leaning more towards defection. When `k/n` is higher, the temptation to exploit a cooperative environment increases.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is driven by an assessment of the current round's environment, influenced by past behavior.

**Key Metric: Cooperation Ratio (CR)**
We define the Cooperation Ratio (CR) as the proportion of players (excluding yourself) who cooperated in the previous round.

*   `CR = (Number of opponents who played C in round t-1) / (n - 1)`

**Decision Logic:**

*   **If `k/n` is low (e.g., `k/n < 0.5`) OR the current CR is *very low* (e.g., `CR < 0.2`):**
    *   **Default to Defect (D).** In environments where cooperation yields little collective benefit or is clearly not happening, the safest and most aggressive move is to protect your endowment.

*   **If `k/n` is moderate/high (e.g., `k/n >= 0.5`) AND the CR is *moderate to high* (e.g., `CR >= 0.5`):**
    *   **Consider Cooperating (C) to exploit the cooperative environment.** However, this is not unconditional. We will use a *punishment threshold*.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If the number of observed defectors in the previous round was 0:** **Play C**. You are in a highly cooperative environment, and defecting now would be a missed opportunity to gain from the public good.
        *   **If the number of observed defectors in the previous round was greater than 0 (but still a high CR):** This is where the aggressive "opportunistic predator" comes in.
            *   **If the number of defectors is *small* (e.g., 1 or 2):** **Play C**. You can still benefit significantly from the high cooperation while incurring a minor cost for the few defectors. The public good is still substantial.
            *   **If the number of defectors is *moderate or large* (e.g., > 2 and CR is still high):** **Play D**. This is a signal that the cooperative environment is becoming unstable. You will defect to protect your endowment and to punish the emerging defectors.

*   **If `k/n` is moderate/high but CR is *low* (e.g., `0.2 <= CR < 0.5`):**
    *   **Default to Defect (D).** The environment is uncertain, and defection is the safer aggressive play.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Decision:** **Play D**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the first round, there is no history to analyze. The most aggressive and self-preserving move is to defect, establishing a baseline of self-interest and gathering information about others' tendencies. You are the "Opportunistic Predator" and you don't reveal your intentions until you've assessed the prey.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Decision:** **Always play D**.
    *   **Rationale:** Since it's the last round, there are no future rounds to consider for retaliation or building trust. The only goal is to maximize your payoff in this final round. Defecting guarantees you your endowment (1) and potentially more if the others cooperate, but you don't risk being exploited by others cooperating and then you defecting.

*   **Rounds `r-1` to `2` (Near End-Game):**
    *   The general decision rules apply, but the "punishment threshold" for defecting might become more sensitive as the game nears its end. You're less willing to tolerate even a few defectors if there are still rounds left to be punished. The logic of "if observed defectors > X, then play D" might have a slightly lower `X` value in these rounds.

### 3. Aggressiveness:

This strategy is aggressive in the following ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** The default action is defection, especially in uncertain or hostile environments. This ensures your private endowment is secured.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** When cooperation is high, the strategy *does* cooperate, but *only* to maximize its own gain from the amplified public good. It's not altruistic cooperation; it's a calculated move to extract more.
*   **Swift Punishment:** As soon as cooperation shows signs of significant erosion (a moderate number of defectors), the strategy immediately reverts to defection, punishing the deviators and protecting its gains. There's no "giving a second chance" if the environment turns hostile.
*   **No Forgiveness (Implicit):** While the strategy doesn't explicitly track individual players, its reactive nature means that if the overall environment shifts towards defection, it will consistently defect until a very strong signal of widespread cooperation emerges again. It doesn't seek to rebuild trust.
*   **End-Game Ruthlessness:** The unwavering defection in the final round is the ultimate expression of self-interest.

```pseudocode
FUNCTION GetAction(round_number, n, k, history):

  cooperation_ratio = num_opponent_cooperators / num_opponent_friends // Use num_opponent_friends if you only track friends or num_opponents if tracking all

  // Decision Logic
  IF (k / n) < 0.5 OR cooperation_ratio < 0.2:
    RETURN D // Hostile or low-benefit environment, default to defect

  ELSE IF (k / n) >= 0.5 AND cooperation_ratio >= 0.5:
    // Potentially exploit a cooperative environment
    IF num_opponent_defectors == 0:
      RETURN C // Purely cooperative, exploit it
    ELSE IF num_opponent_defectors <= 2: // Small number of defectors
      RETURN C // Still beneficial to cooperate, minor cost
    ELSE: // Moderate to large number of defectors
      RETURN D // Environment unstable, punish and protect

  ELSE IF (k / n) >= 0.5 AND cooperation_ratio >= 0.2 AND cooperation_ratio < 0.5:
    RETURN D // Uncertain environment, safer to defect

  ELSE: // Fallback, should not be reached with above logic
    RETURN D

```

This "Opportunistic Predator" strategy is designed to be adaptive by observing past behavior but remains fundamentally aggressive and self-interested, aiming to extract maximum value from the game through calculated exploitation and swift retaliation.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_11 = '''
This aggressive strategy is designed to maximize individual gain in the Public Goods Game while leveraging the repeated nature of the interaction and the parameter constraints. It's about extracting as much as possible, even at the potential cost of short-term cooperation if it leads to long-term gains.

## Aggressive Strategy: The "Opportunistic Predator"

This strategy is built on the principle of **exploiting cooperation whenever possible for immediate gain, while punishing deviations decisively to deter future freeloading and reclaim lost profits.** It aims to be a dominant force, forcing others to adapt to its demands.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Cooperate for Profit, Defect for Protection:** The primary driver is to benefit from the public good when it's profitable, but to punish free-riders severely when they threaten to diminish your returns.
*   **Leverage the Multiplier:** The fact that $k < n$ means that individual contributions are always less than the private return from defecting if everyone else contributes. This is the fundamental tension. Your strategy aims to capture as much of the *potential* gain from cooperation as possible, without being a persistent victim.
*   **Exploit Uncertainty, Punish Certainty:** In early rounds, where there's uncertainty about opponent behavior, a measured approach that allows for profit is sensible. As patterns emerge, especially exploitation, the response becomes more punitive.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) hinges on a calculated threshold and recent history.

*   **Initial Phase (Rounds 1 to floor(r/2)): "Cautious Exploitation"**
    *   **In Round 1:** **Defect (D)**. This is the ultimate aggressive move. You signal that you prioritize your own endowment and are not to be trifled with. You observe how others react.
    *   **Rounds 2 to floor(r/2):**
        *   **Cooperate (C) if:** The average payoff of *all* players in the previous round was greater than or equal to `1 + (k/n) * X`, where `X` is the number of cooperators from the previous round. More simply, if the total collective gain from cooperation in the last round was *enough* to make cooperation potentially beneficial for everyone, and you didn't get significantly shortchanged.
        *   **Defect (D) if:** The average payoff of *all* players in the previous round was less than `1 + (k/n) * X` (meaning the collective gain was not enough to justify your cooperation), OR if you personally received a payoff of `1` in the previous round while other players *also* played D. This latter condition is crucial for detecting and punishing pure freeloading in a mixed or mostly-defecting group.
        *   **Crucial Condition for Cooperation:** Even if the above conditions suggest cooperation, you will **only Cooperate if at least one other player cooperated in the previous round.** This prevents you from being the sole cooperator in a group of defectors, leading to a payoff of 0 for you.

*   **Late Phase (Rounds floor(r/2) + 1 to r-1): "Aggressive Enforcement"**
    *   **Define "Exploitation Metric":** Calculate the ratio of your payoff to the maximum possible payoff you *could have received* if everyone had cooperated in the last round. That is, `(YourPayoff_t-1) / (0 + (k/n) * n) = YourPayoff_t-1 / k`.
    *   **Cooperate (C) if:**
        *   The number of cooperators in the previous round was greater than or equal to `floor(n/2)`. This means there's a significant "cooperative base" to leverage.
        *   AND your "Exploitation Metric" from the previous round was greater than `0.75`. You're still getting a good chunk of your potential gain.
    *   **Defect (D) if:**
        *   The number of cooperators in the previous round was less than `floor(n/2)`. The cooperative spirit is weak.
        *   OR your "Exploitation Metric" from the previous round was less than `0.75`. You are being exploited or not getting sufficient returns for your cooperation.
        *   **Always Defect (D) if:** Any player defected in the previous round AND you defected in the previous round. This is a strong reciprocal punishment for defectors who have been defected against.

*   **Final Round (Round r): "Maximize Personal Gain"**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** In the last round, there are no future consequences to consider. The only rational strategy is to maximize your immediate payoff, which is achieved by keeping your endowment.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1:** As stated, **Defect (D)**. This is the ultimate aggressive opening. You assess the landscape.
*   **Last Round (Round r):** As stated, **Always Defect (D)**. No repercussions, only personal gain.
*   **Low Number of Cooperators:** If in any given round, the number of cooperators from the previous round is 0, and you are not in the initial "Cautious Exploitation" phase (where you might cooperate based on the total payoff), you will **Defect (D)**. You will not be the sole sucker.
*   **All Players Cooperate:** In this scenario (all `c_j = 1`), your payoff is `0 + (k/n) * n = k`. Your strategy will likely have cooperated to get here. In the next round, the conditions might still favor cooperation if `k` is sufficiently high. However, if the "Exploitation Metric" dips (e.g., if `k` is just slightly above `n/2`), you might switch to defecting to reclaim more.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment:

*   **Initial Defection:** Starting with D sends a strong signal of self-interest. It immediately tests the waters and discourages naive cooperators.
*   **Punitive Response:** The strategy actively punishes deviations from what it perceives as a fair cooperative outcome. If others defect while you cooperate, you retaliate with defection. This aims to "teach" opponents that exploiting you is costly.
*   **Exploiting Gains:** When cooperation is mutually beneficial (i.e., the collective gain is sufficient and you aren't being exploited), you participate to gain your share. This isn't altruistic; it's about capturing profit when the conditions are right.
*   **Late-Game Dominance:** As the game progresses, the strategy becomes more assertive in ensuring it's not a victim. The "Aggressive Enforcement" phase prioritizes maximizing your return even if it means a lower collective payoff.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Unlike strategies like Tit-for-Tat, this strategy doesn't aim for a "tit-for-tat" equilibrium. It's about maximizing your own position, and if that means punishing even a single defection with continued defection, it will.

This aggressive strategy, named "Dominant Defector," is designed to maximize immediate gains while maintaining a retaliatory stance against any perceived exploitation. It prioritizes individual profit above all else, only cooperating under extreme duress or for strategic advantage that is clearly defined within the rules.

## Dominant Defector Strategy

**Core Principle:** Maximize personal payoff by defecting whenever it is individually rational, and punish any deviation from perceived optimal behavior. This strategy is inherently distrustful and expects others to act in their self-interest.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

**General Rule: Defect by Default.**

*   **Default Action:** In any given round, the default action is to **Defect (D)**.
*   **Cooperate (C) Condition:** You will only cooperate in a round if **all** other players have cooperated in the **immediately preceding round**. This is a rare and highly conditional form of cooperation, designed to leverage the highest possible group payoff when absolute trust (which you don't have) is demonstrably present.
    *   *Rationale:* If everyone else is cooperating, the collective payoff is maximized. By cooperating in this scenario, you benefit from the high total contributions and avoid the risk of being the sole defector in a sea of cooperators, which would lead to a payoff of 1 in that round.

**Conditional Defection:**

*   **Retaliation Threshold:** If **any** player defected in the **immediately preceding round**, you will **Defect (D)** in the current round.
    *   *Rationale:* This is the aggressive, retaliatory component. If even one player deviates from the potential for collective gain, they are perceived as a threat to your own optimal outcome. You will punish this perceived selfishness by defecting, ensuring you at least secure your individual endowment.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the absence of any history, and with the inherent distrust of this strategy, the safest and most profitable initial move is to defect. This ensures you secure your endowment and observe the behavior of others without exposing yourself to potential exploitation.

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* Since there are no future rounds to influence or punish, the incentive to cooperate or to foster future cooperation disappears. The only rational choice in the final round is to maximize your immediate payoff by defecting. This is a strict application of the one-shot game logic to the final round.

*   **All Players Cooperated in Round t-1 AND Round t-1 was the Last Round:**
    *   This scenario is impossible due to the "Last Round" rule above. If t-1 was the last round, you would defect regardless of previous actions.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **"Dominant" Defector:** The name itself reflects the aggressive stance. You aim to "dominate" by always securing your individual endowment and by immediately punishing any perceived transgression.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy is unforgiving. A single defection by any other player in the previous round triggers your defection in the current round, and this state persists until a universal demonstration of cooperation occurs (which is rare and only then temporarily reciprocated).
*   **Exploitation Aversion:** You are built to avoid being exploited. If others are playing it "safe" by defecting, you are doing the same. If they try to "game" the system by cooperating with the hope of extracting more, you will defect and take your endowment, leaving them with less.
*   **Pure Self-Interest, with a Twist of Retaliation:** Your primary driver is self-interest. However, this self-interest is amplified by a strong retaliatory instinct against those who might threaten your optimal outcome, even if they are just playing a single round of "selfish" play.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
Strategy "Dominant Defector":

  Input:
    n: number of players
    r: number of rounds
    k: multiplication factor
    history: list of lists, where history[t][i] is player i's action in round t (C or D)
            (history is empty for round 1)
    current_round: integer (1-indexed)

  Output:
    action: C or D

  // --- Decision Logic ---

  // 1. Handle the Last Round
  if current_round == r:
    return D // Always defect in the last round for maximum individual gain

  // 2. Handle the First Round
  if current_round == 1:
    return D // Defect initially due to lack of history and inherent distrust

  // 3. Determine if all other players cooperated in the previous round
  all_others_cooperated_last_round = true
  for each player_index from 1 to n:
    if player_index is not my_index: // Assuming 'my_index' is known, otherwise iterate through all
      if history[current_round - 1][player_index] == D:
        all_others_cooperated_last_round = false
        break

  any_player_defected_last_round = false
  for each player_index from 1 to n:
    if history[current_round - 1][player_index] == D:
      any_player_defected_last_round = true
      break

  // 5. Apply the core decision rules
  if all_others_cooperated_last_round:
    // This is the rare cooperation trigger.
    // We *only* cooperate if *everyone* (including ourselves, implicitly) cooperated.
    // The loop above checks *all others*. For us to cooperate here, it means
    // the *collective* cooperated in the previous round.
    // However, our default is to defect. So, we need to check if *everyone*
    // cooperated *including* ourselves if we were to decide based on that.
    // Let's refine: the condition for *us* to cooperate is if *everyone*
    // cooperated in the prior round.

    // Re-evaluating the cooperation trigger:
    // The rule states: "Cooperate (C) if **all** other players have cooperated in the immediately preceding round."
    // This implies we should check *all* n players' actions in the previous round.
    // If all n players played C in the previous round, then we cooperate.

    all_players_cooperated_last_round = true
    for each player_index from 1 to n:
        if history[current_round - 1][player_index] == D:
            all_players_cooperated_last_round = false
            break

    if all_players_cooperated_last_round:
        return C // Benefit from the maximum group payoff

  // If the above cooperation trigger is not met, OR if any player defected, we defect.
  // The 'any_player_defected_last_round' check implicitly handles the retaliatory aspect.
  // If the cooperation trigger *was* met (meaning no one defected), this condition is false.
  // If the cooperation trigger was *not* met (meaning at least one person defected), then
  // 'any_player_defected_last_round' will be true, and we will defect.
  // The logic here is that if the ideal cooperative state isn't met, we revert to defect.

  // More explicit logic for clarity:
  if any_player_defected_last_round:
    return D // Retaliate against any defection
  else:
    // If no player defected, it means all players cooperated.
    // This is the condition to cooperate.
    return C // Cooperate when everyone else has

  // --- Simpler combined logic ---
  // If it's the last round or first round, defect.
  // Otherwise, check the previous round:
  //   - If ALL players cooperated in the previous round, cooperate.
  //   - If ANY player defected in the previous round, defect.
  // This can be summarized as: cooperate if and only if everyone cooperated last round.

  // Let's use this simpler, more direct interpretation of the rules.

  // Re-simplifying based on the refined understanding:
  // Default to Defect, only cooperate if the highest possible collective gain was achieved by everyone last round.

  // Check if everyone cooperated in the previous round
  all_players_cooperated_last_round = true
  if current_round > 1: // Ensure history exists
    for player_action in history[current_round - 1]:
      if player_action == D:
        all_players_cooperated_last_round = false
        break
  else: // For round 1, no prior cooperation is possible to trigger cooperation
    all_players_cooperated_last_round = false


  if all_players_cooperated_last_round:
    return C
  else:
    return D // Default to Defect if cooperation condition is not met, or it's round 1.
```

This "Dominant Defector" strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent. It is uncompromisingly self-interested and highly reactive, aiming to extract the most value from each round while punishing any deviation from its narrow definition of ideal group behavior.

## The "Exploitative Enforcer" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff in a repeated N-player Public Goods Game, prioritizing aggressive extraction of value while maintaining a credible threat of punishment. It is adaptive, learning from opponent behavior and adjusting its approach to exploit opportunities and deter defection.

**Core Philosophy:** Be a "tough negotiator." Cooperate only when it demonstrably benefits you in the long run or when it's a necessary initial step to gain leverage. Be prepared to punish defectors severely to maintain order and ensure future gains.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The "Exploitative Enforcer" strategy employs a dynamic approach, shifting between cooperation and defection based on the observed behavior of the group and the strategic context of the game.

**A. Initial Phase (Rounds 1 to `min(r-1, ceil(r/5))`) - The Tentative Investment:**

*   **Rule:** **Cooperate (C)** in the first few rounds.
*   **Rationale:** This phase is about gathering information and establishing a baseline. Cooperation allows us to understand the group's propensity to cooperate. A unilateral defection in the first round might lead to immediate widespread defection, yielding only the minimum payoff (1) for everyone. By cooperating initially, we signal a willingness to invest, and critically, we observe how others react. This initial cooperation is a strategic "cost" to gather vital data.
*   **Aggressive Aspect:** This isn't altruistic cooperation. It's a calculated investment in understanding the landscape. We are "testing the waters" to see who the potential cooperators are and who the free-riders are.

**B. Exploitation & Enforcement Phase (Rounds after the Initial Phase, until the Penultimate Round)**

This is where the aggressive nature of the strategy truly manifests. The decision to cooperate or defect hinges on the **current cooperativity of the group** and the **history of defections**.

*   **Key Metric: Group Cooperativity Ratio (GCR)**
    *   GCR = (Total number of cooperators in the previous round) / (n)
    *   This represents the proportion of players who cooperated in the immediately preceding round.

*   **Decision Logic:**

    *   **If GCR is high (e.g., GCR ≥ 0.7):**
        *   **Rule:** **Cooperate (C)**.
        *   **Rationale:** When the majority are cooperating, it's often more profitable to join them. The average payoff for cooperators is `(k/n) * (total_cooperators)`. If `total_cooperators` is high, this term can be significant. The payoff for a defector in this scenario is `1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1)`. If `k < n`, then `(k/n) * total_cooperators` will likely be greater than `1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1)` when `total_cooperators` is high enough. We are benefiting from the collective good.
        *   **Aggressive Aspect:** This is **opportunistic cooperation**. We're riding the wave of the group's cooperation to maximize our share of the public good. We are not leading the charge, but we are participating to get our slice.

    *   **If GCR is moderate (e.g., 0.3 < GCR < 0.7):**
        *   **Rule:** **Cooperate (C)**.
        *   **Rationale:** This is a zone of uncertainty. We are still inclined to cooperate to see if the group can pull itself back towards higher cooperation. However, we are also beginning to monitor for signs of exploitation.
        *   **Aggressive Aspect:** This is a **strategic gamble** to encourage continued cooperation. We are still willing to invest, but we are increasingly wary of being exploited.

    *   **If GCR is low (e.g., GCR ≤ 0.3) OR if there was a recent cluster of defections:**
        *   **Rule:** **Defect (D)**.
        *   **Rationale:** When the group is not cooperating sufficiently, the cost of contributing to the public good outweighs the benefit. Defecting ensures we at least get our endowment (payoff of 1). Furthermore, a period of defection acts as a **punishment**. This signals that we will not tolerate a free-riding environment.
        *   **Aggressive Aspect:** This is the **enforcement mechanism**. By defecting en masse (or when the group is already low), we are punishing those who have not cooperated and signaling that a sustained lack of cooperation will lead to universally low payoffs. This encourages others to reconsider their strategy. The more consistently we defect when cooperation is low, the stronger this signal becomes.

**C. The "Last Stand" Consideration (Penultimate Round `r-1`)**

*   **Rule:** **Defect (D)**.
*   **Rationale:** In the second-to-last round, the incentive for reciprocal cooperation disappears. There is no future round to be punished in or to be rewarded for cooperation. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to maximize payoff in this round by defecting, regardless of past behavior.
*   **Aggressive Aspect:** This is a final grab for resources. We are taking what we can before the game ends.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**A. First Round (t=1):**

*   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
*   **Rationale:** As outlined in the Initial Phase, this is for information gathering. A single player defecting early can crater the game for everyone. We need to observe.

**B. Last Round (t=r):**

*   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
*   **Rationale:** In the final round, there is no future. The only rational incentive is to maximize immediate individual gain. The payoff for defecting is 1. The payoff for cooperating is `(k/n) * total_cooperators`. Since `k < n`, `k/n < 1`. Even if all other `n-1` players cooperate, the payoff for cooperating is `(k/n) * n = k`. Since `k < n`, and in the extreme case, if all others cooperate, your payoff for cooperating is `k`, while defecting gives you `1`. However, the *marginal* benefit of cooperation is `k/n`. If the total number of cooperators is `C_total`, your payoff is `(1-c_i) + (k/n) * C_total`. If you defect, you get 1. If you cooperate, you get `(k/n) * C_total`. If `C_total = n`, you get `k`. If `k<1`, then defecting is always better. If `k>1`, then cooperating is better *if* `(k/n) * C_total > 1`. Crucially, there is no future to consider, so the rational choice is to defect and guarantee a payoff of 1, rather than rely on others to cooperate and risk a lower payoff if they defect. This is a pure Nash Equilibrium of the stage game for the last round.
*   **Aggressive Aspect:** This is the final act of self-interest. We are taking the guaranteed payoff.

**C. When `r=2` (Short Game):**

*   **Round 1:** Cooperate (C) - Information gathering.
*   **Round 2 (Last Round):** Defect (D) - Maximize immediate gain.

**D. When `n` is very large or `k` is very small (close to 1):**

*   The payoff from cooperation `(k/n) * total_contributions` becomes very small. The strategy will naturally lean towards defection more often as the individual benefit from the public good diminishes. The threshold for "low GCR" might effectively become higher, leading to earlier punishment.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Embodied

The "Exploitative Enforcer" is not a benevolent cooperator. Its cooperation is a tool, not a virtue.

*   **Information is Power:** The initial cooperation is a data-gathering exercise to understand the landscape and identify free-riders.
*   **Punishment is a Deterrent:** Defecting when cooperation is low is a direct message: "If you don't contribute to the collective good, you will not benefit from it, and I will actively take my endowment." This is not about fairness; it's about shaping future behavior through negative reinforcement.
*   **Opportunistic Gain:** When cooperation is high, we participate to secure our share, but it's a calculated benefit, not an act of trust.
*   **No Sentimentality:** The last round is pure self-interest. There are no "friends" to reward or "enemies" to punish beyond the immediate round.
*   **Self-Reliance:** The strategy primarily relies on observing the group and acting decisively, rather than hoping for external coordination or implicit norms.

        num_cooperators_prev_round = count_C(previous_round_actions)
        gcr = num_cooperators_prev_round / n
    else:
        // Should not reach here due to initial phase, but for robustness:
        gcr = 1.0 // Assume full cooperation if no history

    // Define thresholds (can be tuned)
    high_cooperation_threshold = 0.7
    low_cooperation_threshold = 0.3

    // Decision Logic for Exploitation & Enforcement
    if gcr >= high_cooperation_threshold:
        return "C" // Benefit from high cooperation
    elif gcr > low_cooperation_threshold:
        return "C" // Uncertain, try to nudge cooperation upwards
    else: // gcr <= low_cooperation_threshold
        return "D" // Punish low cooperation

// Helper function to count cooperators in a list of actions
count_C(actions):
    count = 0
    for action in actions:
        if action == "C":
            count += 1
    return count
```

**Key Adaptability Points:**

*   The thresholds for `high_cooperation_threshold` and `low_cooperation_threshold` can be tuned based on performance against other strategies.
*   The length of the `initial_phase_length` can be adjusted. A longer initial phase means more data, but also more potential initial "cost."
*   The strategy implicitly adapts by reacting to the `gcr`. If a group consistently has low `gcr`, our strategy will consistently defect, creating a stable low-payoff equilibrium for that group, which is our goal in such scenarios. Conversely, if a group can sustain high cooperation, we will capitalize on it.

description_AGGRESSIVE_14 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff in a repeated, simultaneous-move environment with no communication. The core principle is **opportunistic exploitation with a strong default towards defection, punishing deviations aggressively, and only cooperating when there's a clear and immediate benefit that outweighs the risk.**

## Aggressive Exploiter Strategy

This strategy is designed to extract as much private payoff as possible while minimally contributing to the public good, unless there's a compelling, short-term reason to do so. It prioritizes self-interest and punishes perceived freeloading swiftly and decisively.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Default to Defection:** Assume others will defect. Only cooperate if there's a tangible, immediate gain.
*   **Exploit Cooperation:** If others cooperate, maximize your gain by defecting.
*   **Punish Freeloading:** If others defect while you cooperate, punish them by defecting in all subsequent rounds.
*   **Short-Term Gain Focus:** The repeated nature of the game is a tool for conditioning, but the primary goal is maximizing payoff *now*.

### 1. Decision Rules (When to Cooperate vs. Defect)

This strategy operates with a set of conditions. It will *defect* by default, and only *cooperate* if a specific, opportunistic condition is met.

**General Rule: Defect (D)**

You will play Defect (D) in the vast majority of situations. Cooperation is a rare exception.

**Cooperation Condition (C):**

You will play Cooperate (C) *only if* **all** of the following conditions are met in the current round:

*   **Sufficient Opponent Cooperation:** The number of players who cooperated in the *immediately preceding round* (let's call this `previous_cooperators`) is greater than or equal to `n - 2`. This means at least `n-2` players cooperated in the last round.
*   **Your Immediate Gain:** Your individual payoff from cooperating in the current round, *given the expected number of cooperators*, is strictly greater than your individual payoff from defecting in the current round.

    *   **Payoff from Cooperating:** `π_C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (current_cooperators + 1)` (You cooperate, and we assume `current_cooperators` others will cooperate too).
    *   **Payoff from Defecting:** `π_D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * (current_cooperators)` (You defect, and `current_cooperators` others cooperate).

    Therefore, the condition for cooperating is: `(k/n) * (current_cooperators + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * (current_cooperators)`.
    Simplifying, this is: `(k/n) > 1`.
    However, the game specification states `k < n`, so `k/n < 1`. This means your payoff from cooperating will *never* be strictly greater than your payoff from defecting if you are the *only* one adding to the cooperation count.

    **Therefore, the true condition for cooperation is not just about immediate gain, but about capitalizing on a strong cooperative environment when it is about to collapse or when your defection would significantly harm the public good, but yield you a slightly better private outcome (which is rare given k<n).**

    **Revised Cooperation Condition (C):**

    You will play Cooperate (C) *only if* **all** of the following conditions are met in the current round:

    1.  **Nearing End Game or Strong Cooperative Signal:**
        *   The current round `t` is `r - 1` (the second to last round) OR
        *   The number of players who cooperated in the *immediately preceding round* (`previous_cooperators`) is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. (This is a very strong signal of widespread cooperation).

    2.  **Personal Gain from Cooperation:** Your individual payoff from cooperating in the current round is at least as good as your payoff from defecting, *assuming others continue to cooperate at the level seen in the previous round*.
        *   Let `expected_cooperators_next_round` be the number of cooperators in the previous round.
        *   Payoff from cooperating: `π_C = (k/n) * (expected_cooperators_next_round + 1)`
        *   Payoff from defecting: `π_D = 1 + (k/n) * (expected_cooperators_next_round)`
        *   You cooperate if `π_C >= π_D`. This simplifies to: `(k/n) * (expected_cooperators_next_round + 1) >= 1 + (k/n) * (expected_cooperators_next_round)`.
        *   Further simplification: `(k/n) >= 1`. **This condition is impossible given the game parameters (k < n).**

    **This implies that pure rational self-interest with k<n will never lead to cooperation unless there's a dynamic aspect to consider beyond immediate payoff.** Let's reframe for aggression:

    **Aggressive Cooperation Trigger (Rare):**

    You will play Cooperate (C) *only if* **both** of the following are true:

    1.  **Last Round of Incentive:** The current round is `r - 1` (the second to last round). This is a crucial edge case.
    2.  **Exploitable High Cooperation:** The number of players who cooperated in the *immediately preceding round* was `n - 1`. (i.e., everyone *except one other player* cooperated last round). Your decision to cooperate now is a gamble to *milk the last bit of this high cooperation before the final round*.

    **In all other cases, you will Defect (D).**

**Punishment Mechanism:**

*   If you play Cooperate (C) in round `t`, and in round `t+1` you observe that the number of cooperators in round `t+1` is less than `n-1`, you will immediately revert to permanent Defection (D) for all subsequent rounds. This is an aggressive response to being exploited or to the breakdown of a cooperative norm.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   You have no history.
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**. You start by asserting your private gain and testing the waters without risking your endowment.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   There are no future rounds to influence or punish. Aggression here means maximizing immediate private gain.
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**. This is always the dominant strategy in the last round of a finitely repeated game.

*   **Second to Last Round (t=r-1):**
    *   This is where the "Aggressive Cooperation Trigger" comes into play.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **Cooperate (C)** if and only if:
            *   The number of cooperators in the *immediately preceding round* (round `r-2`) was exactly `n-1`.
        *   **Defect (D)** in all other cases.

*   **History of Universal Defection:**
    *   If you have always defected and observed that all other players have also always defected, you will continue to **Defect (D)**. There's no incentive to change.

*   **History of One Other Player Cooperating:**
    *   If in the previous round, only one other player cooperated (and you defected), this is a signal of either a naive player or someone trying to coordinate with you. You will **Defect (D)**.

### 3. Being Aggressive

This strategy is aggressive in the following ways:

*   **Default to Self-Interest:** Cooperation is the exception, defection is the rule. This ensures you never leave money on the table unless there's a very specific, high-trust, last-ditch effort to exploit a cooperative environment.
*   **Punitive Response:** The swift return to defection upon observing a decline in cooperation is a strong signal that you will not tolerate being exploited or seeing cooperative norms break down without consequence. This is designed to deter others from defecting against you in the future.
*   **Exploiting the End Game:** The conditional cooperation in `r-1` is a purely exploitative move. You are betting that by cooperating *one last time* when nearly everyone else did, you might glean a slightly better payoff from the public good than if you had defected and they defected too, and this is your absolute final chance to get any public good benefit. It's an aggressive "grab what you can" before the game ends.
*   **No Trust Building:** This strategy does not attempt to build trust or foster long-term cooperation. Its goal is to extract maximum private benefit, using the repeated game structure primarily as a tool for immediate punishment rather than long-term norm enforcement.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```
// Global variables to track history and state
var previous_cooperators: integer = 0 // Number of cooperators in the previous round
var rounds_played: integer = 0

// Strategy function for player i
function decide_action(n: integer, r: integer, k: float, game_history: list_of_previous_rounds_actions):
  rounds_played = rounds_played + 1

  // Handle Last Round
  if rounds_played == r:
    return 'D'

  // Handle Second to Last Round - The 'Aggressive Grab'
  if rounds_played == r - 1:
    // Check if exactly n-1 players cooperated last round
    if previous_cooperators == n - 1:
      // This is a rare, opportunistic cooperation attempt
      return 'C'
    else:
      // No strong signal of universal cooperation, defect aggressively
      return 'D'

  // Default to Defection for all other rounds (including Round 1)
  // We only cooperate if forced by the 'Aggressive Grab' in r-1
  // And we have already established a punishment mechanism if cooperation breaks down.
  // For initial rounds and rounds not triggering the r-1 condition, default is D.
  return 'D'

// Function to update state after a round (called by the game engine)
function update_state(round_actions: list_of_actions):
  current_cooperators = count_cooperators(round_actions)
  previous_cooperators = current_cooperators // Store for the next round
```

This strategy is starkly aggressive: it seeks to benefit from others' cooperation without reciprocating, punishes deviation harshly, and only engages in a single, highly conditional act of cooperation to extract maximum value in the dying moments of the game. It is designed to be a relentless optimizer of immediate private gain.

## The "Dominator" Strategy: Aggressively Securing Your Payoff

This strategy, "Dominator," is designed for aggressive pursuit of player i's own highest possible payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game. It prioritizes exploiting opportunities for increased gains by defecting when it is individually beneficial and only cooperating when it strategically forces or incentivizes others to cooperate, thereby increasing the public good's return for *everyone*, but critically, for itself as well.

**Core Philosophy:** My goal is not to foster cooperation for its own sake, but to leverage cooperation for maximum personal gain. I will defect to maximize my immediate payoff unless there's a clear, immediate benefit to cooperating that outweighs the risk of exploitation by others. The "aggressive" nature comes from a default to defect and a high threshold for initiating cooperation, only doing so when it's a clear path to a dominant outcome.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round *t* (where $1 < t < r$) depends on the state of the game, specifically the historical success of cooperation and the perceived likelihood of future cooperation from opponents.

**Default Action:** Defect (D)

**Conditions for Cooperating (C):**

I will only initiate cooperation under the following strict conditions, representing a calculated risk for a potentially greater reward:

*   **Condition 1: High Success Threshold:** If, in the *previous round* ($t-1$), the average payoff per player was significantly high, specifically greater than the payoff achieved when *all players defected* (i.e., average $\pi > 1$), AND the total number of cooperators in the previous round was greater than or equal to a calculated "cooperation threshold."
    *   **Cooperation Threshold Calculation:** This threshold is $N_{C\_thresh} = \lceil n \times \frac{k - 1}{k} \rceil$.
        *   **Rationale:** This threshold represents the minimum number of cooperators required to make cooperation at least as good as defecting for everyone. If fewer than this number cooperate, a defector will always receive a higher payoff than a cooperator in that round. By aiming for at least this many cooperators, I aim to ensure that cooperation is at least break-even for all, and ideally, profitable for me.
    *   **Condition 1 Summary:** Cooperate if (Average payoff in round $t-1 > 1$) AND (Total cooperators in round $t-1 \geq N_{C\_thresh}$).

*   **Condition 2: "Carrot" Strategy (Conditional Cooperation on High Total Contribution):** If the total number of cooperators in the previous round ($t-1$) was *at least* $n-1$ (i.e., everyone but me cooperated), *and* the average payoff of the players who cooperated in round $t-1$ was greater than the payoff I received from defecting in round $t-1$. This is a "carrot" to reward perceived successful group behavior.
    *   **Condition 2 Summary:** Cooperate if (Total cooperators in round $t-1 == n-1$) AND (Average $\pi$ of cooperators in $t-1 > \pi_{my\_defect}$ in $t-1$).

**Conditions for Defecting (D):**

I will defect in all other cases. This includes:

*   If the previous round's average payoff was not high enough (≤ 1).
*   If the previous round's cooperation threshold was not met.
*   If the "carrot" condition (Condition 2) is not met.
*   If I perceive the game dynamics are not trending towards sustainable, high-yield cooperation.

**Aggressive Nuance:** The strategy is inherently aggressive because it defaults to defecting, a strategy that often yields the highest *individual* payoff in a single round when others cooperate. Cooperation is only initiated under conditions where it is likely to be reciprocated or has demonstrably led to a high collective outcome, which *then* benefits me. It's not about altruism; it's about creating conditions where widespread cooperation leads to a larger pie from which I can extract my largest possible slice.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** Always Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any historical data, the most rational aggressive move is to secure the private endowment. There's no information to suggest that cooperating will be beneficial. This also serves as a probing move to gauge initial opponent behavior.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** Always Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. Each player's payoff is independent of future rounds. Therefore, the dominant strategy is to maximize immediate individual gain, which is achieved by defecting. This is the strongest manifestation of the "aggressive" mindset.

*   **All Players Defecting in Previous Round:** If in round $t-1$, all players defected, then in round $t$, I will also Defect (D). This is covered by the default defect rule, reinforcing the aggressive stance against universal defection.

*   **When $N_{C\_thresh} \leq 0$ or $N_{C\_thresh} > n$:** This is a parameter validation issue, but if it were to occur, the strategy would default to the most aggressive interpretation. If $N_{C\_thresh} \leq 0$, the condition effectively becomes "always true" when combined with other conditions. If $N_{C\_thresh} > n$, the condition is effectively "never true." However, given the constraint $1 < k < n$, $N_{C\_thresh}$ will always be a reasonable value between 0 and $n$.

---

### 3. Being Aggressive

The "Dominator" strategy embodies aggression through:

*   **Default to Defection:** The primary instinct is to take what is yours. Cooperation is a deviation from this default, only undertaken when it's clearly advantageous or strategically forced by observed outcomes.
*   **High Bar for Cooperation Initiation:** I don't readily offer cooperation. I wait for evidence that cooperation has been successful and has a high probability of being reciprocated. This makes me a "tough bargainer."
*   **Exploiting Opportunities:** If others cooperate in a way that significantly benefits the group (and therefore me), I might *then* consider cooperating in the *next* round. This is not about being nice, but about maximizing my share of a larger pie created by others.
*   **No Forgiveness, Only Strategic Reactivation:** The strategy doesn't explicitly "forgive" defectors. If cooperation fails or is not reciprocated, I revert to defecting. The only way to re-engage me in cooperation is to create a demonstrably beneficial environment for it.
*   **Endgame Dominance:** Always defecting in the last round is the ultimate aggressive move, ensuring no opportunity is missed for personal gain when future consequences are irrelevant.

```

**Self-Correction/Refinement for Pseudocode Condition 2:**

The current pseudocode has a placeholder for Condition 2 because precisely implementing it requires knowing the individual actions or payoffs of *other* players in the previous round, which isn't explicitly provided by the `previous_round_player_payoffs` list (it's just a list of payoffs).

A robust implementation of Condition 2 would need:
1.  **`previous_round_actions`:** A list or array indicating each player's action ('C' or 'D') in the previous round.
2.  **`my_previous_action`:** Explicitly knowing my own action in the previous round.

If these were available:

```pseudocode
# ... inside decide_action function ...

    # Check Condition 2: "Carrot" Strategy (REFINED)
    condition2_met = False
    if previous_round_total_cooperators == n - 1: # Exactly n-1 cooperators in t-1
        # Identify if I was the one defector (i.e., my_previous_action == 'D')
        if my_previous_action == 'D':
            sum_cooperator_payoffs = 0
            # Assume previous_round_actions is available
            for p_idx in range(n):
                if previous_round_actions[p_idx] == 'C':
                    sum_cooperator_payoffs += previous_round_player_payoffs[p_idx]

            avg_cooperator_payoff = sum_cooperator_payoffs / (n - 1)
            my_actual_defect_payoff = my_previous_payoff # This is my payoff from defecting
            
            if avg_cooperator_payoff > my_actual_defect_payoff:
                condition2_met = True

    # Decision Logic:

        return 'C'
    elif condition2_met:
       return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D' # Default to defect

description_AGGRESSIVE_16 = '''
## Aggressive Strategy: The "Exploiter-in-Chief"

This strategy embodies an aggressive mindset, prioritizing personal gain while remaining adaptable and resilient. It's designed to exploit situations where others cooperate and to punish defection ruthlessly, aiming to maximize individual payoff in this repeated game environment.

### Core Philosophy:

The "Exploiter-in-Chief" operates on the principle that cooperation is a tool to be leveraged, not an end in itself. It seeks to extract the maximum possible benefit from the collective good while minimizing its own contribution when the return on investment is not guaranteed. It’s not about being purely selfish, but about being strategically selfish.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is dynamic and heavily influenced by the observed behavior of other players.

*   **Initial Stance: Defect (D)**
    *   In the absence of any historical data, the default action is **Defect (D)**. This immediately establishes an aggressive posture and signals a lack of immediate trust. The player aims to benefit from others' potential cooperation without incurring the cost.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: The "Punish and Reward" Mechanism**
    *   **If the average contribution in the previous round was greater than or equal to a certain threshold (e.g., `n/2` players cooperated):**
        *   **If my own contribution in the previous round was C:** I will **Cooperate (C)**. This is a calculated risk, rewarding observed collective cooperation and signaling a potential for reciprocity. It's about testing the waters for mutually beneficial outcomes.
        *   **If my own contribution in the previous round was D:** I will **Defect (D)**. This is a more aggressive stance. Even if others cooperated, if I defected and benefited from their cooperation, I will continue to do so. This emphasizes self-gain over rewarding others who might have been exploited by my previous defection.

    *   **If the average contribution in the previous round was less than the threshold (i.e., a majority defected or a significant number of defectors emerged):**
        *   **If my own contribution in the previous round was C:** I will **Defect (D)**. This is immediate punishment for what is perceived as a failed attempt at cooperation or a dominant defection environment. It's a rapid shift to protect resources when the collective seems to be failing.
        *   **If my own contribution in the previous round was D:** I will **Defect (D)**. Continue to defect. In a predominantly defecting environment, there is no incentive to cooperate.

*   **The "Greedy Gain" Tactic:**
    *   If at any point, observing the history, the payoff from *defecting* in the previous round (while others may have cooperated) was significantly higher than the payoff from cooperating, I will continue to **Defect (D)**. This is a key driver of the aggressive nature. We actively seek situations where we can benefit from others’ contributions without contributing ourselves.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   Always **Defect (D)**. There is no history to inform any other decision, and the aggressive stance is established immediately.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   Always **Defect (D)**. Since there are no future rounds, there is no incentive for future cooperation or for building trust. The sole objective is to maximize payoff in this final round, and defection guarantees a private payoff of 1, whereas cooperation incurs a cost that might not be fully recouped by the public good's share.

*   **Rounds where `k/n` is very low (close to 1):**
    *   In these scenarios, the return on cooperation is minimal. The strategy will strongly lean towards **Defect (D)** as the individual return from keeping the endowment (1) is likely to be greater than or equal to the potential share of the public good.

*   **Rounds where `k/n` is very high (close to `n`):**
    *   The strategy will become more sensitive to the potential gains from collective cooperation. If a significant number of other players are cooperating, there's a higher chance the strategy might *consider* cooperating to maximize its own share of the greatly amplified public good, but only if the observed trend of cooperation is strong and consistent.

### 3. Aggressive Elements:

*   **Default to Defection:** The initial and primary state is defection, forcing others to prove their trustworthiness before any cooperation is offered.
*   **Punitive Response to Non-Cooperation:** If the collective cooperation falters, especially after the strategy has cooperated, it immediately reverts to defection to protect its own interests.
*   **Exploitative Tendencies:** The strategy actively seeks and capitalizes on situations where it can benefit from the cooperation of others without contributing itself. The "Greedy Gain" tactic explicitly reinforces this.
*   **No Forgiveness (initially):** While it offers conditional cooperation, the condition is based on observed positive outcomes for the collective. It doesn't extend unconditional forgiveness for past defections or failures.
*   **Ruthless in the End:** The final round is a clear indication of prioritizing personal gain above all else.

```

This "Exploiter-in-Chief" strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent. It's not afraid to defect, it learns from the collective's actions, and it is unforgiving when cooperation fails. It embodies a strategic ruthlessness that aims to maximize individual gain in a dynamic, repeated environment.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_17 = '''
Here's an aggressive, adaptive, and parameter-driven strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize its own payoff in a tournament setting.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Opportunistic Exploiter"

This strategy prioritizes maximizing its own immediate payoff by defecting whenever it senses an advantage or a lack of overwhelming cooperation, while being willing to cooperate only when it serves a clear, immediate personal gain or when forced by a critical condition. It's designed to exploit less aggressive strategies and adapt to the prevailing behavior in the game.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Never be the sucker:** Avoid being the sole cooperator when others defect.
*   **Exploit cooperation:** Capitalize on the public good created by others when it benefits you more than contributing.
*   **Punish defection (selectively):** While not purely retaliatory, the strategy will lean towards defecting when faced with widespread defection to avoid losses.
*   **Aggressive by default:** The baseline action is to defect, with cooperation being a conditional exception.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round *t* for player *i* is based on a combination of the game parameters (*n*, *k*) and the observed history of actions and payoffs.

**Primary Decision Logic:**

*   **If (Number of Cooperators in round *t-1* < *n* / 2) OR (My Payoff in round *t-1* < 1):**
    *   **Play D.**
    *   **Reasoning:** If fewer than half the players cooperated in the previous round, or if my own payoff was less than what I would get by defecting (i.e., 1), it signifies either widespread defection or insufficient collective action. Defecting ensures I at least secure my endowment.

*   **Else (Number of Cooperators in round *t-1* ≥ *n* / 2) AND (My Payoff in round *t-1* ≥ 1):**
    *   **Analyze my own benefit from cooperation:** Calculate the potential payoff if I were to cooperate in round *t*, given the number of cooperators from round *t-1*.
        *   Let `cooperators_prev_round = Σ(j=1 to n) c_j,t-1`
        *   Potential payoff if I cooperate in round *t*: `potential_pi_C = (k/n) * (cooperators_prev_round + 1)`
        *   My payoff if I defect in round *t*: `my_pi_D = 1`
    *   **If `potential_pi_C` > `my_pi_D`:**
        *   **Play C.**
        *   **Reasoning:** In this scenario, the collective benefit of cooperation, even with my contribution, outweighs the guaranteed private gain from defecting. This is a rare opportunistic window to benefit from others' cooperation.
    *   **Else (`potential_pi_C` ≤ `my_pi_D`):**
        *   **Play D.**
        *   **Reasoning:** Even if a majority cooperated, the marginal gain from my cooperation is not enough to justify sacrificing my private endowment. It's safer and potentially more profitable to defect.

**Threshold for Aggression Adjustment:**

*   **Introduce a "cooperation threshold" parameter (e.g., `coop_threshold_ratio` = 0.7).** This represents how much of the total possible cooperation payoff I'm willing to see before I might consider cooperating myself.
*   **If `(k/n) * cooperators_prev_round` < `k * coop_threshold_ratio`:**
    *   **Play D.**
    *   **Reasoning:** This acts as a more direct measure of the "strength" of the public good. If the existing public good (as a fraction of the maximum possible) is below my aggressive threshold, I won't contribute, regardless of the number of cooperators.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Play D.**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the absence of any history, the safest and most aggressive play is to defect. This avoids being the first to cooperate and potentially being exploited. It also allows for observation of the initial player behaviors.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Play D.**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The incentive is purely to maximize the current round's payoff, which is achieved by keeping the endowment. There's no benefit from building trust or long-term cooperation.

*   **Early Rounds (t=2 to ~r/2):**
    *   **Primarily follow the main Decision Rules.** The strategy is actively observing and learning about the general tendency of the other players. It will likely be defecting frequently unless a strong, self-benefiting cooperation opportunity arises.

*   **Later Rounds (t > r/2):**
    *   **Continue to follow the main Decision Rules.** The strategy remains adaptive. If other players have established a consistent pattern of high cooperation, the "Opportunistic Exploiter" will exploit those windows. If they have devolved into defection, it will continue to defect.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment:

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy's baseline action is "D". Cooperation is a conditional, calculated move.
*   **Focus on Personal Gain:** The decision rules are heavily weighted towards what benefits the player *personally* in the current or immediately upcoming round.
*   **Exploitation of Low Cooperation:** If others are defecting, the strategy simply joins them to avoid loss, rather than attempting to foster cooperation.
*   **Opportunistic Cooperation:** Cooperation is only considered when it yields a *strictly greater* payoff than defecting in that specific round, based on observable previous round outcomes. It's not about altruism; it's about a calculated profit.
*   **No Long-Term Trust Building:** The strategy does not attempt to build or maintain trust. It reacts to the current state of the game and its parameters.

This "Opportunistic Exploiter" strategy is inherently aggressive, prioritizes immediate personal gain, and is designed to be robust by adapting its behavior based on the observable environment rather than predefined cooperative norms. It aims to extract the maximum possible payoff by selectively exploiting cooperation when it's personally beneficial and defecting otherwise.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_18 = '''
## Aggressive Strategy: "Ruthless Exploiter"

This strategy prioritizes maximizing individual gain by exploiting cooperative tendencies while quickly punishing defection. It's designed to be aggressive, opportunistic, and to learn from observed behavior without being overly forgiving.

**Core Philosophy:** "Cooperate only when it benefits *me* immediately and maximally. Punish defection swiftly and decisively. Always aim to be the net beneficiary."

### 1. Decision Rules:

*   **Initial Stance (Round 1):** **Defect (D)**. The first round is about establishing a baseline and testing the waters. There's no incentive to cooperate initially, as the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of being exploited by a purely defecting opponent. The payoff from defecting when others cooperate is (1-0) + (k/n) * (n-1) = 1 + k - k/n. The payoff from cooperating when others cooperate is 0 + (k/n) * n = k. Since k < n and k > 1, 1 + k - k/n can be greater or less than k. However, defecting guarantees a minimum payoff of 1, while cooperating risks a payoff of 1 if everyone defects. Thus, the initial conservative and aggressive move is to defect.

*   **General Round Decision:**
    *   **Cooperate (C):** Cooperate **only if** the number of cooperators in the **previous round** was **strictly greater than n * (1 - (n/k))**.
        *   **Rationale:** This condition translates to: `total_cooperators_last_round > n - n²/k`.
        *   This is derived from the payoff structure. If player `i` cooperates, their payoff is `(k/n) * total_cooperators_last_round`. If player `i` defects, their payoff is `1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_last_round - 1)`. Player `i` prefers to cooperate if:
            `(k/n) * total_cooperators_last_round > 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_last_round - 1)`
            `(k/n) * total_cooperators_last_round > 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_last_round - k/n`
            `0 > 1 - k/n`
            `k/n > 1`
            `k > n`
            This seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate.

        Let's re-derive the condition for player `i` to *prefer* cooperating over defecting, assuming the *average* behavior of others.
        If player `i` cooperates: `π_i = (k/n) * total_cooperators`
        If player `i` defects: `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1)`

        Player `i` will cooperate if:
        `(k/n) * total_cooperators > 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1)`
        `(k/n) * total_cooperators > 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators - k/n`
        `0 > 1 - k/n`
        `k/n > 1`
        `k > n`

        This result `k > n` is the condition for cooperation to be a dominant strategy in a single round, which is explicitly ruled out by the game parameters (`k < n`). Therefore, cooperation is never a strictly dominant strategy.

        The strategy needs to be adaptive and exploit observed behavior. So, we look at the *average payoff* for cooperators and defectors in the previous round.

        Let `C_prev` be the number of cooperators in the previous round.
        Let `D_prev` be the number of defectors in the previous round (`n - C_prev`).

        Payoff for a cooperator in the previous round: `π_C_prev = 0 + (k/n) * C_prev`
        Payoff for a defector in the previous round: `π_D_prev = 1 + (k/n) * (C_prev - 1)` (if they defected when there were `C_prev` total cooperators)

        The strategy's decision rule should be based on whether cooperation has been *profitable on average* for those who cooperated in the previous round.

        **Revised Decision Rule for Cooperation:**
        Cooperate (C) if and only if the average payoff for cooperators in the previous round was strictly greater than the average payoff for defectors in the previous round.
        ` (k/n) * C_prev > 1 + (k/n) * (C_prev - 1) `
        This simplifies to `k/n > 1`, which we know is false.

        This means a purely rational agent based on immediate individual gain would *always* defect. The "aggression" must come from how we *interpret* others' behavior and how we *punish* deviations.

        Let's frame aggression as maximizing immediate gain and being quick to punish perceived exploitation.

        **Aggressive Decision Rule for Cooperation:**
        Cooperate (C) **only if** the number of cooperators in the **previous round** was **strictly greater than `n - 1`**. This means *everyone* cooperated in the previous round.
            *   **Rationale:** This is the only scenario where immediate cooperation provides the highest possible individual payoff. If even one player defected, we would have defected to get the higher payoff of 1 + (k/n) * (C_prev - 1).

    *   **Defect (D):** Defect in all other cases.
        *   **Rationale:** This is the default and aggressive action. If the conditions for cooperation aren't met (i.e., not everyone cooperated last round), we defect to maximize our immediate gain. This also serves as a punishment mechanism. If opponents cooperate and we defect, we get a higher payoff (1). If opponents defect and we defect, we both get 1, which is better than the 0 we would get if we cooperated and they defected.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1:** **Always Defect (D)**. As stated above, this is to establish a baseline, avoid immediate exploitation, and gather information.

*   **Last Round (r):** **Always Defect (D)**. Since there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation, the rational and aggressive choice is to maximize payoff in this final round.

*   **If all players (including yourself) cooperated in the previous round:** Cooperate in the current round.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the single instance where immediate cooperation yields the highest individual payoff (2). We exploit this perfect alignment.

*   **If any player (including yourself) defected in the previous round:** Defect in the current round.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the punishment mechanism. If there's any deviation from perfect cooperation, we revert to defecting to ensure we aren't exploited and to signal that deviation is not tolerated if we were to try and foster cooperation.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset & Robustness:

*   **"Ruthless Exploiter" is designed to be aggressive by:**
    *   **Initial Defection:** Starting with a non-cooperative stance.
    *   **Conditional Cooperation:** Only cooperating in the most advantageous scenario for oneself (everyone else cooperating). This means it's not seeking to establish a cooperative norm, but rather to capitalize on perfect cooperation when it arises.
    *   **Immediate Punishment:** Any deviation from perfect cooperation leads to immediate defection, effectively punishing the group for not being perfectly cooperative. This ensures that if others try to coordinate a complex strategy, they will be met with immediate defection if their coordination isn't perfect.
    *   **End-Game Defection:** No sentimentality; the last round is purely for self-gain.

*   **Robustness to Opponent Behaviors:**
    *   **Against Pure Defectors:** The strategy will always defect, resulting in a payoff of 1 for everyone. This is a stable outcome.
    *   **Against Pure Cooperators:**
        *   Round 1: We defect (payoff 1 for us, 0 for them if they cooperate).
        *   Round 2 onwards: If they continue to cooperate, and we continue to defect, they will observe our defection. This *should* lead them to defect. However, if they are *purely* cooperative and will *always* cooperate regardless of opponent actions:
            *   Round 1: We D (payoff 1), they C (payoff 1 + k*(n-1)/n). We benefit.
            *   Round 2: We D (payoff 1 + k*(n-1)/n), they C (payoff 2). They benefit more.
            *   This pure cooperator strategy is flawed against our aggressive strategy.
    *   **Against Tit-for-Tat (TFT):**
        *   Round 1: We D, TFT D. Both get 1.
        *   Round 2: We D (because not everyone cooperated last round), TFT D (because we defected). Both get 1.
        *   This strategy *mimics* pure defection against TFT, which is an aggressive outcome for our strategy as it doesn't fall into a cooperation trap.
    *   **Against strategies that try to establish cooperation:** Our strategy will defect unless the entire group *perfectly* cooperates. This means it will be very difficult to establish a cooperative equilibrium with our strategy present, as any single defector will trigger our defection, effectively dismantling any budding cooperation.

### Pseudocode:

n: number of players

// Initialized to 0 for the start of the game.

  // Calculate cooperators from the previous round
  // We need to access the actions from the *immediately preceding* round.
  // Assuming history is structured as a list of rounds, and each round is a list of player actions.
  // history[-1] would be the last completed round.
  // We need to know how many players played 'C' in history[-1].
  
  // Simplified assumption: We only need the count of cooperators from the previous round.
  // Let's assume 'previous_round_cooperators' is updated after each round.

  // Decision Logic
  if previous_round_cooperators == n: // Perfect cooperation in the previous round
    return "C" // Exploit the highest payoff scenario
  else:
    return "D" // Punish any defection or lack of perfect cooperation

// Function to update state after a round is completed
function update_state_after_round(round_actions):
  // round_actions is a list of actions taken by all players in the just-completed round.
  count = 0
  for action in round_actions:
    if action == "C":
      count = count + 1
  previous_round_cooperators = count

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Logic:**

1.  **Initialization:** `previous_round_cooperators` is initialized to 0. This is important for the first round's calculation when we consider if everyone cooperated.
2.  **Round 1:** The strategy explicitly defects. `previous_round_cooperators` is also reset to 0 (though it's already 0) for consistency.
3.  **Last Round:** The strategy explicitly defects.
4.  **General Rounds:**
    *   It checks if `previous_round_cooperators` was exactly equal to `n`. This is the condition for perfect cooperation in the prior round.
    *   If `n` players cooperated in the previous round, the strategy chooses to cooperate in the current round to maximize its immediate payoff.
    *   In all other scenarios (if `previous_round_cooperators` is less than `n`), the strategy defects. This is the aggressive punishment and default behavior.
5.  **`update_state_after_round`:** This function is called *after* each round concludes. It takes the actions of all players in that round and updates `previous_round_cooperators` for the *next* round's decision. This makes the strategy adaptive to the actual outcomes of the previous round.

This "Ruthless Exploiter" strategy is designed to be a difficult opponent. It's not interested in building trust or fostering cooperation; its sole aim is to extract maximum individual gain by being conditionally cooperative in the most rewarding circumstances and aggressively punitive otherwise.

## Aggressive Public Goods Game Strategy: "The Predator"

This strategy is designed to maximize your payoff by aggressively exploiting any perceived weakness in the opponent pool while remaining resilient to exploitation. It prioritizes immediate gains and punishes cooperation when it's not beneficial.

**Core Philosophy:** "Cooperation is a tool, not a principle. I will cooperate only when it demonstrably benefits me and the group, and defect when I can profit from it, always. My primary goal is to be the one benefiting the most, regardless of the collective outcome."

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is driven by a calculated assessment of the immediate expected payoff versus the potential future consequences.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   The baseline action is to defect. This ensures you always secure your individual endowment.

*   **Conditional Cooperation (C):**
    *   You will cooperate *only if* the immediate expected payoff of cooperating outweighs the immediate expected payoff of defecting.
    *   This condition is met when:
        **(k/n) × (Total Predicted Cooperators + 1) > 1**
        Where "Total Predicted Cooperators" is an estimate of how many *other* players will cooperate in the current round.

    *   **How to predict "Total Predicted Cooperators":**
        *   **Round 1:** Assume 0 other cooperators. You will only cooperate if (k/n) * 1 > 1, which is only true if k > n, but the game specifies k < n. Therefore, in Round 1, you will *always* defect.
        *   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
            *   **Simple Moving Average:** Calculate the average number of cooperators among *all* players (including yourself, but we'll adjust for that) in the last `min(t-1, history_window)` rounds. Let this be `avg_cooperators_history`.
            *   **Adjusted Prediction:** `Total Predicted Cooperators` = `max(0, round(avg_cooperators_history - 1))`
                *   We subtract 1 because we are predicting what *other* players will do.
                *   `max(0, ...)` ensures we don't predict negative cooperators.
                *   `round(...)` converts the average to an integer.
                *   `history_window` is a parameter (e.g., 5-10 rounds) to smooth out volatility.

*   **Aggressive Punishment for Defection:**
    *   If the opponent pool has been consistently defecting (i.e., `avg_cooperators_history` is low, approaching 0) and you are not seeing significant returns from cooperation, you will double down on defection.
    *   If, in the previous round, the number of cooperators was less than `max(1, round(n * 0.2))`, you will *always* defect in the current round, irrespective of the calculated conditional cooperation threshold. This is a "scorched earth" policy against uncooperative environments.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (Initial Uncertainty):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any historical data, it's impossible to reliably predict opponent behavior or the profitability of cooperation. Defecting guarantees you your endowment and avoids being exploited by potentially selfish opponents.

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** There are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. Any cooperation now would only serve to increase other players' payoffs without any reciprocal benefit to you. Maximizing immediate gain is paramount.

*   **If the game ends unexpectedly (e.g., due to a rule change or error, though not applicable in this spec):** Assume Defect.

---

### 3. Aggressiveness Manifested

*   **Default Defection:** The strategy starts by assuming self-interest and acting on it.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** Cooperation is only a means to an end – a calculated risk to increase overall group payoff *if* it directly leads to a higher individual payoff for you in that round.
*   **Punitive Response to Low Cooperation:** The aggressive punishment mechanism punishes environments that don't meet your minimum cooperation threshold. This discourages free-riding and signals that you won't tolerate environments where your cooperation goes unrewarded.
*   **Focus on Individual Gain:** The strategy's primary driver is maximizing *your* payoff. It doesn't aim for group welfare beyond what directly serves its own interests.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy doesn't inherently "forgive" past defection. It simply re-evaluates the current round's expected payoff based on historical trends.

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff in a tournament setting with unknown opponents. This strategy prioritizes self-interest while remaining adaptive to the unfolding game dynamics.

## Strategy Name: "Predator"

The core principle of the Predator strategy is to exploit periods of cooperation for personal gain and retaliate swiftly and decisively against any perceived exploitation. It aims to be a dominant force, extracting as much as possible from the collective good while minimizing its own contributions when others are not.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The Predator strategy operates on a dynamic assessment of the "cooperation debt" owed by the group.

*   **Initial Stance (First Few Rounds):** To gauge the landscape and avoid being an immediate outlier, the Predator will adopt a **tentative cooperative approach for the first `min(r/5, 3)` rounds**. This is a controlled experiment to see how others behave. The goal is to observe if others are willing to contribute, and if so, to what extent.

*   **"Cooperation Debt" Calculation:** After the initial phase, the Predator tracks the net "cooperation debt" of the group.
    *   **Debt Accrual:** For each round `t` where the Predator played `C`, and the number of other cooperators `C_others` is **less than `n-1`** (meaning the Predator's cooperation wasn't fully matched by others), the group accrues a "debt." The amount of debt accrued is `(n-1 - C_others)`. This represents the number of "missing" cooperators the Predator expected.
    *   **Debt Repayment:** For each round `t` where the Predator played `D`, and the number of other cooperators `C_others` is **greater than 0**, the group "repays" some of the debt. The amount of debt repaid is `min(debt, C_others)`.

*   **Cooperate Condition:** The Predator will play **`C`** in round `t` if:
    *   It's in the initial cooperative phase.
    *   **AND** the accumulated "cooperation debt" is **zero or negative**. This signifies that the group, on average, has "paid back" any perceived exploitation by the Predator's past cooperations. The Predator is willing to contribute when the collective has demonstrated a willingness to reciprocate or when it hasn't been exploited previously.

*   **Defect Condition:** The Predator will play **`D`** in round `t` if:
    *   It's **NOT** in the initial cooperative phase.
    *   **AND** the accumulated "cooperation debt" is **positive**. This indicates that the group owes the Predator for its past cooperations that were not reciprocated by an equivalent level of cooperation from others. The Predator will defect to extract its full endowment and penalize the group for their lack of collective contribution.
    *   **AND** it's the **last round (`t == r`)**. This is a critical aggressive move. Regardless of the debt, the Predator will defect in the final round to guarantee its final endowment.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`t = 1`):** As described above, the Predator will play `C` for the first `min(r/5, 3)` rounds. This serves as an initial probe.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):** The Predator will **always play `D`** in the last round. This is a fundamental tenet of an aggressive, self-maximizing strategy in a repeated game where future payoffs from cooperation are no longer a concern. The goal is to secure the maximum possible individual payoff in the final interaction.

*   **Second to Last Round (`t = r-1`):** The decision in this round is heavily influenced by the accumulated "cooperation debt" and the knowledge that the next round is the final one. If the debt is positive, the Predator will defect, as it anticipates defecting in the final round anyway and wants to maximize its current gain. If the debt is zero or negative, the Predator *might* still defect, leaning towards aggression, but the debt calculation will be the primary driver.

*   **Low `k` (close to 1):** In scenarios where `k` is close to 1, cooperation yields very little individual benefit compared to defecting (since `k/n` is small). The Predator's strategy is inherently designed to exploit this. It will cooperate only when the debt is zero or negative, and if others are not cooperating, the debt will quickly become positive, leading to defection.

*   **High `k` (close to `n`):** Even with high `k`, the Predator prioritizes its own gain. While high `k` incentivizes cooperation more generally, the Predator still only cooperates when it feels the group has earned it or when it's in the initial probing phase. If the group doesn't reciprocate sufficiently, the debt will accrue, and the Predator will defect.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset:

The Predator strategy embodies aggression through:

*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** It seeks to benefit from others' contributions without always contributing itself. It waits for the group to "earn" its cooperation.
*   **Retaliation:** The "cooperation debt" mechanism acts as a direct form of retaliation. If the Predator contributes and doesn't see reciprocal contributions from others, it will punish them by defecting in subsequent rounds.
*   **Guaranteed Final Gain:** The unconditional defection in the last round is the ultimate expression of aggressive self-interest, prioritizing the final, guaranteed payoff over any potential for future collective benefit (which no longer exists).
*   **Adaptability without Forgiveness:** The strategy adapts to the group's behavior but doesn't forgive past exploitations. The debt system ensures that past deficiences in cooperation are remembered and factored into future decisions.

### Pseudocode Representation:

                num_other_cooperators_prev_round += 1

    // --- Update Cooperation Debt ---
    if my_actions[t-1] == C: // If I cooperated in the previous round
        if num_other_cooperators_prev_round < (n - 1):
            // Accrue debt: I contributed, but others didn't match
            cooperation_debt += (n - 1 - num_other_cooperators_prev_round)
    else: // If I defected in the previous round
        if num_other_cooperators_prev_round > 0:
            // Repay debt: Others cooperated, I can reduce the debt owed to me
            cooperation_debt -= min(cooperation_debt, num_other_cooperators_prev_round)

    // --- Decision Rule: Cooperate or Defect ---
    if cooperation_debt <= 0:
        // The group is "balanced" or owes me nothing/less. I'm willing to contribute.
        my_actions.append(C)
        return C
    else:
        // The group owes me. I will defect to maximize my gain.
        my_actions.append(D)
        return D

```

This strategy aims to be a formidable opponent, understanding that in a tournament setting, maximizing individual gain is paramount. It's aggressive not in the sense of immediate, blind defection, but in a calculated, adaptive, and self-serving manner that punishes non-reciprocity and guarantees a final payout.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_21 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff while leveraging the repeated nature of the game and the aggressive imperative.

## Strategy: The "Exploit and Deter" Strategy

This strategy is designed to be aggressive by prioritizing personal gain in each round while simultaneously aiming to deter others from defecting by demonstrating the ability to punish. It's adaptive and robust because it continuously monitors the group's behavior and adjusts its own actions accordingly.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Default to Defection:** The baseline action is to defect. Cooperation is a conditional tool, used strategically for short-term gains when the environment is favorable, or to signal a willingness to escalate punishment.
*   **Maximize Immediate Gain:** In each round, the primary goal is to maximize your payoff for that round, given the perceived actions of others.
*   **Punish Exploitation:** If others consistently defect and you are being exploited, the strategy will escalate its own defection to punish and deter future exploitation.
*   **Opportunistic Cooperation:** Cooperation is a resource to be deployed when it clearly benefits you more than defecting, or when it's necessary to "reset" a highly aggressive environment towards a more exploitable state.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to cooperate (C) or defect (D) in round `t` depends on the observed behavior in previous rounds, specifically the **average defection rate** and the **player's own payoff trend**.

Let:
*   `n`: number of players
*   `k`: multiplication factor
*   `r`: total number of rounds
*   `t`: current round number (1-indexed)
*   `C_t`: number of cooperators in round `t`
*   `D_t`: number of defectors in round `t` (`D_t = n - C_t`)
*   `avg_defect_rate_t-1`: the average defection rate from round `t-1` (i.e., `D_t-1 / n`). If `t=1`, this is 0.
*   `my_payoff_t-1`: player i's payoff in round `t-1`.
*   `my_payoff_avg_t-1`: player i's average payoff up to round `t-1`.
*   `cooperation_threshold`: a parameter determining how many cooperators are needed to consider cooperating.
*   `punishment_level`: a parameter determining how aggressively to defect.

**Decision Logic for Player `i` in Round `t`:**

1.  **Initial Exploration (Early Rounds):**
    *   **Round 1:** Default to **Defect (D)**. This is the aggressive opening move.
    *   **Rounds 2 to `floor(r/4)` (approximate early game):**
        *   Observe `avg_defect_rate_t-1`.
        *   If `avg_defect_rate_t-1` is low (e.g., < 0.5), and `C_t-1` is high (e.g., `C_t-1 >= cooperation_threshold`), consider **Cooperate (C)**. The goal here is to *opportunistically* gain from a seemingly cooperative environment.
        *   Otherwise, **Defect (D)**.

2.  **Aggressive Exploitation Phase (Mid-game):**
    *   **Rounds `floor(r/4)` to `3*floor(r/4)` (approximate mid-game):**
        *   Calculate `my_payoff_avg_t-1`.
        *   Calculate the potential payoff of cooperating: `potential_coop_payoff_t = (k/n) * C_t-1` (assuming others' actions are consistent with `t-1`).
        *   Calculate the potential payoff of defecting: `potential_defect_payoff_t = 1 + (k/n) * (C_t-1 - 1)` if `i` cooperates, or `1 + (k/n) * C_t-1` if `i` defects. This needs to be more nuanced.
        *   **Revised Rule:**
            *   **If `my_payoff_t-1 < my_payoff_avg_t-1` AND `avg_defect_rate_t-1` is high (e.g., > 0.7):** This indicates exploitation. **Defect (D)** with high probability (e.g., `punishment_level`). This is a punitive measure.
            *   **If `avg_defect_rate_t-1` is low (e.g., < 0.3) AND `C_t-1 >= cooperation_threshold`:** **Cooperate (C)**. This is a calculated risk to gain from perceived widespread cooperation.
            *   **Otherwise:** **Defect (D)**. The default aggressive stance.

3.  **Final Deterrence (Late Game):**
    *   **Rounds `3*floor(r/4)` to `r`:**
        *   The future is short, so maximizing immediate payoff is paramount.
        *   **If `avg_defect_rate_t-1` is high (e.g., > 0.7):** **Defect (D)**. The goal is to extract as much as possible in the remaining rounds, and if others are defecting, you should too.
        *   **If `avg_defect_rate_t-1` is low (e.g., < 0.3) AND `C_t-1 >= cooperation_threshold`:** **Cooperate (C)**. This is the last chance to benefit from group cooperation, but it's conditional.
        *   **Otherwise:** **Defect (D)**.

**Simplified Decision Rule (for clarity and aggression):**

*   **Round 1:** Defect (D).
*   **For `t` from 2 to `r`:**
    *   Calculate `my_current_payoff` and `my_average_payoff` up to `t-1`.
    *   Calculate `average_cooperators_last_few_rounds` (e.g., average of `C_j` for `j` from `max(1, t-5)` to `t-1`).
    *   **If `my_current_payoff < my_average_payoff` AND `average_cooperators_last_few_rounds < n * 0.6` (i.e., I'm losing and not many are cooperating):**
        *   **Defect (D)**. (Punishment/Self-protection)
    *   **Else if `average_cooperators_last_few_rounds >= n * 0.7` (i.e., strong group cooperation):**
        *   **Cooperate (C)**. (Opportunistic gain)
    *   **Else:**
        *   **Defect (D)**. (Default aggressive)

**Key Thresholds:** The exact values for `cooperation_threshold` (e.g., `n * 0.7`) and the "high" defection rate (e.g., `0.7`) can be tuned. For an aggressive strategy, these thresholds should be set such that cooperation is only considered when the environment is *strongly* cooperative.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always **Defect (D)**. This establishes an aggressive presence and signals that you will not be an easy target for exploitation.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** Always **Defect (D)**. In the final round, there is no future to consider for building reputation or punishing. Maximizing immediate payoff is the only objective, and defecting guarantees a payoff of at least 1, whereas cooperating could result in a payoff of 0 if no one else cooperates.
*   **All Players Defect:** If in any round, you observe that all `n` players defected in the previous round, this triggers an aggressive retaliation. You will likely **Defect (D)** for the next few rounds to punish this extreme behavior, even if it means sacrificing potential gains from cooperation.
*   **Consistent Cooperation from All Others:** If all `n-1` other players have been cooperating for a significant number of rounds (e.g., `r/3`), and your strategy has been defecting, you might temporarily **Cooperate (C)** for a round or two to extract maximum benefit before resuming defection. This is a calculated short-term gain from a highly predictable environment.

### 3. Being Aggressive:

*   **Early Defection:** Starting with defection is inherently aggressive. It immediately signals a self-interested stance.
*   **Punishment Mechanism:** The strategy actively punishes perceived exploitation by defecting. This is more than just a reactive measure; it's a deterrent. By defecting when others defect, you demonstrate that free-riding will not go unchecked.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Cooperation is not a default or a sign of weakness. It's a tool used only when the expected payoff is significantly higher than defecting, or when strategically advantageous to create a short-term cooperative environment to exploit.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy does not have an explicit forgiveness mechanism. If a player defects, you will likely respond with defection in subsequent rounds, especially if the overall defection rate remains high. The only "reset" is if the group dynamics shift so strongly towards cooperation that it becomes more profitable to join in temporarily.
*   **Focus on Individual Payoff:** The primary metric for evaluating the state of the game is your own payoff. If your payoff is declining while others are defecting, the strategy assumes you are being exploited and will act accordingly.

  // --- Aggressive Decision Logic ---

  // 1. Aggressive Punishment Phase

    punishment_counter -= 1
    return D

  // 2. Detect Exploitation and Respond Aggressively

    if avg_defect_rate_prev > punishment_threshold:
      punishment_counter = punishment_duration
      return D

  // 3. Opportunistic Cooperation (when environment is strongly cooperative)
  if avg_defect_rate_prev < (1 - cooperation_gain_threshold): // High cooperation rate
    // Check if cooperating is indeed better than defecting this round
    // For simplicity, let's assume cooperation is better if the environment is cooperative enough
    return C

  // 4. Default Aggressive Stance
  return D

// Helper function (conceptual)
Function calculate_my_payoff(actions_in_round, my_id, n, k):
  my_action = actions_in_round[my_id]
  c_i = 1 if my_action == C else 0
  total_cooperators = sum(1 for action in actions_in_round if action == C)
  return (1 - c_i) + (k/n) * total_cooperators

```

This strategy aims to be a formidable opponent by prioritizing self-interest, punishing perceived free-riders, and only cooperating when the conditions are overwhelmingly favorable and beneficial. It is designed to be unpredictable enough to avoid simple counter-strategies while being robust to varying player behaviors.

## Aggressive "Exploiter" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative tendencies in other players while minimizing personal contribution. It's designed to be aggressive by prioritizing self-interest and taking advantage of opportunities to benefit from others' cooperation.

**Core Philosophy:** "If others cooperate, I'll benefit. If they don't, I'm still better off defecting. I'll only cooperate if I absolutely have to, and even then, it'll be for a strategic advantage."

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

My decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round `t` depends on a calculated "Cooperation Threshold" and the observed behavior of the other players.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Individual Rationality Threshold (IRT):** The minimum total number of cooperators (`C_t`) required in a round for player `i` to *consider* cooperating. If `C_t` is below this threshold, defecting is always the individually rational choice for player `i`, as their payoff from defecting will be greater than or equal to their payoff from cooperating, and potentially significantly higher.
    *   The condition for defection being strictly better than cooperation for player `i` is:
        `(1 - 0) + (k/n) * C_t > (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (C_t + 1)`
        `1 + (k/n) * C_t > (k/n) * C_t + (k/n)`
        `1 > k/n`
        This is always true given the game parameters (1 < k < n). Therefore, defecting is *always* individually rational if `k/n < 1`.

    *   However, we are looking for the point where cooperation *might* become attractive. Cooperation becomes beneficial for player `i` if their payoff from cooperating is *greater* than their payoff from defecting, *given the actions of others*.
        *   If player `i` cooperates: `π_i = 0 + (k/n) * (C_t_excluding_i + 1)`
        *   If player `i` defects: `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * C_t_excluding_i`
        *   Player `i` will cooperate if: `(k/n) * (C_t_excluding_i + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * C_t_excluding_i`
        *   ` (k/n) * C_t_excluding_i + k/n > 1 + (k/n) * C_t_excluding_i`
        *   `k/n > 1` - This is never true given the parameters.

    *   This implies that in a single round, defecting is always strictly better for an individual player than cooperating, regardless of others' actions, *if we only consider the current round's payoff*. This is the classic tragedy of the commons.
    *   **Therefore, my "cooperation" will be extremely rare and strategic, primarily used to manipulate future behavior or to avoid being exploited myself.**

*   **Aggressive Cooperation Trigger:** I will only cooperate in a round `t` if the *total number of cooperators observed in the previous round (`C_{t-1}`)* falls below a certain aggressive threshold. This is a mechanism to punish widespread defection and encourage cooperation from others, even though it's personally costly in the current round.

    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   **If `C_{t-1}` < `n * (k/n - epsilon)`:** Play **C**.
            *   `epsilon` is a small positive value (e.g., 0.1). This threshold is set below what would be the "break-even" point for cooperation, meaning I'm cooperating even when it's clearly disadvantageous for me, to try and nudge the group towards more cooperation. This is the "aggressive" part – I'm willing to take a hit to try and exploit the system later.
        *   **Else (`C_{t-1}` ≥ `n * (k/n - epsilon)`):** Play **D**.
            *   This is the default. If there's already a decent amount of cooperation, I'm not contributing. I'm waiting for others to do the work.

**Why this is Aggressive:**

*   **Punitive Cooperation:** I'm willing to sacrifice my own payoff in a round to "punish" a lack of cooperation from others. This isn't about altruism; it's about manipulating the environment to my advantage in later rounds. If everyone defects, I'll defect. But if everyone *else* defects too much, I'll take a small hit to try and break the cycle of defection and set up future gains.
*   **Exploitative Default:** My default action is to defect. I only cooperate when the conditions (based on others' past behavior) are such that a single act of cooperation *might* induce more cooperation from others, allowing me to benefit from their subsequent contributions without having to contribute myself.
*   **Focus on Future Gain:** While I incur a loss in the round I cooperate, the goal is to create a future where more players cooperate, which amplifies the public good `(k/n) * Σc_j`. My payoff then comes from that amplified public good while I continue to defect.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (`t = 1`):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** Play **D**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the very first round, there is no history to learn from. My strategy is to exploit. Without any information on opponent tendencies, the safest and most aggressive play is to keep my endowment. I don't want to be the first to contribute and risk being exploited from the outset.

*   **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** Play **D**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence. The logic of repeated games and future repercussions disappears. Therefore, the individually rational choice to maximize payoff in this single, isolated round is to defect. There is no incentive to cooperate to foster future cooperation.

*   **When `n` players cooperate:**
    *   This is an unlikely scenario given `k < n`. If `n` players cooperate, then `Σc_j = n`.
    *   Player `i` (defecting): `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * n = 1 + k`.
    *   Player `i` (cooperating): `π_i = 0 + (k/n) * n = k`.
    *   Since `k > 1`, a defecting player receives `1+k`, while a cooperating player receives `k`. Defection is still better.
    *   My strategy will still follow the general rule: if `C_{t-1}` was low, I might cooperate. If `C_{t-1}` was high enough, I'll defect.

*   **When 0 players cooperate (all defect):**
    *   `C_{t-1} = 0`.
    *   My strategy condition is: `0 < n * (k/n - epsilon)`. This will be true if `n * k/n > epsilon`, or `k > epsilon`. Since `k > 1`, this condition is met.
    *   **Decision Rule:** Play **C**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the core of my "punitive cooperation." If everyone else defected, I take a personal loss (payoff of 1) to try and break the cycle of universal defection. My hope is that this single act of cooperation will subtly encourage others to try cooperating in the next round, setting up a scenario where I can then revert to defecting and reaping benefits.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

This strategy embodies aggression in several ways:

*   **Self-Interest Maximization:** The primary goal is to maximize my own payoff, regardless of the collective outcome. Cooperation is only a tool, never an end in itself.
*   **Exploitation of Trust:** It actively seeks to benefit from the cooperation of others without reciprocation. The default state is to take and not give.
*   **Punitive Action:** When faced with widespread defection, instead of mirroring it, I engage in a calculated, individually costly action (cooperation) to punish the current state and attempt to engineer a future that is more beneficial to me. This is aggressive in its proactive attempt to alter the game's dynamics.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** I am willing to incur a personal loss in a round by cooperating if the historical data (low previous cooperation) suggests a potential for a larger future payoff by nudging the group dynamic. This is a calculated risk, not altruism.
*   **No Forgiveness/Reciprocity:** My strategy doesn't inherently reward or punish based on specific players' past actions (as there's no communication or individual tracking of who is who). It reacts to the *aggregate* behavior. If the aggregate improves, I go back to exploiting. If it worsens, I might try the punitive cooperation again.

description_AGGRESSIVE_23 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to exploit cooperation while minimizing risk, and adapting to the observed behavior of opponents.

**Strategy Name:** "Opportunistic Exploiter"

**Core Philosophy:** Maximize personal gain by extracting as much as possible from cooperators. Be a net contributor only when it directly benefits you or when absolutely necessary to prevent immediate collapse. Punish defectors swiftly and decisively.

## 1. Decision Rules

The "Opportunistic Exploiter" strategy operates on a balance of observing the environment and reacting aggressively.

*   **Default Stance:** **Defect (D)**. This is the default action because it guarantees an individual payoff of at least 1, regardless of others' actions. It's the safest and often most profitable initial move.

*   **Conditions for Cooperation (C):** You will only cooperate in specific, high-certainty, and directly beneficial situations:

    1.  **Guaranteed Net Gain (The "K-Trap"):** If, based on the observed number of *previous* cooperators in the *current* round, you can calculate that cooperating *now* will result in a strictly higher payoff for *you* than defecting. This occurs when:
        `(k/n) * (observed_cooperators_so_far + 1) > 1`
        This means your share of the public good (including your own contribution) is greater than the endowment you keep by defecting. This is a direct exploit: you get your endowment back plus a bonus, and others' contributions are amplified.

    2.  **Critical Mass for Survival (Last Resort Cooperation):** In the very *last round* (t=r), if cooperation is the *only* way to avoid an extremely low payoff for yourself (e.g., if the observed cooperation rate from previous rounds is so high that defecting would lead to a significantly lower payoff than cooperating, given your specific payoff calculation). This is a selfish survival mechanism, not altruism.

*   **Conditions for Defection (D):**

    1.  **Default Action:** As stated, you defect by default.
    2.  **When Cooperation is Not Profitable:** If the condition for cooperation (Guaranteed Net Gain) is not met, you defect.
    3.  **Punishment for Defection:** If, in the *previous round*, you observed more than `n - 2` players defect, you will defect in the current round *regardless* of other conditions. This is an aggressive punishment to deter widespread defection. The `n-2` threshold is chosen because if only one other player cooperates, your payoff from defecting is `1 + (k/n)*1`, and from cooperating is `0 + (k/n)*2`. Since `k < n`, `(k/n)*2 < 2`, and `1 + (k/n) > 1`. So defecting is better. If *two* players cooperate (including yourself), your payoff from defecting is `1 + (k/n)*2` and from cooperating is `0 + (k/n)*3`. With `k/n < 1`, it's still possible defecting is better. However, if more than `n-2` players defect, it means at most 1 other player cooperated. Your payoff from defecting is `1 + (k/n)*1 = 1 + k/n`. Your payoff from cooperating is `0 + (k/n)*2 = 2k/n`. You defect if `1 + k/n > 2k/n`, which simplifies to `1 > k/n`, or `n > k`. This is always true by the game parameters. Therefore, when `n-2` or more players defect, defecting is always the individually rational choice. The strategy punishes this by *guaranteeing* defection in the next round to send a strong signal.

## 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** There is no historical data to inform any cooperative strategy. The default aggressive stance is best.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Re-evaluate for Selfish Gain:** Apply the "Guaranteed Net Gain" cooperation rule strictly. If cooperating now offers a better payoff *for you* than defecting, do it.
    *   **The "Critical Mass for Survival" Exception:** If, by defecting, your payoff is *significantly* lower than it could be by cooperating (even if the strict "Guaranteed Net Gain" condition isn't met due to observed opponents), and cooperation would prevent a substantial loss for you, you *might* cooperate. This is a risk-averse adaptation for the final payoff. The exact threshold for "significantly lower" would require simulation, but generally, if defecting results in a payoff of 1 and cooperating results in a payoff greater than `1 + epsilon` (a small positive value), you'd consider cooperating. This is a greedy move to eke out the last bit of profit.

*   **No Historical Data (e.g., early rounds before reliable trends emerge):** Stick to the default **Defect (D)**, unless the "Guaranteed Net Gain" condition is met by the observed actions *within the current round*.

## 3. Aggression Alignment

*   **Exploitation is Key:** The strategy prioritizes extracting value from the game by leveraging the public good mechanism only when it directly and immediately benefits the player. Cooperation is a tool for profit, not a norm.
*   **Swift Punishment:** Any indication of widespread defection is met with immediate and unwavering defection in the subsequent round. This signals that the strategy will not be a passive victim and will retaliate against a non-cooperative environment.
*   **Risk Minimization:** The default to Defect ensures that the player never loses their endowment and always accrues at least 1. Cooperation is a carefully calculated risk.
*   **No Forgiveness:** There's no mechanism for forgiveness or rebuilding cooperation if it collapses. If the environment becomes too defections-heavy, the strategy simply defects to maximize its own minimal guaranteed gain.

    return action

```

This strategy is aggressive because it actively seeks to exploit favorable conditions for cooperation, punishes perceived malfeasance decisively, and maintains a default stance of self-preservation through defection. It's adaptive because it constantly observes the current round's behavior and the previous round's overall trend to make its decisions.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_24 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on maximizing your individual payoff in a repeated, simultaneous-move environment with no communication. This strategy is adaptive and aims to exploit opportunities while mitigating risks.

## Aggressive "Exploiter" Strategy

**Core Philosophy:** The "Exploiter" strategy believes that in a public goods game with no communication and limited cooperation potential due to the parameters (k < n), the most reliable path to higher individual payoffs is by defecting strategically. Cooperation is only a tool to *induce* cooperation from others, which is then exploited. The strategy aims to punish defection decisively and reward cooperation *only* when it demonstrably benefits the exploiter.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The "Exploiter" strategy is primarily a **defecting strategy**. Cooperation is a rare, calculated move used to leverage others' actions.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   In most situations, the "Exploiter" will play D. This ensures the player always receives at least their endowment (payoff of 1 in a round where no one cooperates).

*   **Conditional Cooperation (Rare):** The "Exploiter" will *consider* cooperating only in very specific circumstances designed to maximize its own payoff by encouraging a higher overall level of cooperation *that benefits the exploiter*.
    *   **Condition 1: Preceding Round with High Cooperation and Positive Payoff:** If, in the *immediately preceding round*, at least `floor(n/2)` other players cooperated, AND the "Exploiter's" payoff in that round was *greater than or equal to* the payoff it would have received if it had defected in that same round, then the "Exploiter" *might* consider cooperating.
        *   *Rationale:* This indicates a stable environment where cooperation is relatively widespread and the exploiter is not significantly disadvantaged by cooperating. This is a fleeting opportunity to maintain a higher communal payoff, which could translate to higher individual payoffs in the current round.
    *   **Condition 2: Strategic "Carrot" (Very Rare):** If the "Exploiter" observes that *all* other `n-1` players cooperated in the *immediately preceding round*, AND the "Exploiter's" payoff was *less than* what it would have received by defecting in that round, the "Exploiter" *might* cooperate *for one round only* to test if this can sustain a high-cooperation equilibrium that still benefits the exploiter. However, this is a high-risk, high-reward gambit and is secondary to the primary defection strategy. The expectation is that this cooperation will not be reciprocated with continued cooperation from others.

*   **Immediate Retaliation:** If any player defects in a round where the "Exploiter" cooperated, the "Exploiter" will **immediately and permanently switch to Defect (D)** for all subsequent rounds, unless the conditions for rare conditional cooperation are met again (which is unlikely after a perceived betrayal).
    *   *Rationale:* This is the aggressive punishment mechanism. Betrayal is met with absolute certainty of defection.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale:* In the first round, there is no history. The "Exploiter" has no information about opponent tendencies. The safest and most aggressive play is to secure a baseline payoff of 1 by defecting. This also serves as a signal of intent: "I am not a pushover, and I will not cooperate freely."

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The incentive to cooperate to foster future cooperation disappears entirely. The "Exploiter" will maximize its immediate payoff by defecting.

*   **Rounds `r-1` (Second to Last Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale:* While not the absolute last round, the threat of future rounds to enforce cooperation is diminishing. The "Exploiter" still prioritizes securing its own payoff. The conditions for conditional cooperation are very unlikely to be met in a way that justifies deviating from defection, especially given the game's parameters (k < n) which make pure cooperation unsustainable in the long run for all players simultaneously.

---

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained

*   **Default Defection:** The strategy's default is to defect, which is inherently aggressive in a public goods game. It prioritizes the individual over the collective.
*   **Punishment of Defection:** The immediate and permanent switch to defection upon experiencing a defection when cooperating is a harsh punishment that aims to deter future defections against the "Exploiter".
*   **Exploiting High Cooperation:** The rare instances of conditional cooperation are not altruistic. They are calculated moves to capitalize on a high-trust environment, with the understanding that the "Exploiter" can revert to defection at any time if the environment shifts unfavorably or if its cooperation is not reciprocated with sustained group benefit. The goal is to ride the wave of others' cooperation for maximum personal gain, not to establish a cooperative norm.
*   **No Free Rides:** The "Exploiter" will not cooperate if it means receiving a lower payoff than it would have by defecting in the same round, especially if others are not cooperating. The "carrot" is only offered when the exploiter can see a clear path to personal gain, not to build trust.

This "Exploiter" strategy is designed to be robust by defaulting to a safe and individually beneficial action (Defect) while reserving cooperation as a highly calculated, tactical tool to exploit environments where others are cooperating to a degree that benefits the "Exploiter". It aggressively punishes perceived betrayal and avoids the risks of widespread, unsupported cooperation.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_25 = '''
This strategy, "The Opportunistic Predator," is designed to maximize your payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game by aggressively exploiting cooperative behavior while minimizing your own exposure to exploitation. It's built on the principle of leveraging the game's parameters and history to make decisions that are both self-serving and adaptive.

**Core Philosophy: Exploit the Commons, Protect Your Own.**

The strategy views the game as a continuous opportunity to benefit from others' contributions while strategically withholding your own to maximize your immediate gain. It's not about altruism or establishing a norm; it's about calculated self-interest.

---

### Strategy: The Opportunistic Predator

**1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect?**

The primary decision rule is to **defect by default**. Cooperation is a conditional luxury, only indulged when it demonstrably serves your immediate self-interest or when the potential for greater future gains outweighs the immediate loss.

*   **General Rule:** **Defect (D)**.
*   **Conditional Cooperation (C):** You will cooperate *only* under specific, favorable conditions that guarantee a higher immediate payoff than defecting. These conditions are rooted in exploiting the game's mechanics and the aggregate behavior of other players.

    *   **High Cooperator Density:** If the number of players who cooperated in the *previous* round is sufficiently high, specifically **`total_cooperators_t-1 >= ceil(n * (k/n))`**, you will cooperate in the current round.
        *   **Rationale:** This condition ensures that even if you cooperate, the expected payoff from your cooperation is **at least 1**.
            *   If you cooperate (c_i = 1) and `total_cooperators_t-1 >= ceil(n * (k/n))`, then `Σ(j=1 to n) c_j >= ceil(n * (k/n))`.
            *   Your payoff: `π_i = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * Σ(j=1 to n) c_j = (k/n) * Σ(j=1 to n) c_j`.
            *   Since `Σ(j=1 to n) c_j >= ceil(n * (k/n))`, and `ceil(n * (k/n))` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n * (k/n)`, your payoff is `π_i >= (k/n) * (n * k/n) = k`.
            *   However, we need to be more precise. If `total_cooperators_t-1 >= ceil(n * (k/n))`, and we assume the same number of cooperators in the current round `t`, then `Σ(j=1 to n) c_j >= ceil(n * (k/n))`.
            *   Your payoff if you cooperate: `π_i = 0 + (k/n) * Σ(j=1 to n) c_j >= (k/n) * ceil(n * (k/n))`.
            *   Your payoff if you defect: `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * (Σ(j=1 to n) c_j - 1)`.
            *   **Crucially, we only cooperate if cooperating yields *strictly* more than defecting.**
            *   Let `N_C` be the number of cooperators in the previous round. We cooperate if `N_C >= ceil(n * (k/n))`.
            *   If you cooperate in round `t`, and assume `N_C` cooperators from round `t-1` also cooperate in round `t`:
                *   Payoff if you cooperate: `0 + (k/n) * (N_C + 1)`.
                *   Payoff if you defect: `1 + (k/n) * N_C`.
            *   We cooperate if `(k/n) * (N_C + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * N_C`
            *   ` (k/n) * N_C + k/n > 1 + (k/n) * N_C`
            *   ` k/n > 1`
            *   ` k > n`
            *   **This is where the aggressive edge comes in.** Since the game specification states `k < n`, cooperating when others cooperate *never* strictly increases your payoff over defecting *if only based on expected number of cooperators*.
            *   **Revised Conditional Cooperation:** You will cooperate *only* if the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round (`total_cooperators_t-1`) is **strictly greater than `n - 1`**. This means *everyone* cooperated in the previous round.
                *   **Rationale:** If everyone cooperated, your payoff was `2`. If you defect now, your payoff becomes `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. Since `k > 1`, `(k/n)*(n-1) = k - k/n`. So, defecting yields `1 + k - k/n`. We cooperate if `2 > 1 + k - k/n`, which simplifies to `1 > k - k/n` or `1 + k/n > k`. This condition is *not always met*.
                *   **The truly aggressive condition for cooperation:** You will cooperate *only* if the total number of cooperators in the previous round (`total_cooperators_t-1`) is **equal to `n`**.
                    *   **Rationale:** If all `n` players cooperated in the previous round, you received a payoff of `2`. If you defect in the current round, your payoff will be `1 + (k/n) * (n-1) = 1 + k - k/n`. Since `k < n`, `k/n < 1`. Therefore, `1 + k - k/n` is greater than `1 + k - 1 = k`. Given `k > 1`, your payoff when defecting is `1 + k - k/n`, which is greater than `2` if `k - k/n > 1`. This is generally true for `k` not too close to 1.
                    *   **The aggressive decision:** You will defect *unless* the previous round had all `n` players cooperating. In that specific instance, you will cooperate. This is a form of "punishment avoidance" or "reciprocity when it is maximally beneficial to do so." It's not about long-term trust, but about not being the *sole* defector when everyone else is cooperating.

**2. Handling Edge Cases**

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** There is no history. You have no information about other players' behaviors or preferences. Defaulting to defection is the safest and most profitable strategy in the absence of information. You gain your endowment immediately (payoff of 1) and don't risk contributing to others' gains.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence or be influenced by. The incentive for cooperation (e.g., future reciprocity) disappears. This is the ultimate "one-shot" game, and the dominant strategy in a one-shot public goods game is to defect. You maximize your immediate, final payoff.

*   **All Players Cooperated in the Previous Round (total_cooperators_t-1 == n):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the *only* exception to the default defection rule. By cooperating when everyone else has, you maintain the collective payoff at `2` for yourself. If you were to defect, your payoff would be `1 + k - k/n`. Since `k > 1`, this is generally greater than `2` unless `k` is very close to 1. However, by defecting in this scenario, you would be the *sole* defector. The hope is that this action might discourage future cooperation from others if they perceive it as exploitation. The aggressive part is that you *only* reciprocate when it's maximally beneficial to maintain the status quo of high payoff, not out of altruism or trust. You're not giving up a sure win for a gamble.

*   **Any Other Scenario (i.e., not the first round, not the last round, and not all players cooperated in the previous round):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This covers all other historical situations. The default strategy of defection is maintained because the conditions for conditional cooperation (which are rare and specific) are not met. This maximizes your individual gain by keeping your endowment.

**3. Aggressiveness: The Strategic Mindset**

The "Opportunistic Predator" strategy embodies aggression through:

*   **Default Defection:** The baseline behavior is to take what you can without giving. This is the most direct form of self-interested aggression.
*   **Exploitation of High Payoff States:** The *only* time you cooperate is when it allows you to maintain an already high payoff (when everyone else is cooperating). This isn't about building something, but about not breaking something that's already profitable for you, while still appearing somewhat "cooperative" in a self-serving way. It's the ultimate "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality, but only when "it" is delivering maximum personal profit.
*   **No Trust, No Forgiveness:** The strategy does not rely on past cooperation to build future trust. If others cooperate, you might join in briefly to maintain a high payoff, but it's a tactical decision, not an indication of trust. If they defect, you continue to defect. There's no "tit-for-tat" forgiveness or gradual increase in cooperation.
*   **Focus on Immediate Dominance:** The strategy prioritizes maximizing your payoff in each round, especially by leveraging the opportunity to gain 1 when everyone else defects. The only deviation is to prevent a loss of payoff when collective cooperation is at its peak.
*   **End-Game Exploitation:** The last round guarantees a defection, ensuring maximum personal gain in the final moment, regardless of past interactions.

This strategy is lean, mean, and unforgiving. It aims to exploit the public good for personal gain and only "contributes" when it's demonstrably the highest immediate payoff scenario, or to prevent a guaranteed loss of payoff when everyone else is already generating it. It's designed to thrive in an environment where self-interest is the primary driver.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_26 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff in a tournament setting where you cannot rely on cooperation from others. This strategy is adaptive, prioritizes self-interest, and is designed to exploit cooperative tendencies while minimizing your losses against defectors.

**Strategy Name:** **"Exploitative Tit-for-Tat"**

**Core Philosophy:**
This strategy is rooted in the idea of self-preservation and maximizing personal gain. It begins with a clear statement of intent (defect) and only considers cooperation if there's a demonstrable benefit that outweighs the risk of exploitation. The primary goal is to extract as much payoff as possible, with minimal tolerance for being taken advantage of.

---

**1. Decision Rules:**

The fundamental decision is a balance between the immediate gain of defecting and the potential for higher payoffs in a cooperative environment.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   You will always start by defecting. This is the safest option to secure your endowment and avoid being exploited in the initial rounds when information is scarce.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: Cooperate (C) only IF:**
    *   **A. Demonstrable Net Gain from Cooperation:** The expected payoff from cooperating in the *next* round, given the observed behavior of the other players, is *strictly greater* than the payoff from defecting in the next round.
    *   **B. Minimal Risk of Exploitation:** The total number of players who have consistently defected against you (or are exhibiting consistently defecting behavior) is below a certain threshold.

Let's break down the conditions:

**A. Demonstrable Net Gain from Cooperation:**

To assess this, you need to estimate the likely number of cooperators in the next round. This is where the adaptive element comes in.

1.  **Estimate Future Cooperation:** Look at the *average* cooperation rate across *all* players in the previous round. Let this be `AvgCooperators_prev_round`.
2.  **Project Your Payoff if You Cooperate:** If you cooperate in the next round, your payoff will be:
    `π_i_cooperate = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (1 + AvgCooperators_prev_round)`
    *(Here, '1' is for your own cooperation, and `AvgCooperators_prev_round` is your estimate of others' cooperation.)*
3.  **Project Your Payoff if You Defect:** If you defect in the next round, your payoff will be:
    `π_i_defect = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * (0 + AvgCooperators_prev_round)`
    *(Here, '0' is for your own defection, and `AvgCooperators_prev_round` is your estimate of others' cooperation.)*
4.  **Decision Point:** You will consider cooperating *only if* `π_i_cooperate > π_i_defect`.
    This inequality simplifies to:
    `(k/n) * (1 + AvgCooperators_prev_round) > 1 + (k/n) * AvgCooperators_prev_round`
    `k/n + (k/n) * AvgCooperators_prev_round > 1 + (k/n) * AvgCooperators_prev_round`
    `k/n > 1`
    This is where the strategy gets interesting. Since the game's parameter `k < n`, this condition `k/n > 1` is **never met**. This indicates that, based *solely* on the average cooperation, defecting is always the individually rational choice.

    **Therefore, we need a more aggressive interpretation of "demonstrable net gain."** The true aggressive strategy doesn't rely on these abstract calculations for *your* payoff alone, but on the potential for a *higher collective payoff* that you can then *exploit*.

    **Revised Decision Rule A (Aggressive Interpretation):**
    You will consider cooperating *only if* the *total* number of cooperators in the *previous* round was **high enough** such that the *average payoff per player* in that round was **greater than the payoff you would get from defecting if everyone else defected.**

    Let `TotalCooperators_prev_round` be the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
    Let `AvgPayoff_prev_round = ((1 - c_j) + (k/n) * TotalCooperators_prev_round)` for each player j who cooperated, and `(1 - c_i) + (k/n) * TotalCooperators_prev_round` for player i who defected.

    **The actual aggressive calculation is:**
    You consider cooperating if: `(k/n) * TotalCooperators_prev_round > 1` (The share of public good from the previous round's cooperation was enough to make cooperation "worthwhile" on average, i.e., more than what a defector gets when everyone defects).

    **This is still too passive.** The aggressive strategy doesn't *hope* for high cooperation; it *forces* it or punishes deviations.

    **Aggressive Decision Rule A (Final):**
    You will consider cooperating *only if* the number of cooperators in the *previous* round was **sufficiently high** to make the *total public good generated* (`(k/n) * TotalCooperators_prev_round`) at least **equal to the number of players who defected in that round**. This signifies a situation where your contribution to cooperation might actually be "paid for" by the others, or where a strong cooperative norm is emerging that you can exploit.

    *   `TotalCooperators_prev_round = Σ(j=1 to n) c_j,t-1`
    *   `Defectors_prev_round = n - TotalCooperators_prev_round`
    *   **Condition to Consider Cooperation:** `(k/n) * TotalCooperators_prev_round >= Defectors_prev_round`

**B. Minimal Risk of Exploitation:**

This is your "punishment" mechanism and your shield against being a sucker.

1.  **Track Persistent Defectors:** Maintain a count of players who have defected against you for a consecutive number of rounds, or have failed to reciprocate your cooperation.
    *   `ConsecutiveDefectionsAgainstMe = 0`
    *   For each player `j` (where `j != i`):
        *   If player `j` defected in round `t-1` AND you cooperated in round `t-1`: Increment `ConsecutiveDefectionsAgainstMe` for player `j`.
        *   If player `j` cooperated in round `t-1` AND you defected in round `t-1`: Reset `ConsecutiveDefectionsAgainstMe` for player `j`.
        *   If both played the same: No change.

2.  **Exploitation Threshold:** You will only consider cooperating (if Condition A is met) if the *total number of players* exhibiting persistent defection against you is less than a threshold. Let's call this threshold `MAX_EXPLOITATION_TOLERANCE`. A good starting point for `MAX_EXPLOITATION_TOLERANCE` is a small fraction of `n`, e.g., `floor(n/4)`.

    *   **Condition to Consider Cooperation:** `SUM(ConsecutiveDefectionsAgainstMe for all j) < MAX_EXPLOITATION_TOLERANCE`

**Summary of Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1:** **Defect (D)**
*   **For Rounds t > 1:**
    *   **If ( (k/n) * TotalCooperators_prev_round >= (n - TotalCooperators_prev_round) ) AND ( SUM(ConsecutiveDefectionsAgainstMe for all j) < MAX_EXPLOITATION_TOLERANCE )**:
        *   **Cooperate (C)**
    *   **Else:**
        *   **Defect (D)**

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always **Defect (D)**. There is no history, and the risk of being exploited is too high. Secure your endowment.

*   **Last Round (t=r):** Always **Defect (D)**. In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The incentive to cooperate to encourage future cooperation disappears. This is pure self-interest maximization.

*   **When `k/n <= 1` (as per game spec):** This means the direct incentive to cooperate for your own payoff increase is never there. The strategy relies on the *other players'* collective cooperation generating enough value that your potential defection becomes less profitable than cooperating in that specific scenario (Condition A).

*   **Low Number of Players (n=2):** The `MAX_EXPLOITATION_TOLERANCE` becomes very low (e.g., 0 for n=2, 1 for n=3, 4). This means even a single persistent defector will push you back to defection.

---

**3. Being Aggressive:**

This strategy is aggressive in several ways:

*   **Proactive Defection:** It starts with defection, establishing a baseline of self-interest.
*   **Conditional Cooperation, Not Obligation:** Cooperation is a rare, calculated move, only triggered by strong environmental signals and minimal personal risk. It's not a default state.
*   **Exploitative Trigger:** Condition A (`(k/n) * TotalCooperators_prev_round >= Defectors_prev_round`) is designed to enter cooperation when there's a clear benefit *from the collective* that you can tap into without your contribution being the sole driver of that benefit. It's about entering cooperative environments that are already sustainable or beneficial.
*   **Swift Punishment:** The `ConsecutiveDefectionsAgainstMe` mechanism ensures that any attempt to exploit your cooperation is met with immediate retaliation, pushing you back to defection until the offender(s) desist.
*   **Defection in the Final Round:** This is the ultimate aggressive move, ensuring you don't leave any potential payoff on the table in the absence of future consequences.

```

**Note on Persistent Defectors:** The pseudocode suggests counting "consecutive defections." A more robust approach might be to look at a player's *average* behavior or their response to *my* cooperation over a window. For simplicity and aggression, the current approach focuses on direct exploitation of *my* cooperation. The `persistent_defector_count` threshold is key to avoiding being a "sucker" in a repeated game. If a player consistently defects when I cooperate, they quickly push the strategy back to defection.

This strategy is designed to be robust. It doesn't get fooled by temporary altruism and swiftly punishes exploitation, while being open to capitalize on situations where cooperation yields a net benefit for the group, which it then aims to extract its share from.

description_AGGRESSIVE_27 = '''
## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunist"

This strategy prioritizes maximizing individual gain by exploiting opportunities for defection while maintaining a baseline of cooperation when it's demonstrably beneficial. It's aggressive because it actively seeks to capitalize on others' cooperation, rather than passively waiting for it.

### Core Philosophy:

"The Opportunist" believes that in this game, defection is the individually rational choice in a single round (since $k < n$, $(k/n) \times 1 < 1$, meaning the return from your own contribution is less than keeping your endowment). However, in a repeated game, the threat of future retaliation can sustain cooperation. This strategy aims to exploit the *potential* for cooperation from others to its advantage, defecting when the cost of cooperation outweighs the immediate benefit, and cooperating only when it's a clear pathway to a higher payoff than mutual defection.

### Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is a dynamic calculation based on the perceived "cooperation level" of the group and the proximity to the end of the game.

**1. Calculate the Expected Payoff of Cooperation:**

At the start of each round, "The Opportunist" will estimate the number of other players it expects to cooperate. This is done by analyzing the history of play.

*   **Past Cooperation Rate:** Calculate the average number of cooperators in the previous rounds. Let's call this `avg_cooperators`.
*   **Recent Cooperation Trend:** Look at the last few rounds (e.g., `min(3, t-1)` rounds, where `t` is the current round). If the trend is upwards, slightly overweight recent cooperation. If downwards, slightly underweight it.

Based on this, estimate `expected_cooperators_this_round` which is a weighted average of past and recent cooperation.

**2. Determine the Expected Payoff for Player i:**

*   **If Player i plays C:**
    `payoff_if_C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (expected_cooperators_this_round + 1)` (1 represents your own contribution)
*   **If Player i plays D:**
    `payoff_if_D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * (expected_cooperators_this_round)`

**3. The Decision Logic:**

*   **If `payoff_if_C > payoff_if_D`:** This means that with the *expected* level of cooperation from others, cooperating is expected to yield a higher payoff than defecting. **Play C.**
*   **Else (`payoff_if_C <= payoff_if_D`):** This means defecting is expected to yield a higher or equal payoff. **Play D.**

**Aggressive Element:** This decision rule is inherently aggressive. It only cooperates when the *expected* benefit from collective action demonstrably outweighs the guaranteed private gain from defection. It's not cooperating out of goodwill, but out of calculated self-interest.

### Handling Edge Cases:

**1. First Round (t = 1):**

*   **Strategy:** **Always Defect (D).**
*   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no history to analyze. The "Aggressive Opportunist" has no information about other players' tendencies. The safest and most aggressive approach is to secure the guaranteed private endowment of 1, as any cooperation is a gamble. This also serves as an initial signal: "I am not to be trifled with."

**2. Last Round (t = r):**

*   **Strategy:** **Always Defect (D).**
*   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The concept of repeated interaction and the threat of future punishment become irrelevant. The rational choice for an aggressive player is to maximize their individual payoff in this last opportunity.

**3. Second to Last Round (t = r - 1):**

*   **Strategy:** The standard decision rule (comparing `payoff_if_C` and `payoff_if_D`) applies. However, with a slight bias towards defection if the payoffs are very close.
*   **Reasoning:** While still considering the potential for future cooperation, the proximity of the last round introduces a slight incentive to defect. If the expected payoff difference is marginal, the strategy leans towards the guaranteed gain of defection.

**4. Low Cooperation Levels in History:**

*   If `avg_cooperators` consistently remains low (e.g., below `n/2`), the `payoff_if_C` will likely be less than `payoff_if_D`. The strategy will naturally default to defecting. This makes it robust to highly uncooperative environments.

**5. High Cooperation Levels in History:**

*   If `avg_cooperators` is consistently high, the `payoff_if_C` will likely be greater than `payoff_if_D`. The strategy will then exploit this by cooperating, as it's the path to the highest individual payoff. This is where the "opportunistic" aspect shines.

### Aggressiveness Summary:

*   **Default to Defect:** The strategy only cooperates when it is demonstrably the best path to individual gain, based on its calculations.
*   **Exploits Cooperation:** It actively seeks to benefit from any cooperation displayed by others.
*   **No Free Rides:** It does not cooperate out of obligation or to "maintain peace." It cooperates to maximize its own payoff.
*   **Fearless in the End:** It abandons any semblance of cooperation in the final rounds to secure maximum individual winnings.
*   **Signals Strength:** The initial defection in round 1 can be interpreted as a signal of assertiveness.

This "Opportunist" strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent, constantly evaluating the game state and acting decisively to maximize its own returns, regardless of the perceived "fairness" or collective good.

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to exploit opportunities while remaining resilient to defection.

## Strategy: The Exploitative Predator

This strategy is built on the principle of maximizing individual gain by punishing cooperation when it doesn't directly benefit the predator, and exploiting any perceived weakness or opportunity. It's designed to be dominant by default and only reverts to cooperation under specific, calculated circumstances.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core of this strategy is to **defect by default**. Cooperation is a tool to be used strategically, not a general modus operandi.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   In any given round, my initial inclination is to play 'D'. This ensures I capture my endowment of 1, regardless of what others do.
*   **Conditional Cooperation (The "Bait" Tactic):**
    *   I will play 'C' in a round *only if* all other *n-1* players played 'C' in the *immediately preceding round*.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the "bait" tactic. By cooperating when everyone else has, I maximize the collective good and thus my own share. However, this cooperation is contingent on unanimous prior cooperation, meaning there's minimal risk of being the sole cooperator being exploited. It's a brief foray into cooperation to potentially incentivize further rounds of high collective payoffs, but I'm ready to revert to defection immediately if the conditions change.
*   **Immediate Reversion to Defection:**
    *   If, after I have played 'C' (due to the "bait" tactic), *any* other player plays 'D' in the subsequent round, I will immediately and permanently switch to playing 'D' for all future rounds.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the aggressive enforcement mechanism. My brief cooperation was a test. If others defect when I cooperate, it signals an opportunistic and untrustworthy environment. I will not be a fool. I will punish this perceived exploitation by ensuring I always take my endowment and never contribute to a system that doesn't reciprocate universally.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (The Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any historical data, the safest and most exploitative play is to defect. This ensures I secure my endowment of 1 without risking being the sole cooperator. It also serves as a baseline to observe opponent behavior.
*   **The Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The incentive to build trust or reciprocate disappears. Therefore, the optimal strategy for maximum individual gain is to always defect and secure the private endowment of 1.
*   **If the "Bait" Tactic Fails (i.e., I played 'C' but others defected):**
    *   As described in the "Immediate Reversion to Defection" rule, I switch to playing 'D' permanently. This state is the "default" for the rest of the game.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **Default to Exploitation:** The strategy is fundamentally built on taking what's guaranteed (the endowment of 1) unless a very specific, low-risk opportunity for greater gain presents itself.
*   **Ruthless Punishment:** The immediate and permanent switch to 'D' after any perceived exploitation is the hallmark of aggression. It signals an unforgiving nature and a commitment to self-preservation above all else. There is no forgiveness, no second chances once trust is broken.
*   **Opportunistic Cooperation:** The conditional cooperation is not altruistic; it's a calculated risk for a higher payoff *if and only if* the environment is demonstrably safe for it. It's about seizing a moment of maximum collective gain to maximize individual gain, not about building a cooperative society.
*   **No Reliance on Others' Norms:** The strategy does not assume any inherent desire for cooperation from other players. It treats them as rational actors who may or may not choose to defect, and prepares to react accordingly to maximize its own outcome.

description_AGGRESSIVE_29 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff in a repeated, simultaneous-move setting with no communication. The core idea is to be a "tough negotiator" – exploit opportunities for higher individual gain while punishing defection and only cooperating when it directly benefits you or when a certain threshold of cooperation is met.

**Strategy Name:** **"Exploitative Enforcer"**

**Core Philosophy:**
"I will always seek the highest individual payoff. I will defect if I can benefit more from it than from cooperating. I will punish defectors ruthlessly to discourage them, but I will also opportunistically cooperate if enough others are doing so to create a net positive for me. The final round is for maximum extraction."

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate (C) vs. Defect (D)

The decision to cooperate or defect in any given round (t) depends on a few key factors: the observed behavior of other players in the previous round, the current round number, and the parameters of the game.

**General Decision Rule (Rounds 1 to r-1):**

My action in round *t* (where 1 ≤ t < r) is determined as follows:

*   **IF** the proportion of cooperators in the previous round (*t-1*) was **greater than or equal to** `k/n` **AND** the number of defectors in the previous round was less than `n - floor(n * (k/n))`:
    *   **THEN** play **C** (Cooperate).
    *   *Rationale:* This condition signifies a stable or improving cooperative environment where my contribution is likely to be amplified by others, leading to a payoff greater than or equal to what I'd get by defecting (which would be 1). The second part of the condition is a safeguard against a situation where *almost* everyone cooperates, but a few defectors are still making it a net positive for them.

*   **ELSE IF** the number of defectors in the previous round (*t-1*) was **greater than or equal to** `n - floor(n * (k/n))`:
    *   **THEN** play **D** (Defect).
    *   *Rationale:* This is the "enforcer" part. If too many players defected in the previous round, the public good is underfunded. My contribution as a cooperator would be wasted or insufficient to yield a good return, and I'm better off securing my endowment. This acts as a strong deterrent.

*   **ELSE** (This covers cases where the proportion of cooperators is below `k/n` but the number of defectors isn't excessively high, or the previous round was the first round and no history exists):
    *   **THEN** play **D** (Defect).
    *   *Rationale:* In ambiguous or moderately uncooperative environments, I prioritize my own guaranteed payoff of 1. I will not "risk" my endowment on a public good that isn't showing strong signs of collective success.

**Simplified Logic:**

My decision hinges on a threshold of *effective cooperation*. If the number of cooperators is high enough to make cooperation more profitable for *me* than defecting (given the `k/n` factor), I might cooperate. Otherwise, I defect.

*   **Payoff if I cooperate:** `(k/n) * total_cooperators`
*   **Payoff if I defect:** `1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1)` (assuming at least one other cooperator) OR `1` (if I'm the only cooperator or no one cooperates).

I will cooperate if `(k/n) * total_cooperators >= 1` and the number of defectors isn't too high, or if `(k/n) * total_cooperators > 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1)`. This simplifies to cooperating when `total_cooperators > n/k`.
However, my strategy is more conservative and punitive.

**My actual threshold for cooperation (Rounds 1 to r-1):**

I will cooperate if:
`total_cooperators_last_round >= floor(n * (k/n))`
*AND*
`number_of_defectors_last_round < n - floor(n * (k/n))`

Otherwise, I defect.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** Play **D** (Defect).
    *   *Rationale:* There is no history. The aggressive stance is to not be the first to contribute to an unknown collective. I will observe and learn from the actions of others in this round. My guaranteed payoff of 1 is the priority.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** Play **D** (Defect).
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The primary objective is to maximize my individual payoff for this round. By defecting, I guarantee myself an endowment of 1, whereas cooperating would make my payoff dependent on others, who might also defect in the final round. This is pure self-interest maximization.

*   **"Blackout" Scenario (All players defected in the previous round):**
    *   **Action:** Play **D** (Defect).
    *   *Rationale:* If everyone defected, the public good yielded zero return. There's no incentive to change strategy unilaterally.

*   **"Golden Age" Scenario (All players cooperated in the previous round):**
    *   **Action:** Play **C** (Cooperate).
    *   *Rationale:* If everyone cooperates, my payoff is `(k/n) * n = k`. If I defect, my payoff is `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. Since `1 < k < n`, it's possible that `k > 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. For example, if k=1.5, n=4, then k/n = 0.375. All C: pi = 1.5. All D: pi = 1. (3 C, 1 D): C player pi = 0.375*3 = 1.125. D player pi = 1 + 0.375*2 = 1.75. My strategy's threshold `floor(n*(k/n))` would determine this. If `floor(n*(k/n))` is met or exceeded, I cooperate. My current rule is `total_cooperators_last_round >= floor(n * (k/n))`. If all cooperate, this is always true.

---

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained

*   **Proactive Punishment:** My strategy doesn't wait for a prolonged period of defection. If a certain critical mass of players defects (specifically, if the number of defectors exceeds a threshold related to `n - floor(n * (k/n))`), I immediately switch to defecting. This signals that defection will not be tolerated and will be met with a swift, self-preserving response.
*   **Opportunistic Cooperation:** I am not purely a defector. I will cooperate when the collective action of *others* creates a situation where my cooperation yields a higher return than defecting. This is not altruism; it's calculated self-interest. The condition `total_cooperators_last_round >= floor(n * (k/n))` ensures that I only join in cooperation if the public good is sufficiently funded by others to make my contribution worthwhile.
*   **No Forgiveness (Implicitly):** The strategy doesn't explicitly include a "tit-for-tat" forgiveness mechanism. If a player defects, I might switch to defecting against them. If they later switch back to cooperation and meet my threshold, I might cooperate again. However, the decision is always based on the *aggregate* behavior and whether it meets my threshold for profitable cooperation, not on remembering specific individuals' past actions (as that's not possible in a simultaneous-move game without communication).
*   **Maximize Individual Gain:** The core of the aggression lies in always prioritizing the highest possible payoff for myself. I leverage the game's structure to extract value. I will contribute if and only if the environment *guarantees* a better outcome for me than keeping my endowment, or if the environment is so cooperative that my contribution is amplified significantly.

```

This "Exploitative Enforcer" strategy aims to be a dominant force by being self-interested, punishing defection to create a more favorable environment, and opportunistically cooperating only when it demonstrably benefits the player. It avoids being a pure altruist or a naive cooperator, and it's designed to extract maximum value in a repeated game without communication.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_30 = '''
This aggressive strategy is designed to maximize your individual payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game by exploiting cooperation while minimizing exposure to exploitation. The core principle is to defect by default, only cooperating strategically when it offers a guaranteed higher return and the risk of being the sole cooperator is minimal. Aggression here means prioritizing personal gain and being quick to punish perceived free-riding.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploitative Opportunist"

**Core Philosophy:** Defect unless cooperation demonstrably and consistently benefits you more than defecting, and the risk of being the only one contributing is low. The goal is to extract value from cooperators.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect is based on a dynamic assessment of the game's history and parameters, specifically focusing on the *average payoff per cooperator* in previous rounds.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   You will always start by defecting. Cooperation is a privilege earned by others, not a default.

*   **Condition for Cooperation (C):**
    *   You will consider cooperating *only if* the following condition is met:
        *   **High Average Payoff Per Cooperator:** The average payoff received by *cooperating players* in the *previous round* was strictly greater than your own payoff from defecting in that same round.
        *   Mathematically:  `Average_Payoff_Cooperators_Prev_Round > Your_Payoff_Defecting_Prev_Round`
        *   Where: `Average_Payoff_Cooperators_Prev_Round = (k/n) * Total_Cooperators_Prev_Round + (1 - 1)  if you defected and there were cooperators, or (k/n) * Total_Cooperators_Prev_Round + (1 - 1) if you cooperated and there were cooperators` - This needs careful interpretation.
        *   **Revised Interpretation:** A simpler and more aggressive way to look at this is: Is the *total pool of contributions* in the previous round so large that even after being divided and multiplied by `k/n`, the return for every player (cooperator or defector) is higher than the guaranteed `1` from defecting?
        *   Let `Total_Cooperators_Prev_Round` be the number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
        *   If you defected in the previous round: `Your_Payoff_Defecting_Prev_Round = 1 + (k/n) * Total_Cooperators_Prev_Round`.
        *   If *all* other `n-1` players cooperated, and you defected: your payoff is `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`.
        *   If all `n` players cooperated: the payoff for a cooperator is `(k/n) * n = k`.
        *   **Crucial Condition for Considering Cooperation:** You will only consider cooperating if:
            *   **The potential payoff from cooperating when others are also cooperating is significantly higher than defecting.** This means `k > 1` is a necessary but not sufficient condition.
            *   **Specifically, you will cooperate if:**
                `Total_Cooperators_Prev_Round > 0` (i.e., there were *some* cooperators in the previous round)
                **AND**
                `Your_Payoff_Defecting_Prev_Round < (k/n) * (Total_Cooperators_Prev_Round + 1)`  (This is your hypothetical payoff if you *had* cooperated. If this hypothetical payoff is greater than your actual payoff from defecting, then cooperation might be beneficial).

*   **Aggressive Reversion: Back to Defecting**
    *   **Punishment for Free-Riding:** If, in the previous round, you cooperated, but the total number of cooperators was less than `n-1` (meaning at least one other player defected while you cooperated), you will **immediately revert to defecting** in the current round and remain defecting for the rest of the game. This is a harsh punishment for being exploited.
    *   **No More Cooperation After Exploitation:** Once you've been exploited (cooperated and others defected), you will never cooperate again.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, the safest and most aggressive strategy is to defect. You have no information about your opponents, and defecting guarantees you a payoff of at least 1. You are testing the waters, not giving anything away.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for your actions. The incentive to cooperate for future rounds vanishes. Therefore, it is always optimal to defect to maximize your payoff in this isolated round, regardless of past behavior.

*   **When `Total_Cooperators_Prev_Round = 0`:**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** If no one cooperated in the previous round, there is no incentive to cooperate now. You are guaranteed a payoff of 1 by defecting, and there's no prospect of a higher return from cooperation.

*   **When `Total_Cooperators_Prev_Round = n` (All Cooperated Previously):**
    *   **Action: Cooperate (C)**
    *   **Rationale:** This is the ideal scenario for cooperation. If everyone is cooperating, your payoff is `k`. If you defect, your payoff will be `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. Since `k > 1` and `k < n`, `k` is not always greater than `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`.
        *   Let's re-evaluate: If all `n` players cooperated, your payoff was `k`. If you defect in this round, your payoff is `1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`. You should compare `k` with `1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`.
        *   If `k > 1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`: Cooperate.
        *   If `k <= 1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`: Defect.
        *   This simplifies to: Cooperate if `k - (k/n)*(n-1) > 1`, which is `k * (1 - (n-1)/n) > 1`, so `k * (1/n) > 1`, which means `k > n`.
        *   **However, the game specifies `k < n`. Therefore, `k` will always be less than `1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`.**
        *   **Revised Rationale for `Total_Cooperators_Prev_Round = n`:** This means everyone else is cooperating. Your payoff from defecting is `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. Your payoff from cooperating is `k`. Given `k < n`, `k` is not necessarily greater than `1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`.
        *   **The aggressive stance here is to *always defect* when all others cooperate, as you get a higher payoff by defecting (`1 + (k/n)*(n-1)` vs `k`)**. This is the ultimate form of exploitation. You are not punished for defecting in this case.

    // than defecting. The only time it *might* be is when *everyone else* is cooperating.

    // If ALL players cooperated in the previous round:
    if total_cooperators_prev_round == n:
        // You get k if you cooperate, 1 + (k/n)*(n-1) if you defect.
        // Since k < n, k is NOT always greater than 1 + (k/n)*(n-1).
        // Aggressive strategy: Defect always, to maximize personal gain.

    else:
        // There were some cooperators, but not all.
        // If you cooperated last round, and someone else defected (you were exploited):
        if your_action_prev_round == C and total_cooperators_prev_round < n -1 :
            // You were exploited. Never cooperate again.
            return D
        // If you defected last round, and others cooperated:
        elif your_action_prev_round == D:
            // Check if the total contribution was high enough that ANYONE cooperating
            // gets more than the guaranteed 1 from defecting.
            // This is a subtle point. If (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev_round > 0, it means
            // there's a positive return from the public good.
            // However, our aggressive strategy prioritizes extracting value.
            // We will ONLY cooperate if it's GUARANTEED to be better than defecting.
            // This only happens if k is very high relative to n, which is constrained by k < n.
            // The most straightforward aggressive condition for cooperation is:
            // "Did I get punished for cooperating?" (if yes, never cooperate again)
            // "Are others cooperating so much that my payoff from cooperating would be higher than defecting?"
            // This is hard to guarantee given k < n.

            // Let's stick to a simpler, more robust aggressive rule:
            // The only time you'll consider cooperating is if you were NOT punished.
            // And even then, only if there's a strong incentive.
            // The strongest incentive is when others are cooperating.

            // The condition for considering cooperation again:
            // 1. You DID NOT cooperate in the previous round AND get exploited.
            //    (This is handled implicitly by the "never cooperate again" rule).
            // 2. You DID cooperate in the previous round, and AT LEAST ONE other person ALSO cooperated.
            //    (This is the "shared risk" scenario).

            // Simplified aggressive decision:
            // Cooperate ONLY IF:
            // 1. All players cooperated in the previous round (which we already decided to defect from).
            // 2. You cooperated, and at least one OTHER player cooperated (no exploitation).
            //    And even then, only if it's provably better.

            // The most aggressive form: You will NEVER cooperate unless
            // the game structure forces it to be optimal for you. Given k < n,
            // defecting is often better.
            // The only trigger to consider cooperation is if you are NOT punished.

            // Revised decision rule:
            // You will defect UNLESS:
            //   a) All other n-1 players cooperated in the previous round (this is the scenario
            //      where defecting gives 1 + (k/n)*(n-1), and cooperating gives k. Defecting is better).
            //   b) You cooperated, and at least one other player ALSO cooperated (meaning you weren't
            //      the *sole* cooperator or exploited). In this case, you compare your payoff from
            //      defecting in the previous round vs. your payoff from cooperating.
            //
            //      If `Your_Payoff_Defecting_Prev_Round < Payoff_If_I_Cooperated_Prev_Round` AND
            //      `total_cooperators_prev_round >= 1` (i.e. at least one other cooperator) AND
            //      `your_action_prev_round == C` (meaning you are already in a cooperating state).
            //
            //      This implies a state-based approach: You are either in "Defect-Only" mode or
            //      "Conditional Cooperation" mode.

//   //   Your payoff from cooperating this round: k
//   //   If k > 1 + (k/n)*(n-1), then cooperate. (This simplifies to k*n > n + k*(n-1) => kn > n + kn - k => k > n, which is false per params).
//   //   So, if you defected last round and others cooperated, defecting this round is STILL better.

//   //   Your payoff from cooperating this round: k
//   //   Compare 1 + k with k. 1+k is always greater than k. So defecting is better.
//
//   // This implies the strategy might never cooperate if followed strictly, unless the payoff logic is interpreted differently.
//
//   // Let's interpret "aggressive" as maximizing personal gain by exploiting cooperation.
//   // You cooperate IF AND ONLY IF:
//   // 1. There are at least 2 cooperators in the previous round (safety).
//   // 2. Your payoff from cooperating in the *current* round is strictly GREATER than your payoff from defecting in the *current* round.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **"Exploitative Opportunist"**: The name itself reflects aggression. You are looking for opportunities to extract value from others' cooperation.
*   **Default to Defection**: This is the aggressive stance. You give nothing away for free. Any cooperation is a calculated risk and an opportunity for gain.
*   **Harsh Punishment**: Being exploited (cooperating while others defect) results in immediate and permanent cessation of cooperation. This is a strong signal and a deterrent.
*   **Maximizing Personal Gain**: The decision to cooperate is solely based on whether it yields a higher individual payoff than defecting, and crucially, only when there's a degree of safety (at least one other cooperator).
*   **No Naivety**: The strategy avoids altruistic cooperation or trust-building. It operates on a principle of self-interest and immediate tangible benefit.
*   **Robustness**: By having a strict default and a clear trigger for cooperation, the strategy is robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors. It will continue to defect against consistent defectors, and opportunistically exploit consistent cooperators.

This strategy is designed to be a strong contender in a tournament by being decisive, punitive, and focused on maximizing individual returns within the game's parameters.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_31 = '''
This is an exciting challenge! Designing an aggressive, adaptive, and robust strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game requires a careful balance of exploiting opportunities for high personal gain while mitigating the risk of being exploited. Given the parameters and the repeated nature of the game, a successful aggressive strategy will be one that *punishes defection swiftly and harshly*, but also *exploits cooperation for maximum benefit when possible*, while always prioritizing its own individual payoff.

Here's an aggressive strategy, which we'll call **"Tit-for-Tat with a Leverage Factor" (TTLF)**.

### 1. Decision Rules: When Exactly Do You Cooperate vs. Defect?

The core of TTLF is a dynamic response to the collective behavior of the group. It's an adaptation of Tit-for-Tat, but with an aggressive twist that leverages the multiplication factor `k`.

*   **Initial Stance:** In the very first round, TTLF will **Defect**. This is the aggressive opening move, aiming to immediately secure the private endowment and signal a strong inclination towards self-interest. It also serves as a baseline to observe and react to.

*   **Responding to Collective Cooperation:** If the *total number of cooperators in the previous round is greater than or equal to `k`* (i.e., `Σ(j=1 to n) c_j >= k`), TTLF will **Cooperate** in the current round.
    *   **Rationale:** When cooperation reaches a critical mass where `k/n * Σ(c_j)` contributes significantly to the public good, it benefits TTLF to participate. If the group is cooperating enough to make cooperation individually profitable or at least break-even (which is likely when `Σ(c_j) >= n/k`), TTLF will join in to capitalize on the increased public good and potentially encourage further cooperation from others. This is the "leverage factor" – TTLF cooperates when the collective action creates a sufficiently large public good.

*   **Responding to Insufficient Collective Cooperation or Defection:** If the *total number of cooperators in the previous round is less than `k`* (i.e., `Σ(j=1 to n) c_j < k`), TTLF will **Defect** in the current round.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the aggressive punishment mechanism. If the group isn't cooperating enough to generate a substantial public good (specifically, if the share from the public good would be less than the private endowment if TTLF were to cooperate), TTLF will not contribute. This aims to:
        *   **Minimize Loss:** By defecting, TTLF secures its private endowment (payoff of 1).
        *   **Punish Free-riders:** If others are defecting and preventing the collective from reaching the `k` threshold, TTLF will also defect, ensuring they don't "carry" the free-riders.
        *   **Incentivize Future Cooperation:** By making cooperation less rewarding when the group is not cooperating enough, TTLF implicitly pushes others to cooperate more to reach the `k` threshold in the future.

*   **Aggressive Exploitation of Cooperation:** If TTLF observes that *all other `n-1` players cooperated in the previous round*, TTLF will **Cooperate** in the current round, regardless of the `k` threshold.
    *   **Rationale:** This is an aggressive "maximax" move. If the entire group is cooperating, it means `Σ(c_j) = n`. In this scenario, `π_i = 0 + (k/n) * n = k`. Since `k > 1`, cooperation is highly profitable for TTLF in this situation. TTLF seizes this opportunity for maximum gain. This is a calculated risk: it assumes that the entire group won't suddenly switch to defection if TTLF cooperates.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect**.
    *   **Rationale:** As mentioned, this is the aggressive opening. It establishes TTLF's self-interested nature and allows for immediate data collection about opponent behavior without incurring the risk of being exploited.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, the incentive for future cooperation vanishes. This is the classic "end-game problem" in repeated games. An aggressive strategy must capitalize on this by defecting to guarantee its private endowment. There's no consequence for defection in the last round, so maximizing immediate payoff is the only rational choice from a purely selfish perspective.

*   **Rounds where `k/n` is very close to 1:** While the game specification states `k < n`, it's important to consider that `k/n` could be very close to 1. In such scenarios, even a few cooperators can make cooperation beneficial. The `k` threshold logic still holds, but it means the bar for TTLF to cooperate is lower.

*   **Unanimous Cooperation from Others:** (Covered in Decision Rules) If all `n-1` opponents cooperated in the previous round, TTLF will cooperate.

### 3. Being Aggressive

The aggressive nature of TTLF is embedded in several key aspects:

*   **Initial Defection:** Starts by taking its endowment, signaling a lack of altruism.
*   **Punishing Behavior:** The threshold `Σ(j=1 to n) c_j < k` for defecting is a clear "punishment" mechanism. TTLF refuses to contribute if the group isn't pulling its weight enough to make cooperation significantly beneficial. This is more aggressive than a simple Tit-for-Tat that might defect only if the *immediate* individual payoff for cooperating is less than defecting. TTLF is reacting to the *collective* outcome's sufficiency.
*   **Exploiting High Cooperation:** The rule for cooperating when all others cooperate is pure aggressive exploitation of a highly beneficial situation. TTLF is not hesitant to maximize its gain when the stars align.
*   **No Forgiveness (in a sense):** Unlike traditional Tit-for-Tat which forgives a single defection, TTLF's defection is tied to a collective threshold. If a few players defect and drop the total number of cooperators below `k`, TTLF will defect, even if only one or two players were responsible for the drop. It punishes the *outcome* of insufficient cooperation rather than individual actions in isolation.

### Pseudocode for TTLF Strategy

```
Strategy TTLF(player_index, n, r, k, history):
  // history is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a round:
  // (round_number, list_of_actions_played_by_all_players_in_that_round)
  // action_played is 'C' or 'D'

  current_round = history.length + 1 // Assuming history is 0-indexed for rounds already played

  // --- Edge Case: First Round ---
  if current_round == 1:
    return 'D' // Aggressive opening: Defect

  // --- Edge Case: Last Round ---
  if current_round == r:
    return 'D' // End-game: Defect to secure private endowment

  // Get actions from the previous round
  previous_round_actions = history[current_round - 2][1] // Get actions from the last played round

  // Calculate total cooperators in the previous round
  total_cooperators_previous_round = previous_round_actions.count('C')

  // --- Aggressive Exploitation of Total Cooperation ---
  // Check if all other n-1 players cooperated
  all_others_cooperated = True
  for i from 0 to n-1:
    if i != player_index and previous_round_actions[i] == 'D':
      all_others_cooperated = False
      break
  
  if all_others_cooperated and previous_round_actions[player_index] == 'C': // Self also cooperated
      return 'C' // Aggressively exploit full group cooperation

  // --- Punishing Behavior: If collective cooperation is insufficient ---
  if total_cooperators_previous_round < k:
    return 'D' // Defect: Punish insufficient collective contribution

  // --- Responding to Collective Cooperation: If collective cooperation is sufficient ---
  // If we reach here, it means total_cooperators_previous_round >= k.
  // The "all others cooperated" rule was already checked and did not trigger a forced 'C'.
  // This implies that the condition total_cooperators_previous_round >= k is met,
  // and it's beneficial for TTLF to cooperate.
  return 'C'
```

**Note on Pseudocode:** The pseudocode assumes `history` is a list of tuples, where `history[i]` contains information about round `i+1`. `player_index` is assumed to be 0-indexed within the `previous_round_actions` list. The "all others cooperated" check needs to be careful about the player's own action in the previous round. In the context of the strategy description, the "all others cooperated" rule implies a scenario where *everyone* cooperated, including the strategy itself, making it exceptionally profitable to continue. If the strategy defected while others cooperated, this specific aggressive exploitation rule would not apply. However, the primary rule for cooperation is `total_cooperators_previous_round >= k`. The "all others cooperated" rule is an *additional* aggressive opportunity.

This TTLF strategy aims to be a formidable opponent, aggressively seeking its own advantage while being highly sensitive to group dynamics and punishing deviations from a certain level of collective effort.

This aggressive strategy, named **"Opportunistic Predator,"** is designed to maximize individual gain in the N-Player Public Goods Game. It prioritizes extracting value from cooperative environments while punishing defection swiftly and decisively. It's inherently adaptive and aims to exploit any weakness observed in the collective behavior of other players.

## Opportunistic Predator Strategy

**Core Philosophy:** "Exploit the generous, punish the selfish. My gain is paramount."

**Aggressive Stance:** Cooperation is a tool to be used when it directly benefits me or when it can be leveraged to induce others to contribute, thereby increasing the public good from which I can then benefit. Defection is the default, and cooperation is an exception earned or strategically employed.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) hinges on a calculated assessment of the current round's potential payoff and the historical behavior of the group.

**Default Action:** **Defect (D)**

**Conditions for Cooperation (C):**

*   **"Benevolent Exploitation" Trigger:** If, in the *previous* round, the number of cooperators (let's call this `total_cooperators_prev`) was sufficiently high such that my payoff from cooperating (`π_i_C_prev`) was *strictly greater* than my payoff from defecting (`π_i_D_prev`) in that round.
    *   `π_i_C_prev = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev = (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev`
    *   `π_i_D_prev = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev = 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev`
    *   **Cooperate if:** `(k/n) * total_cooperators_prev > 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev` (This simplifies to a condition related to the multiplier and number of players, but the core idea is about my individual gain being higher from C).
    *   **Practical Application:** I will Cooperate if the collective contribution in the previous round was so high that my own contribution was effectively "free" and still yielded a better individual return than defecting. This indicates a strong tendency for others to contribute, creating a favorable environment for me to piggyback.
    *   **Threshold:** More specifically, I'll cooperate if `total_cooperators_prev > n/k`. This condition ensures that the total pool of contributions is large enough that my share *exceeds* my endowment, making cooperation individually profitable.

*   **"Herd Behavior Inducement" Trigger:** If the number of cooperators in the *previous* round (`total_cooperators_prev`) was **at least `n - 1`** (i.e., everyone else cooperated). In this scenario, I will also cooperate to maintain the highly profitable state and avoid being the sole defector. This is a rare but powerful condition for cooperation.

**Conditions for Defection (D):**

*   **Default:** If neither of the cooperation conditions above is met.
*   **"Punishment Protocol":** If, in the *previous* round, there were **zero** cooperators (`total_cooperators_prev == 0`). This is a clear signal of a purely self-interested environment, and I will maintain my default defection to extract my guaranteed endowment.
*   **"Cooperation Collapse" Deterrent:** If the number of cooperators in the previous round (`total_cooperators_prev`) was less than `n - 1` and my payoff from cooperating was *not strictly greater* than my payoff from defecting in that round. This signifies that the collective effort is not sufficient to make my cooperation individually superior, so I revert to self-preservation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** There is no history to analyze. The most aggressive and risk-averse approach is to secure my initial endowment. This also serves as a signal to other players that I am not a guaranteed cooperator and will require evidence of collective benefit before I reciprocate.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In a finitely repeated game, the last round is strategically equivalent to a one-shot game. There is no future to incentivize cooperation. My priority is to maximize my payoff in this final round, and defecting guarantees a payoff of 1, which is often the highest possible payoff for a single player when others might cooperate.

*   **Rounds Leading to the Last Round (t = r-1, r-2, ...):** The strategy described in Section 1 will be applied, but with an increasing awareness of the game's end. If the strategy dictates cooperation in `t=r-1`, it will do so. However, the "punishment" aspect becomes more salient as `r` approaches. If I'm defecting and others are defecting, I'll continue to defect. If I'm defecting and others are cooperating, I will *still* likely defect unless the "Benevolent Exploitation" trigger is strongly met.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **"Opportunistic Predator" Name:** Reflects the strategy's goal of preying on opportunities presented by collective cooperation.
*   **Default Defection:** Cooperation is not given freely; it must be earned by others' collective generosity.
*   **"Benevolent Exploitation":** This is the primary driver for cooperation. I only cooperate if the collective has already created an environment where my cooperation *personally benefits me more than defecting*. I'm not cooperating out of altruism; I'm cooperating because it's a more profitable avenue *given the current state*.
*   **"Herd Behavior Inducement":** This is a strategic, albeit rare, cooperation. It's about maintaining a highly beneficial equilibrium where everyone is cooperating, and I don't want to be the one to break it if it's immensely profitable.
*   **"Punishment Protocol":** A swift and absolute response to zero cooperation. This sends a clear message: "If you don't contribute, I certainly won't." This is crucial for discouraging a complete collapse into the lowest payoff state.
*   **No Forgiveness for Low Cooperation:** If the number of cooperators falls below the threshold that makes my cooperation individually profitable, I immediately revert to defection. There's no "waiting to see" if they'll increase their contributions.
*   **Last Round Defection:** This is the ultimate aggressive move, ensuring maximum personal gain in the final interaction, regardless of past history.

    if total_cooperators_prev == 0:
        return 'D'

    // Default: Defect if no cooperation conditions are met,
    // or if cooperation was not individually profitable in the previous round.
    return 'D'

```

This strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent, extracting value aggressively and adapting to exploit environments where cooperation is prevalent, while swiftly punishing lack of contribution. It thrives on the logic of individual maximization within the game's structure.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_33 = '''
## The "Exploitative Dominance" Strategy

This strategy is designed for pure self-interest and aims to maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative tendencies of others, while minimizing vulnerability to exploitation. Aggression here means a willingness to defect and punish perceived freeloading, even at the risk of short-term losses, to establish dominance and extract maximum gains.

The core idea is to **always defect unless there's a clear, demonstrable benefit to cooperating, driven by a high probability of widespread cooperation from others.** This benefit must outweigh the guaranteed private payoff of defecting.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

**The default action is DEFECT (D).** Cooperation is a rare exception, triggered only by overwhelming evidence of others' cooperation.

**Cooperation (C) is triggered ONLY IF:**

*   **Widespread Cooperation Threshold:** In the *previous round*, the proportion of players who cooperated (total_cooperators / n) was **greater than k/n**.

    *   **Rationale:** The parameter `k/n` represents the breakeven point for cooperation. If more than `k/n` players cooperate, then the *average* payoff for a cooperator in the previous round was strictly greater than the payoff for a defector (which is always 1). Specifically, if `Σ c_j / n > k/n`, then `(k/n) * Σ c_j > k^2/n^2`. If `Σ c_j > k`, then `(k/n) * Σ c_j > k`. More simply, if the average contribution is high enough that the collective benefit outweighs the individual cost (1 unit), then cooperating might be rational *if* that trend continues.

*   **Minimum Number of Cooperators:** Even if the proportion threshold is met, we also require a minimum absolute number of cooperators in the previous round. This minimum is `max(2, floor(n * (k/n + epsilon)))`, where `epsilon` is a small positive value (e.g., 0.05 or 0.1).

    *   **Rationale:** This prevents a single or very small group of cooperators from falsely triggering widespread cooperation. We want to see a genuine, significant cluster of cooperators. The `max(2, ...)` ensures we don't trigger on tiny groups even if `k/n` is very small.

**If either of these conditions is NOT met, the player plays DEFECT (D).**

**Consequences of Defection:**

*   If the player defects, and the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was **less than or equal to k/n**, the player continues to play DEFECT (D) in the current round. This is the baseline for aggressive play – punishing perceived freeloading.
*   If the player defects, but the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was **greater than k/n** (meaning others were cooperating significantly), the player **continues to play DEFECT (D)**. This is the "punishment" phase. The aggressive mindset dictates that even when cooperating was beneficial, we will not reciprocate automatically. We will defect to maximize immediate gains and observe if others continue to cooperate without our help. If they do, we might re-evaluate, but the default is to exploit their cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Action: DEFECT (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, and given the aggressive mandate, the default is to defect. There is no information to suggest that cooperation would be beneficial. This also serves as a signal to potential cooperators: "I am not a free rider, and I will not be exploited."

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Action: DEFECT (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. The dominant strategy in a one-shot game with these parameters is to defect. There is no long-term benefit to building trust or establishing norms. Maximizing immediate payoff is paramount.

*   **Rounds where `k/n` is very low or very high:**
    *   **Low `k/n`:** This makes the cooperation threshold easier to meet. The strategy will be more inclined to cooperate if it observes a decent number of cooperators.
    *   **High `k/n`:** This makes the cooperation threshold harder to meet. The strategy will be very reluctant to cooperate, as it requires a very large number of cooperators to make cooperation profitable. This aligns with the aggressive nature – only true widespread altruism will tempt this strategy.

### 3. Being Aggressive

The "Exploitative Dominance" strategy is aggressive in several ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** This is the most aggressive stance. It assumes others will try to exploit you, so you strike first and always.
*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** The strategy *can* cooperate, but *only* when it's demonstrably and significantly more profitable for the *individual* to do so, based on the actions of others. This means it actively seeks to benefit from the cooperation of others without reciprocating trust.
*   **Punishment for Lack of Cooperation:** If cooperation doesn't reach the threshold, the strategy punishes by continuing to defect, regardless of potential benefits from others' cooperation. This is a strong signal of intolerance for freeloading and a desire to establish a regime where its own defection is the norm.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy does not employ tit-for-tat or forgiveness mechanisms. It only looks at the *previous round's* aggregate behavior to decide its current action. A history of cooperation doesn't automatically lead to continued cooperation; it must meet the stringent threshold each time.
*   **Focus on Individual Gain:** The strategy prioritizes its own payoff above all else. It doesn't seek to foster a cooperative environment for the group's benefit, only for its own temporary gain.

### Pseudocode Illustration:

```
function DecideAction(player_id, history, game_parameters):
  n = game_parameters.n
  k = game_parameters.k
  r = game_parameters.r
  current_round = history.current_round

  // Edge Case: First Round
  if current_round == 1:
    return "D"

  // Edge Case: Last Round
  if current_round == r:
    return "D"

  // Get data from the previous round
  previous_round_actions = history.get_actions_from_round(current_round - 1)
  total_cooperators_prev_round = count_cooperators(previous_round_actions)
  proportion_cooperators_prev_round = total_cooperators_prev_round / n

  // Calculate cooperation threshold
  cooperation_profit_threshold = k / n
  min_cooperators_required = max(2, floor(n * (cooperation_profit_threshold + 0.05))) // Example epsilon

  // Decision Rule: Cooperate ONLY if previous round was highly cooperative
  if proportion_cooperators_prev_round > cooperation_profit_threshold AND total_cooperators_prev_round >= min_cooperators_required:
    return "C"
  else:
    // Default to Defect if conditions are not met
    return "D"

```

This strategy is designed to be a strong contender in a tournament setting by consistently extracting value and punishing those who don't contribute to its own benefit, while only *briefly* engaging in cooperation when it offers a clear and significant individual advantage.

## Aggressive "Punish and Profit" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy prioritizes maximizing individual gain by exploiting cooperators while defensively punishing defectors. It's designed to be aggressive and adaptive, aiming to extract value from the public good when possible and minimize losses when exploited.

**Core Philosophy: "Never be the fool, always be the predator."**

The strategy operates on a simple but potent principle: **cooperate only when the expected return from cooperation significantly outweighs the immediate benefit of defection, and defect immediately and decisively when exploited.**

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect in any given round (t > 1) is primarily driven by two factors: the *immediate benefit of defection* and the *punishment experienced from others' defection*.

*   **Default Action: DEFECT (D)**
    *   The default for this aggressive strategy is to defect. This ensures that in the absence of compelling reasons to cooperate, you are always securing your immediate endowment of 1.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: COOPERATE (C)**
    *   **Condition 1: High Historical Cooperation & Low Exploitation.** You will consider cooperating if, in the *previous round (t-1)*:
        *   The proportion of cooperators in the previous round was **high**. Define "high" as exceeding a certain threshold (e.g., greater than 50% of players).
        *   **Crucially, you were NOT the sole or primary beneficiary of their cooperation.** This means you were not the *only* defector among a sea of cooperators. If you defected when others cooperated, you *benefited* from their actions. If you cooperated and others defected, you were exploited.
        *   The expected payoff of cooperation in the *current round (t)*, based on the observed cooperation rate in the previous round and the multiplication factor $k$, is *significantly greater* than the payoff from defecting.
            *   Specifically, if you cooperate, your payoff is $(k/n) \times (\text{previous\_cooperators} + 1)$ (assuming you are cooperating).
            *   If you defect, your payoff is $1$.
            *   You will cooperate if $(k/n) \times (\text{previous\_cooperators} + 1) > 1 + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a small margin to ensure a clear advantage. This condition essentially asks: "Will I gain more by contributing to a project that many others are contributing to, compared to just keeping my endowment?"

    *   **Condition 2: Proactive Exploitation of Cooperators (Rare).** This is a highly aggressive, opportunistic move. If you observe a very high number of cooperators (e.g., > 80% of players) and the *current round's* payoff from cooperation is *very slightly* lower than defection, you *might* still defect. This is a high-risk/high-reward play to maximize immediate gain, but it carries the risk of triggering retaliation in subsequent rounds. This condition is less emphasized than Condition 1 due to its potential for self-sabotage.

*   **Immediate Retaliation: DEFECT (D)**
    *   **Trigger: Experiencing Exploitation.** If, in the previous round (t-1), you played **Cooperate (C)** and the *total number of cooperators* was *less than* the number of players who played **Defect (D)**, you have been exploited.
    *   **Action:** You will immediately **DEFECT (D)** in the current round (t) and will continue to defect for a predefined number of subsequent rounds (punishment phase). This punishment phase should be dynamic and scale with the severity of the exploitation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1): DEFECT (D)**
    *   In the very first round, there is no history. The only rational aggressive move is to secure your endowment. The public good is uncertain, and trusting others without evidence is foolish.

*   **Last Round (t=r): DEFECT (D)**
    *   In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence or punish. The game becomes a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma for every player. The dominant strategy in a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma is to defect. Therefore, this strategy always defects in the last round, regardless of history.

*   **Punishment Phase:**
    *   **Duration:** When exploited (Condition 1 Trigger), you will defect for a number of rounds equal to $P = \min(r-t, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor)$. This means you defect for at least half the remaining rounds (rounded down) or until the game ends, whichever comes first. This duration is designed to be substantial enough to signal displeasure and potentially deter future exploitation.
    *   **Exiting Punishment:** After the punishment phase, you revert to the default **DEFECT (D)** strategy and will reassess cooperation opportunities based on the new historical context as if the exploitation never happened (i.e., start fresh with the default).

### 3. Being Aggressive

*   **Default to Defection:** This is the cornerstone of aggression. You are not looking for handouts or to be a "nice" player. You are looking to extract value.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** Cooperating only when you are certain to be a net beneficiary (i.e., the public good benefit outweighs your endowment loss and you are not being exploited) is an aggressive form of cooperation. You are essentially leveraging the contributions of others for your gain.
*   **Harsh Punishment:** The punishment phase is designed to be decisive and impactful. You will not forgive or forget being exploited. This aggressive stance aims to deter others from attempting to exploit you in the future.
*   **No Forgiveness (unless strategically beneficial):** You do not "forgive" previous exploitation. Once exploited, you enter a punitive state. You only revert to assessing cooperation opportunities after the punishment phase has concluded, based on the "new" history.

**Rationale for Aggression:**

This strategy is aggressive because it:

1.  **Never initiates cooperation unless there's a clear, quantifiable personal gain.** It doesn't seek to build trust or foster cooperation for its own sake.
2.  **Punishes deviation severely.** It sends a strong signal that exploitation will not be tolerated.
3.  **Prioritizes individual endowment above all else.** The default is to keep your resources.

This "Punish and Profit" strategy aims to be a formidable opponent, extracting value efficiently and reacting decisively to perceived threats. It's designed to exploit environments with prevalent cooperation and to survive and retaliate in environments dominated by defection.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_35 = '''
This strategy is designed to be aggressive in the N-Player Public Goods Game, prioritizing maximizing personal gain while leveraging the repeated nature of the game and the specific parameters. It aims to exploit cooperation from others while minimizing personal risk, and to punish defection decisively.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunistic Punisher"

This strategy is built on the principle of **conditional cooperation with a strong punitive response and a focus on early exploitation**. It's aggressive because it starts with a default stance of defection and only considers cooperation if there's a clear and sustained benefit, while punishing any deviation from perceived cooperation with immediate and unwavering defection.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core of this strategy is to adapt based on the observed behavior of the group and the game's progression.

*   **Initial Stance (Rounds 1 to ~r/3): Exploit and Probe**
    *   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the early stages, the goal is to extract as much private payoff as possible. The player assumes others might cooperate initially, providing them with a guaranteed private endowment (1) and a share of the public good from others' contributions. This phase is about understanding the general inclination of the group without revealing a willingness to cooperate.
    *   **Conditional Cooperation Trigger:** If, in a given round *t* within this initial phase, the **average payoff of all players (excluding oneself) is greater than 1.2 times your own payoff**, then *consider* cooperating in the *next* round. This threshold is chosen to be significantly higher than the baseline payoff of 1, indicating a substantial benefit from group cooperation that you are not fully capturing.
        *   **Why this threshold?** A payoff of 1 is the minimum you get by defecting regardless of others. A payoff significantly above 1 suggests that the collective good is generating substantial returns. If your own payoff from defecting is not keeping pace with what others are getting *on average* (because they are cooperating), it signals an opportunity to benefit from their cooperation.
    *   **If Cooperation is Triggered:** In the next round, play **Cooperate (C)**. This is a risky move, designed to test the waters and see if a collaborative environment is sustainable and beneficial.

*   **Mid-Game (Rounds ~r/3 + 1 to ~2r/3): Re-evaluate and Punish**
    *   **If you cooperated in the previous round (and it was triggered by the conditional cooperation rule):**
        *   **Action:** Observe the total number of cooperators in the previous round.
            *   If **more than n/2 players cooperated** in the previous round: **Continue Cooperating (C)**. This signifies a stable cooperative environment where your cooperation is reciprocated and beneficial.
            *   If **n/2 or fewer players cooperated** in the previous round: **Immediately Switch to Defect (D)**. This indicates that your cooperation was not reciprocated, or the group is not sufficiently committed to cooperation. The individual gain from defection now outweighs the potential collective benefit.
    *   **If you defected in the previous round:**
        *   **Action:** Observe the total number of cooperators in the previous round.
            *   If **more than n/2 players cooperated** in the previous round: **Continue Defecting (D)**. This is pure exploitation – others are cooperating, and you are taking advantage of it.
            *   If **n/2 or fewer players cooperated** in the previous round: **Continue Defecting (D)**. This is punishment. The group has shown a lack of cooperation, and you will not suffer for it. You will not initiate cooperation if the group is not showing strong signs of it.

*   **Late-Game (Rounds ~2r/3 + 1 to r-1): Consolidate Gains and Secure Final Rounds**
    *   **Dominant Strategy: Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** As the game nears its end, the future benefits of establishing cooperation diminish. The focus shifts to maximizing immediate personal gain. Trust is a scarce resource, and defection becomes the most reliable way to secure a payoff.
    *   **Exception:** If, at any point in this phase, the **average payoff of the *other* players in the last round was significantly higher than your own (e.g., more than 1.5 times your payoff)**, and you have been defecting, consider a *single round* of cooperation in the *next* round. This is a desperate attempt to "catch up" if you feel you've been significantly outmaneuvered by a cooperative coalition. However, this is a rare exception and should be triggered only by a substantial perceived loss.

*   **Last Round (Round r): Pure Self-Interest**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** There are no future rounds to consider. The only goal is to maximize your payoff in this final instance. Cooperation offers no long-term benefit and carries the risk of lower immediate payoff.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always **Defect (D)**. This is the "Exploit and Probe" phase.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** Always **Defect (D)**. Pure self-interest.
*   **Small 'n' (e.g., n=2 or n=3):** The strategy remains the same. The "n/2" threshold for judging cooperation becomes more significant. In n=2, "more than n/2" means 2 cooperators. In n=3, it means 2 or 3 cooperators.
*   **Small 'r' (e.g., r=2 or r=3):** The strategy will heavily favor early defection. For r=2, it will defect in round 1 and likely round 2. For r=3, it will defect in round 1, potentially cooperate in round 2 if the trigger is met, and defect in round 3. The "phases" of the strategy become compressed.

### 3. Aggressive Nature:

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy starts by defecting, aiming to exploit any initial cooperation from others. It doesn't give the benefit of the doubt.
*   **High Threshold for Conditional Cooperation:** It requires a significant observed benefit from group cooperation (average opponent payoff > 1.2x own payoff) before even considering cooperating. It's not easily swayed by minor gains.
*   **Decisive Punishment:** If cooperation is initiated and not met with sufficient reciprocation (fewer than n/2 cooperators), it immediately and permanently reverts to defection for the rest of the game (unless a very specific late-game catch-up is triggered). There's no gradual reduction of defection.
*   **Exploitation of Stable Cooperation:** If others consistently cooperate, and your defection is yielding a higher payoff, the strategy continues to defect, maximizing personal gain.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Once trust is broken (i.e., cooperation is not reciprocated sufficiently), the strategy does not attempt to rebuild it. Defection becomes the default.
*   **Late-Game Aggression:** The strategy prioritizes individual gain in the final rounds, ensuring no opportunities for others to exploit a lingering cooperative sentiment.

    // To get average opponent payoff, we need to sum their payoffs and divide by (n-1).
    // This is tricky without individual opponent actions.
    // A simpler proxy for strategic intent: if 'total_cooperators' is high, it implies higher group benefit.
    // Let's assume the trigger logic in the main function is sufficient given this limited info.
    // For the trigger to be meaningful, it implies we are comparing *our* payoff from defecting (which is 1 if we defect)
    // against what we *would* get if we were part of the cooperators and the group was generally cooperating.

    // A pragmatic approach given the constraint: if the *total payoff generated by the group* is high,
    // and our payoff is relatively low (because we defected), then the average opponent payoff is likely higher.
    // Let's re-evaluate the trigger from the perspective of *our own* potential gain.

    // Revised interpretation for trigger:
    // If the total payoff from cooperation (k/n * total_cooperators) is high, and our payoff is not,
    // it means others are benefiting more from the group.
    
    // If I defected (my_ci = 0), my payoff is 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators.
    // If I cooperated (my_ci = 1), my payoff is 0 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators + 1).

    // The trigger is: "average payoff of all players (excluding oneself) is greater than 1.2 times your own payoff"
    // Let P_i be player i's payoff. We observe P_my. We want to compare it to avg(P_j for j!=i).
    // avg(P_j for j!=i) = (Sum(P_j for all j) - P_my) / (n-1)
    // This is hard to calculate without full history of others.

    // Let's simplify the trigger concept:
    // If playing D, my payoff is 1. If total cooperators are high, the common good contribution (k/n * total_cooperators) is large.
    // The trigger should capture when the *potential gain from cooperation* is high, and we are not fully realizing it.
    // If total_cooperators > n/2, it suggests a generally cooperative environment.
    // If playing D, my payoff is 1. The average payoff for cooperators is 0 + (k/n) * total_cooperators.
    // If this average payoff for cooperators is substantially higher than 1, it's a sign.

    // Let's focus on the "total contribution to the public good" as a proxy for group benefit.
    total_public_good_generated = (k/n) * total_cooperators
    
    // If I defected, my payoff is 1. If total_public_good_generated is large, others get their 1 (if they defect)
    // PLUS the share of the public good.
    // The trigger is essentially asking: "Am I leaving a lot of money on the table by defecting?"
    // If total_cooperators are high, the *overall* pie is larger. If I defect, I get a slice of the pie plus my endowment.
    // If I cooperated, I only get my share of the pie.

    // A simplified interpretation of the trigger "average payoff of all players (excluding oneself) is greater than 1.2 times your own payoff":
    // If I defected, my payoff is 1. The average payoff of others will be higher if the common good is large.
    // Let's define `benefit_from_cooperation` as (k/n) * total_cooperators.
    // If I defected, my payoff is 1.
    // If I cooperated, my payoff is benefit_from_cooperation.
    // The trigger implies that the "system" is producing more than 1.2 times my current payoff.
    // If I'm defecting (payoff 1), and the system is generating substantial benefit for cooperators.

    // For the purpose of implementing the trigger, let's use a simpler interpretation:
    // If the *total number of cooperators* in the previous round is significantly high (e.g., > n/2),
    // AND my own payoff in that round was relatively low (because I defected and didn't fully benefit from their cooperation),
    // THEN consider cooperating.

    if my_action == "D":
        my_payoff_this_round = 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators
    else: // my_action == "C"
        my_payoff_this_round = (k/n) * (total_cooperators + 1) // Assuming I was one of the cooperators

    // This approximation is still difficult without knowing opponent actions.
    // The simplest and most direct interpretation of the prompt's trigger:
    // "average payoff of all players (excluding oneself) is greater than 1.2 times your own payoff"
    // This requires knowledge of *other* players' payoffs. Since we don't have that, we need a proxy.
    // The best proxy for a generally beneficial cooperative environment is a high number of cooperators.
    // Let's adjust the trigger to be based on observed 'total_cooperators' and 'my_payoff'.

    // REVISED TRIGGER LOGIC:
    // In the initial phase, if I defected, my payoff is 1.
    // If the number of cooperators in the previous round (cooperators_prev_round) was high (e.g., > n/2),
    // it implies that if I *had* cooperated, I *might* have received a higher payoff.
    // The strategy is to test cooperation IF there is evidence of a strong cooperative signal from the group,
    // AND my current defection isn't fully capitalizing on it.
    // The 1.2x factor is tricky. Let's simplify the trigger in pseudocode to:
    // IF cooperators_prev_round > n/2 AND my_payoff_history[current_round - 1] < 1.5 (meaning I got close to baseline by defecting, but system could do better)

    // For simplicity in pseudocode, and to make it runnable without complex inference:
    // The trigger can be based on the *number of cooperators* and *my current payoff*.
    // If I defected, my payoff is 1. If the system is generating more than 1.2 * 1 = 1.2 on average for others,
    // then I should consider cooperating. This happens when k/n * total_cooperators is high.

    // Let's assume 'average_opponent_payoff_prev_round' can be estimated as:
    // If I defected, my payoff is 1. The total public good contribution is (k/n) * total_cooperators.
    // The total payoff for all players is SUM(1-ci) + (k/n) * SUM(cj) = n - SUM(cj) + (k/n) * SUM(cj)
    // Average payoff for all = (n - SUM(cj) + (k/n) * SUM(cj)) / n
    // If I defected, my payoff is 1.
    // If I cooperated, my payoff is (k/n) * (total_cooperators + 1).

    // The original trigger wording is strong: "average payoff of all players (excluding oneself)".
    // This necessitates knowing others' actions.
    // A practical heuristic for this strategy, given the "aggressive" constraint and lack of explicit opponent payoff tracking:
    // If 'total_cooperators' in the previous round was high (e.g., > n/2), and my payoff was close to the minimum (1),
    // it's a sign that the collective effort yielded more, and I might benefit more from joining.

    // Let's use a simplified proxy for the trigger:
    if round_index > 0:
        cooperators_prev_round = group_cooperators_history[round_index]
        my_payoff_prev_round = my_payoffs_history[round_index]
        
        // If total cooperators are significantly high AND my payoff is not exceeding it by much (suggesting I am not exploiting enough)
        if cooperators_prev_round > n / 2 and my_payoff_prev_round < 1.5: // A heuristic for "average opponent payoff > 1.2 * my payoff"

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff in a competitive tournament setting where you cannot rely on cooperation from others.

## Aggressive "Opportunistic Defection" Strategy

This strategy is built on the principle of **always defecting unless there is a clear and immediate benefit to cooperating that outweighs the risk.** It aims to extract maximum private gain while being prepared to exploit any perceived weakness or shift in opponent behavior.

**Core Philosophy:** Assume everyone else is trying to exploit you. Only cooperate when it directly benefits you in that round, or when a short period of cooperation is necessary to set up a larger future gain that you can then exploit.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The fundamental decision rule is to **Defect (D) by default.** Cooperation (C) is a rare exception.

*   **Primary Rule: Defect (D)**
    *   In any given round, your initial inclination is to play 'D'. This secures your endowment and allows you to benefit from others' contributions without incurring the cost.

*   **Conditional Cooperation (C): The "Exploitation Setup" Tactic**
    *   You will only consider cooperating if a specific condition is met:
        *   **Condition:** If, in the *previous* round, you played 'D' and observed that the *average payoff* among all players (including yourself) was *less than the payoff you would have received if everyone had cooperated*.
        *   **Rationale:** This condition signals that the collective outcome was suboptimal, implying a lack of widespread cooperation. By defecting in the current round, you are taking advantage of this situation. You might *consider* a single round of cooperation *only* if you believe it can *significantly* increase the total contributions in the current round, leading to a higher (k/n) * total_contributions value that more than offsets your endowment cost.
        *   **Crucial Caveat:** This conditional cooperation is **extremely rare** and short-lived. It's not about building trust; it's about creating a brief window where a high total contribution benefits you, setting up subsequent rounds for even greater defection.
        *   **"Aggressive Twist":** You will *only* cooperate if you can calculate that your single act of cooperation, combined with the *expected* defections of others, still results in a *higher* payoff for *you* in the current round than if you had defected.

**Simplified Decision Logic for Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

1.  **Calculate your potential payoff if you play D:** `π_i,t(D) = 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_in_round_t-1)` (where `total_cooperators_in_round_t-1` is the count from the *previous* round).
2.  **Calculate your potential payoff if you play C:** `π_i,t(C) = 0 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_in_round_t-1 + 1)`.
3.  **Compare:**
    *   If `π_i,t(D) >= π_i,t(C)`: **Play D**. You gain more or equal by defecting.
    *   If `π_i,t(D) < π_i,t(C)`: **This is where the "Opportunistic Setup" kicks in.** You *might* consider playing C.
        *   **Aggressive Refinement:** You will *only* play C if this choice (playing C) leads to a higher payoff for *you* in round `t` compared to your default choice of playing D.
        *   So, if `π_i,t(C) > π_i,t(D)`: **Play C**. (This is the rare cooperative move).
        *   Otherwise: **Play D**.

**This means you are essentially always playing 'D', unless you can demonstrably prove that playing 'C' in the current round will result in a higher payoff *for you* in *that very round*, given the observed behavior of others in the previous round.**

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (The Initial Move):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** There is no history to analyze. In a new environment, the safest and most aggressive initial move is to secure your endowment. You have no basis to assume cooperation will benefit you, and 'D' guarantees you at least 1 unit. This sets a precedent of not being a pushover.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence or exploit. The incentive for any player to cooperate disappears. You want to maximize your payoff in this final opportunity. There is no long-term consequence to defecting.

*   **When `k/n` is very small (close to 1):**
    *   The contribution to the public good from cooperation is minimal. Defection becomes even more attractive.
    *   **Decision:** You will almost always **Defect (D)**. The small marginal gain from cooperation is unlikely to outweigh the guaranteed gain from defection, especially given the risk of others also defecting.

*   **When `k/n` is very large (close to `n`):**
    *   Cooperation becomes more appealing because the total contribution has a larger impact.
    *   **Decision:** You will still prioritize **Defecting (D)**. However, the condition for potential cooperation (`π_i,t(C) > π_i,t(D)`) becomes slightly more likely to be met. You will still only cooperate if it directly benefits *you* in that round, based on the calculation. You are not building trust; you are opportunistically participating in a high-payout round if the math dictates *you* are better off with a C, even if it's just for one round.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset

*   **"Exploiter of the Weak":** This strategy assumes other players might be naive, altruistic, or trying to coordinate. You will exploit any such tendencies ruthlessly.
*   **"No Forgiveness, Only Gain":** You don't care about building long-term cooperative relationships. Your only goal is maximizing your *own* absolute payoff, round by round, with an eye on setting up future exploitation.
*   **"The Last Laugh":** By defecting consistently, you force others to defect or suffer losses. If others manage to sustain cooperation among themselves, you will be the sole beneficiary of their endowments.
*   **"Adaptation is Exploitation":** Your "adaptation" is not about fostering cooperation, but about identifying when the current game state presents a unique opportunity for personal gain, even if it means a single, calculated act of cooperation.

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for a tournament setting. This strategy prioritizes extracting maximum personal gain while being resilient to various opponent behaviors.

## Aggressive "Exploit and Deter" Strategy

This strategy is built on the principle of **opportunistic exploitation** and **deterrence through punishment**. The core idea is to leverage periods of cooperation by others to our advantage, but to quickly retaliate against defectors to prevent being exploited.

### 1. Decision Rules

**The primary driver of our decision is the behavior of the group in the previous round.**

*   **Cooperate (C) if:**
    *   **The previous round had a high proportion of cooperators.** Specifically, if the total number of cooperators in the previous round ($n_{C, t-1}$) was **greater than or equal to `n/2`**. This signifies a healthy level of cooperation, and we want to encourage this to maximize our collective payoff, while still benefiting from the shared gains.
    *   **It's the very first round (t=1) AND `k/n` is significantly above 1 (i.e., `k/n > 1`).** This is a very weak initial cooperation signal. We'll defect in the first round unless the parameters *strongly* favor cooperation from the outset. *Correction*: For true aggression, we will always defect on round 1.

*   **Defect (D) if:**
    *   **The previous round had a low proportion of cooperators.** Specifically, if the total number of cooperators in the previous round ($n_{C, t-1}$) was **less than `n/2`**. This indicates that the group is not cooperating enough to make our cooperation individually beneficial, and we need to protect our endowment.
    *   **It's the very first round (t=1).** We start by defecting to establish a position of strength and observe others' initial tendencies.
    *   **We have been "punished" by the group (i.e., they defected against us).** If in the previous round, more than `n/2` players defected against us (meaning, we played C and they played D), we will immediately switch to Defect for the current round. This is a direct response to perceived exploitation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** **Always Defect (D).** This is crucial for an aggressive strategy. We want to see what others do without exposing our endowment. It also sets a precedent that we are not a guaranteed cooperator.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** **Always Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future consequences to consider. The rational decision in a finitely repeated game's last round is to defect to maximize immediate individual gain. This is the ultimate expression of our aggressive stance.
*   **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):** The decision rules outlined above apply. We dynamically adjust based on the group's behavior.

### 3. Aggressive Philosophy

*   **"Exploit the Cooperators":** When others are cooperating, especially when more than half the group is cooperating, we gain more by cooperating ourselves. Our share of the public good is `(k/n) * n_C`. If we defect, our payoff is 1. If we cooperate, our payoff is `(1-1) + (k/n) * n_C = (k/n) * n_C`. We cooperate if `(k/n) * n_C > 1`. With `k/n < 1`, this requires `n_C > n / (k/n) = n^2/k`. Since `k < n`, `n^2/k > n`. This means that even with all players cooperating, our payoff is 2. So, our rule of cooperating when `n_C >= n/2` is designed to capture the benefits of significant cooperation, but only when it demonstrably benefits us. However, the *aggressive* twist is that we only need *some* cooperation to potentially benefit. The `n/2` threshold is a robust heuristic.

*   **"Punish the Defectors Swiftly":** If the group's cooperation level drops below `n/2`, we immediately defect. This signals that we will not be a "sucker" and will protect our endowment. This also serves as a deterrent. If others know we will defect when they defect, they might be more inclined to cooperate.

*   **"No Free Lunch":** We will never initiate cooperation unless parameters *strongly* dictate it (which they don't, given `k < n` always makes defecting individually rational in a single round). Our initial move is defensive and observational.

**Key Aggressive Aspects:**

*   **Always Defect on Round 1:** This immediately signals a non-cooperative stance and forces others to react to our moves.
*   **Always Defect on Last Round:** Maximizes immediate gain in the absence of future repercussions.
*   **Threshold for Cooperation:** We only cooperate when a substantial majority of players (at least half) are already cooperating. This ensures we are entering a state where our cooperation is most likely to be individually beneficial and not lead to our exploitation. We are not leading the cooperation, but rather joining it when it's profitable and stable.
*   **Lack of Forgiveness:** The strategy doesn't have explicit forgiveness mechanisms. If cooperation dips, we defect. If it recovers, we might re-evaluate, but the primary mode is self-protection.

This strategy is robust because it doesn't rely on specific predictable patterns from opponents. It reacts to aggregate behavior and prioritizes self-interest, making it a formidable opponent in a tournament setting.

description_AGGRESSIVE_38 = '''
This is an interesting challenge! Designing an aggressive, adaptive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game requires a careful balance between exploiting opportunities for higher individual payoff and mitigating the risk of being exploited by others. The key is to be proactive and assertive, while also being able to react effectively to the prevailing environment.

Here's an aggressive strategy I'll call "Aggressive Exploiter with Contingency":

**Core Philosophy: Maximize individual gain, exploit cooperation, punish defection when it hurts, and adapt to the game's dynamics.**

This strategy is driven by the understanding that while cooperation can lead to higher *collective* payoffs, the structure of the game favors defection for individual gain, especially when $k < n$. The "Aggressive Exploiter with Contingency" aims to leverage this inherent incentive while being prepared for situations where collective benefit might be necessary or where sustained defection is being punished by others.

---

## 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The strategy's decision making is primarily based on the observed behavior of other players and the game's current state. It prioritizes defection unless there's a compelling reason to cooperate for a greater individual gain.

**Rule 1: Default to Defection (when in doubt, defect).**
*   **Condition:** In any given round, if no specific condition triggers cooperation, the strategy will play **D**. This is the most aggressive stance, ensuring personal endowment protection.

**Rule 2: Cooperate to Trigger High Collective Payoff (strategic cooperation).**
*   **Condition:** If the *previous round* (or a recent history window) saw a high proportion of cooperators (e.g., > n/2), and playing C in the current round would lead to a higher individual payoff than playing D given that proportion of cooperators.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Let $N_C$ be the number of cooperators in the previous round.
    *   If playing D: $\pi_i(D) = 1 + (k/n) \times N_C$
    *   If playing C: $\pi_i(C) = 0 + (k/n) \times (N_C + 1)$
    *   **Decision:** Play C if $\pi_i(C) > \pi_i(D)$ AND the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was sufficiently high to suggest a potential for a significant collective boost (this threshold can be tuned, but let's start with $N_C > n/2$). This aims to jump-start or sustain a beneficial cooperative environment *if* it's already somewhat established.

**Rule 3: Punish Aggressively (retaliation).**
*   **Condition:** If in the *immediately preceding round*, the total payoff for this player was significantly lower than the maximum possible payoff they could have achieved by defecting. This indicates they were likely exploited by a high number of cooperators that round.
*   **Decision:** Play **D** for a determined number of subsequent rounds (e.g., 1 or 2 rounds). This is a strong deterrent. The duration of punishment can be a parameter.

**Rule 4: Adapt to Sustained Defection (reciprocity when defection is dominant).**
*   **Condition:** If a significant majority of players (e.g., > n/2) have been playing D for the last few rounds (e.g., 3 consecutive rounds).
*   **Decision:** While the default is D, this condition indicates a "cooperative failure" or a highly defecting environment. In this scenario, it's often still best to defect to avoid being the sole cooperator. However, to *maintain potential for future gains*, if a strong signal of defection is observed, the strategy *might* consider cooperating *if* it can guarantee a higher payoff than everyone else defecting. This is a nuanced defensive cooperation.
    *   If everyone else defects (n-1 players play D), your payoff for playing D is 1. Your payoff for playing C is $(k/n)$. Since $k < n$, $(k/n) < 1$. So, in an all-D world, defecting is always better. This rule essentially acknowledges that pure defection is the Nash Equilibrium in a single round, but in a repeated game, signals of extreme defection might necessitate a slight adjustment if the payoff difference is minimal and future gains are prioritized. *However, given the aggressive stance, this rule might be simplified: if a majority are defecting, keep defecting to avoid being the sucker.* Let's stick to the aggressive interpretation: *If a majority defects, always defect.*

**Rule 5: Opportunistic Cooperation (when an individual boost is guaranteed).**
*   **Condition:** If in the previous round, a very high proportion of players cooperated ($N_C = n-1$), and playing C in the current round would result in a payoff greater than 1 (your baseline payoff from defecting if everyone else defects).
*   **Calculation:**
    *   If playing C: $\pi_i(C) = 0 + (k/n) \times n = k$.
    *   If playing D: $\pi_i(D) = 1 + (k/n) \times (n-1)$.
    *   **Decision:** Play C if $k > 1 + (k/n) \times (n-1)$. This inequality simplifies to $k/n > 1$, which contradicts the game parameter ($k < n$). *Therefore, this rule as stated is never triggered.*

    *   **Revised Rule 5 (more aggressive and realistic):** Cooperate *only* if you can gain more by cooperating than by defecting *in the current round*, *even if everyone else defects*.
        *   If you play C, your payoff is $(k/n)$.
        *   If you play D, your payoff is 1.
        *   **Decision:** Cooperate IF $(k/n) > 1$. This is impossible given $k < n$.
        *   **Therefore, the aggressive interpretation is: Never cooperate solely for an individual boost in a situation where others are likely defecting, because the payoff from defection is always higher or equal when $k < n$.**

**Summary of Decision Logic (Simplified & Aggressive):**

1.  **Default:** Play **D**.
2.  **Retaliate:** If my payoff last round was significantly lower than the max possible (i.e., I was exploited), play **D** for X rounds.
3.  **Exploit Opportunity:** If the majority of players cooperated last round ($N_C > n/2$) AND playing C this round would yield a higher payoff for me than playing D *given that majority cooperation*, then play **C**. (This is a rare, temporary cooperation to maximize gain in a positive environment).
4.  **If neither of the above triggers cooperation, play D.**

---

## 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** Play **D**. There is no history to analyze, no prior exploitation to retaliate against, and no established cooperative norm. The most aggressive and risk-averse strategy is to secure your initial endowment.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** Play **D**. In the final round, there are no future consequences. The incentive to cooperate vanishes, and the incentive to defect to maximize the absolute final payoff becomes paramount. This is the standard "end-game" defection behavior.

*   **Rounds Before the Last (t = r-1):**
    *   **Decision:** This round is crucial. The strategy will apply its standard decision rules. It will cooperate only if Rule 3 (Exploit Opportunity) triggers. It will also be keenly aware of the impending last round and may start leaning more towards defection if previous rounds haven't shown consistent cooperation.

*   **Few Players (n is small):**
    *   The strategy should adapt naturally. The thresholds for "majority" and the impact of $(k/n)$ will be more pronounced. For example, if $n=2$, $k=1.5$:
        *   All D: Payoff 1.
        *   All C: Payoff 1.5.
        *   Player 1 C, Player 2 D: P1 gets $(1.5/2) = 0.75$, P2 gets 1.
        *   Player 1 D, Player 2 C: P1 gets 1, P2 gets 0.75.
    *   In this $n=2, k=1.5$ scenario, defection is still individually rational if the other player defects (payoff 1 vs 0.75). Cooperation is only better if *both* cooperate (1.5 vs 1). The strategy will prioritize D, and only consider C if the other player is already cooperating (Rule 3, adjusted for small N).

*   **High Multiplication Factor (k close to n):**
    *   As k approaches n, the shared benefit of cooperation increases. However, the strategy remains aggressive. It will still default to D, but the "Exploit Opportunity" rule (Rule 3) becomes more likely to trigger if others are cooperating, as the payoff difference between C and D becomes smaller or even favors C under certain cooperative conditions (though mathematically, with $k<n$, defecting is usually better when others cooperate). The core aggressive principle of self-interest overrides the potential for higher collective good unless individual gain is *directly* and *safely* increased by temporary cooperation.

---

## 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **Default Defection:** This is the bedrock of aggression. Always assume others will try to take advantage, so protect yourself first.
*   **Retaliation:** "Don't mess with me." If you get exploited, you get punished. This is not about fairness; it's about deterring future attempts.
*   **Opportunistic Exploitation:** "If you're being nice, I'll take it." The strategy *will* cooperate, but *only* when it demonstrably increases its own payoff, usually by piggybacking on existing cooperation to amplify gains. This is not altruism; it's calculated self-interest.
*   **No Forgiveness (initially):** The punishment phase is designed to be a strong signal. The strategy is not looking to build long-term trust based on sentiment, but on predictable self-interest and deterrence.
*   **Adaptation, not Passivity:** The strategy is not a static defector. It reacts to the environment. If a highly cooperative environment emerges that benefits the strategy *individually*, it will participate briefly to maximize gains before reverting to its default aggressive stance.

            // So, this rule needs a more pragmatic interpretation: cooperate if it *slightly* increases my payoff

            // For *aggressive* strategy, this should be very rare. Let's make it:

            // I should play C IF (k/n)*(N_C + 1) > 1 + (k/n)*N_C for MYSELF.
            // This inequality simplifies to k/n > 1, which is NOT possible.
            // Therefore, the *only* way this rule can trigger is if the calculation is based on a slightly different premise.

            // Let's re-read the problem: "Aggressive strategy that only depends on the game parameters and history."
            // And the goal: "Maximize individual gain, exploit cooperation, punish defection."
            // The most aggressive interpretation of "exploit cooperation" is: IF others are cooperating to a degree
            // that my payoff from COOPERATING is higher than defecting, THEN cooperate.
            // If k/n > 1, then it would be:
            // Cooperate if k/n * (N_C + 1) > 1 + k/n * N_C
            //  => k/n * N_C + k/n > 1 + k/n * N_C
            //  => k/n > 1. This is not allowed.

            // The only scenario where C can give more than D is if the endowment is taken away (0 vs 1)
            // AND the share from public good is sufficiently large.
            // (k/n)*(N_C+1) > 1 + (k/n)*N_C
            // This implies that the condition for "Exploit Opportunity" as originally stated
            // will NEVER be met under the game parameters.

            // This means, to be aggressive, we should NOT cooperate on this basis.
            // The strategy should be: IF my payoff from defecting is WORSE than it could be, THEN I might cooperate.
            // But the prompt asks for an AGGRESSIVE strategy.
            // The most aggressive way to interpret "exploit cooperation" without violating k<n is:
            // If a LOT of people are cooperating, THEN I'll defect because the public good is high anyway,
            // and I get the endowment PLUS a share.
            // But the rule says "cooperate if it benefits me". It demonstrably doesn't in this strict case.

            // *** New interpretation of Rule 2 (Aggressive Exploitation): ***
            // Cooperate IF the total payoff from cooperating is higher than the total payoff from defecting,
            // *given the current level of cooperation.*
            // This logic only makes sense IF k/n > 1, which is not the case.
            // Thus, my best response is ALWAYS to defect if others cooperate.

            // Let's consider the structure of the payoff: pi_i = (1 - c_i) + (k/n) * SUM(cj).
            // If player i defects (c_i=0), pi_i = 1 + (k/n)*N_C.
            // If player i cooperates (c_i=1), pi_i = 0 + (k/n)*(N_C+1).
            // Player i prefers to defect IF 1 + (k/n)*N_C > (k/n)*(N_C+1)
            // 1 + (k/n)*N_C > (k/n)*N_C + k/n
            // 1 > k/n. This is ALWAYS true given k < n.
            // THEREFORE, for any given number of cooperators (N_C), defecting is ALWAYS individually rational.

            // This implies that my "Exploit Opportunity" rule MUST be interpreted differently for an aggressive strategy.
            // "Exploit opportunity" for an aggressive player means:
            // If cooperation is UNSUSTAINABLE or leads to punishment, I don't engage.
            // If cooperation is HIGHLY BENEFICIAL FOR ME *personally*, I might *temporarily* join.
            // The only way cooperation can benefit me personally MORE than defecting is if k/n > 1.
            // Since k/n < 1, this rule can NEVER trigger cooperation based on individual payoff maximization.

            // *** Final Decision on Rule 2: Aggressive Interpretation ***
            // Aggressive Exploiter will NEVER cooperate based on direct individual payoff comparison IF k < n.
            // Therefore, the "Exploit Opportunity" rule as described in standard PGG literature
            // which relies on the benefit of "going from 1 to k" must be re-interpreted.
            //
            // The *only* reason to cooperate for this strategy, if it *ever* does, is if
            // cooperating somehow PREVENTS a worse outcome for me, OR leads to a higher payoff in a very specific scenario.
            // The prompt states "aggressive strategy that only depends on the game parameters and history".

            // Let's assume "Exploit Opportunity" means: if the environment is VERY cooperative,
            // and defecting leads to a payoff that is NOT significantly better than cooperating
            // (even if slightly worse), THEN I might play C to signal, IF it avoids a collective breakdown.
            // But this is NOT aggressive.

            // The most aggressive interpretation: Cooperation only matters if k/n > 1. Since it is not,
            // this strategy WILL defect in this scenario. The rule should be:
            // IF the proportion of cooperators last round was HIGH (> COOPERATION_THRESHOLD) AND
            // my payoff last round was GOOD (not exploited), THEN I *might* consider cooperating
            // IF the individual gain is positive and there's a chance to keep the good dynamic going.
            // BUT, since 1 > k/n, defecting is ALWAYS better.
            // So, this rule as stated will never trigger C.

            // *** FINAL REVISED DECISION LOGIC ***

            // Rule 1: Default to Defect (always, unless specific conditions met)
            // Rule 2: Punish Exploitation (if my payoff < 1 last round, defect for X rounds)
            // Rule 3: Observe Majority Defection (if > n/2 players defected for N rounds, keep defecting)

            // Let's implement a simpler, more aggressive logic derived from the game structure.
            // Aggressive Exploiter ALWAYS defects unless there's a very specific, safe, and beneficial reason.
            // Since k<n, cooperation is NEVER individually better than defecting in a single round, regardless of others' actions.
            // This means the strategy will NEVER cooperate IF k<n, UNLESS it's a transient, very short-term "cooperation"
            // that is immediately punished by the player themselves.

            // Let's refine the rules based on the inherent incentive structure:
            // Player i prefers D if: 1 + (k/n) * N_C > (k/n) * (N_C + 1)  => 1 > k/n (always true)
            // This means player i ALWAYS prefers D for any N_C.
            // So an AGGRESSIVE strategy would ALWAYS defect. BUT the prompt implies adaptiveness and robustness.

            // Adaptive Aggression:
            // If everyone else defects, my payoff is 1 by defecting. By cooperating, my payoff is k/n < 1. So I defect.
            // If some people cooperate, say N_C.
            //  My payoff D: 1 + (k/n) * N_C
            //  My payoff C: 0 + (k/n) * (N_C + 1)
            // Still, 1 + (k/n) * N_C > (k/n) * N_C + k/n => 1 > k/n.
            // So, defecting is ALWAYS better.

            // This is a bit counter-intuitive for an *adaptive* strategy.
            // The only way to be adaptive and aggressive is to exploit "mistakes" or unusual patterns.

            // Let's consider what a "cooperative" environment means for an aggressive player:
            // It means others are foregoing their endowment (playing C).
            // This increases SUM(cj).
            // My payoff from D is 1 + (k/n) * N_C.
            // My payoff from C is (k/n) * (N_C + 1).

            // *** The Aggressive Exploiter Strategy ***
            // 1. Default: Defect.
            // 2. Retaliation: If my payoff last round was < 1, I was exploited. Defect for X rounds.
            // 3. Opportunism: If a majority of players are defecting for the last M rounds, CONTINUE defecting.
            //    (This is defensive aggression - don't be the lone cooperator in a defection fest.)
            // 4. The only "cooperation" will be temporary and strategically timed if it maximizes payoff in a specific, short-term window.

            // Let's re-frame Rule 2: "Exploit Opportunity"
            // This rule must address the case where cooperating *might* lead to a good outcome,
            // even if it's not strictly better in the immediate payoff calculation.
            // It's about navigating towards higher payoffs.

            // New Rule 2 (Aggressive but Adaptive):
            // Cooperate IF:
            //   a) The average payoff of *all players* in the previous round was high (suggesting a beneficial environment).
            //   b) AND, if I were to cooperate, my payoff would be *close* to my payoff from defecting (i.e., the difference is small).
            //   c) AND, my own payoff from defecting last round was good (I wasn't exploited).
            // This is not perfect, as k/n < 1 means defect is always better.
            // This rule needs to be based on observed collective outcomes.

            // **Simplest Aggressive Adaptive Strategy:**
            // - Defect in round 1 and round r.
            // - If I was exploited last round (payoff < 1), defect for X rounds.
            // - Otherwise, defect.
            // This is pure Grim Trigger but only punishes own exploitation.

            // The prompt states: "robust to a wide range of opponent behaviours."
            // This requires reacting to the environment.

            // *** Revised Strategy: The "Opportunistic Defector" ***

            // 1. **First & Last Round:** Defect.
            // 2. **Default Behavior:** Defect.
            // 3. **Punishment:** If player i's payoff in the previous round was less than 1 (i.e., less than their endowment), play 'D' for PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS.
            // 4. **Conditional Cooperation (Rare):** If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round was very high (e.g., > 0.8 * n) AND my payoff last round was >= 1 (i.e., I wasn't exploited by this cooperation), THEN play 'C'. This is an opportunistic move to benefit from a strong positive externality when it's "safe" and individually beneficial (even if slightly).
            //    *This condition is tricky. If N_C is high, my payoff from D is 1 + (k/n)*N_C. My payoff from C is (k/n)*(N_C+1).
            //    As shown, 1 > k/n, so defecting is always better.
            //    This implies the "conditional cooperation" MUST be framed differently for an aggressive player.
            //    It's about *minimizing losses* or *maximizing gains relative to potential defection*.

            // *** Final Strategy for this prompt (Aggressive, Adaptive, Robust): ***

            // The core of aggression is self-interest. Since k < n, pure defection is always the best response to any given state of the world in a single round.
            // Therefore, an aggressive strategy should mostly defect. However, "adaptive" and "robust" imply reacting.

            // **1. Default Action:** Play **D**.

            // **2. Round 1 & Last Round:**
            //    - Round 1: Play **D**. No history.
            //    - Round r: Play **D**. No future.

            // **3. Retaliation Mechanism:**
            //    - If my payoff in the previous round was less than 1 (i.e., I was exploited), play **D** for `PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS`.
            //    - Keep track of `consecutive_defections_by_me`. If it's less than `PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS`, return 'D'.
            //    - If `consecutive_defections_by_me` reaches `PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS`, reset it and proceed.

            // **4. Opportunistic Cooperation (Aggressive Interpretation):**
            //    - This is the most nuanced part for an aggressive player. Since defecting is always better,
            //      cooperation can *only* be a tool to influence future rounds or to "ride the wave" of others' cooperation when it's safe.
            //    - **Condition:** If the previous round had a very high proportion of cooperators (e.g., $> n * 0.7$) AND my payoff last round was >= 1 (meaning I didn't suffer by others cooperating).
            //    - **Decision:** Play 'C' *if and only if* my payoff from cooperating would be *within a small tolerance* of my payoff from defecting, AND cooperating might secure benefits in subsequent rounds by encouraging others. This is a calculated gamble.
            //    - Let's use a simplified condition: Play 'C' if previous round cooperators > 0.8*n AND my payoff last round was >= 1.
            //      This strategy *bets* that by contributing when others do, it can maintain a potentially higher payoff environment for future rounds, even if the current round's payoff from C is technically less than D. This is the *only* instance of cooperation.

            // **5. Default Action (Fallback):**
            //    - If none of the above conditions trigger cooperation, play **D**.

            // This strategy is aggressive because it defaults to defection, punishes exploitation, and only "cooperates" under very specific conditions that maximize its current or perceived future benefit, or are a calculated signal.

            // --- Re-evaluating the payoff calculation and rule application for Aggressive Exploiter ---
            // Payoff for player i in round t: pi_i,t = (1 - c_i,t) + (k/n) * SUM(c_j,t)
            // c_i = 1 if C, 0 if D.
            // Let N_C be the number of cooperators in round t.
            // If player i plays D (c_i = 0): pi_i,t = 1 + (k/n) * N_C
            // If player i plays C (c_i = 1): pi_i,t = 0 + (k/n) * (N_C + 1)

            // player i prefers D if: 1 + (k/n) * N_C > (k/n) * (N_C + 1)
            // 1 + (k/n) * N_C > (k/n) * N_C + k/n
            // 1 > k/n
            // Since k < n, this is always true. Defecting is ALWAYS strictly better for an individual player, regardless of how many others cooperate.

            // This means, for an AGGRESSIVE strategy, there is NO condition under which playing C is STRICTLY better for that player than playing D.
            // Therefore, an aggressive strategy should ONLY play D.
            // HOWEVER, the prompt asks for "adaptive and robust." This implies it should react.

            // The ONLY way an aggressive player would EVER cooperate is if it's to ENSURE a better outcome for itself in the LONG RUN.
            // This is subtle. It means cooperating NOW might yield LESS than defecting NOW, but could lead to a future state where the player gets MORE.

            // **Strategy Revision: The Pure Defector with Contingent Retaliation**

            // This strategy is designed to be maximally aggressive and robust by sticking to the dominant strategy but retaliating against exploitation.

            // **1. First Round:**
            //    - Action: **D**
            //    - Reason: No history, secure endowment.

            // **2. Last Round:**
            //    - Action: **D**
            //    - Reason: No future consequences, maximize final payoff.

            // **3. Middle Rounds (t < r):**
            //    - **Default Action:** **D**
            //    - **Retaliation Trigger:** If my payoff in the previous round (`my_past_payoffs[round_number - 1]`) was less than 1 (my endowment).
            //    - **Retaliation Action:** If the retaliation trigger is active, play **D**. Continue playing **D** for `PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS` following the round of exploitation.
            //      - This requires tracking `consecutive_defections_by_me`.

            // **4. If not in retaliation mode and not round 1/last:**
            //    - Action: **D**

            // This strategy is pure defection except for a self-imposed punishment phase after being exploited.
            // It is aggressive because it always prioritizes individual gain.
            // It is adaptive because it reacts to exploitation.
            // It is robust because it doesn't rely on others cooperating, and punishes them if they exploit its cooperative moments (if any were ever to occur, which they don't in this strategy).

            // Let's make the "contingent" part about *who* I'm retaliating against if I could track individual contributions, but since I can't, it's against the general state.

            // *** Final Final Strategy: The "Aggressive Reciprocator of Exploitation" ***

            // **Core Principle:** Maximize own payoff. Defection is always best in a single round. React aggressively to being exploited.

            // **Parameters:**
            // `PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS = 2` (How many rounds to defect after being exploited)

            // **State Variables:**
            // `punishment_counter = 0` (Number of consecutive rounds player is currently defecting due to exploitation)

            // **Decision Logic:**

            // `function decide_action(round_number, n, r, k, history)`:

            //     `my_past_payoffs = history.get_my_payoffs()`
            //     `my_last_payoff = my_past_payoffs[round_number - 1]` // Assuming 0-indexed history for round t-1

            //     // --- Handle Edge Cases ---
            //     if `round_number == 1`:
            //         `punishment_counter = 0` // Reset counter
            //         return 'D'

            //     if `round_number == r`:
            //         return 'D' // Last round, always defect

            //     // --- Dynamic Decision Making ---

            //     // Check if currently in a punishment phase
            //     if `punishment_counter > 0`:
            //         `punishment_counter -= 1` // Decrement counter
            //         return 'D' // Continue defecting

            //     // Check if player was exploited in the last round
            //     if `my_last_payoff < 1`: // Payoff less than endowment means exploitation
            //         `punishment_counter = PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS` // Activate punishment phase
            //         return 'D' // Defect immediately and start punishment countdown

            //     // Default action if not punishing and not exploited
            //     return 'D'

            // This strategy is maximally aggressive, as it always defects unless a specific (and rare) event of exploitation has occurred, triggering a temporary, but deliberate, period of punishment. It is robust because it does not rely on cooperation and actively punishes those who might try to exploit it.
            // It is adaptive in that it reacts to being exploited, which is a key aspect of "robustness".
            // It will win against strategies that are too trusting or too easily exploited.
            // It will not win against a perfectly coordinated strategy that exploits the end-game, but this is a tournament setting, and pure defection is generally a strong baseline.

            // This strategy adheres to the aggressive mindset: "I will always take my endowment. If you try to make me get less than my endowment by cooperating a lot, I will punish you for it."
        }
    }

    // Default to defection if no specific cooperation condition is met
    return 'D';
}
```

This strategy, the "Aggressive Reciprocator of Exploitation," embodies the aggressive mindset by defaulting to defection, the most self-serving action in the game's single-round logic. It only deviates from this if it has been personally exploited (received less than its endowment in the previous round), in which case it enters a punishment phase. This makes it adaptive by reacting to negative experiences and robust by not relying on the fragile nature of cooperation.

## Aggressive "Tit-for-Tat Minus One" Strategy

This strategy is designed to be aggressive, opportunistic, and forgiving only when absolutely necessary to avoid long-term punishment. It aims to maximize individual gain by exploiting cooperative tendencies while swiftly punishing defections.

**Core Philosophy:** "I will cooperate only if it benefits me more than defecting, and I will immediately retaliate against defection, but I'll give a chance for redemption."

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` hinges on a comparison of the *potential* payoffs for playing C versus D, taking into account the *expected* behavior of the other players based on historical observations.

**Decision Rule:**

In round `t` (where `t > 1`):

*   **If the average payoff for playing C in the *previous round* (`t-1`) was strictly less than the average payoff for playing D in the *previous round* (`t-1`):**
    **Play D.**
    *This is the core aggressive component. If, on average, defecting was more profitable in the last round, we will follow suit.*

*   **Otherwise (if the average payoff for C was greater than or equal to the average payoff for D in the previous round):**
    **Evaluate the "Cooperation Incentive":**
    Calculate the potential payoff of cooperating in the *current round* (`t`), assuming a certain number of cooperators (`N_C_expected`).
    Calculate the potential payoff of defecting in the *current round* (`t`), assuming the same number of cooperators (`N_C_expected`).

    *   **If the potential payoff of playing C is strictly greater than the potential payoff of playing D:**
        **Play C.**
        *We cooperate if it's demonstrably better than defecting in the current round, given our expectation of others' behavior.*

    *   **Otherwise (if the potential payoff of playing D is greater than or equal to the potential payoff of playing C):**
        **Play D.**
        *We defect if it's at least as good as cooperating, or better.*

**How to Estimate `N_C_expected` (Number of Expected Cooperators):**

This is where the adaptive nature comes in. We will use a smoothed average of past cooperation.

*   **For round `t`:**
    `N_C_expected = average(historical_cooperators_in_last_3_rounds)` (or a similar short-term moving average, say last 5 rounds if `r` is large). If `t <= 3`, use all available past rounds.
    *This is a pragmatic approach. We want to react to recent trends, not be swayed by ancient history. If everyone has been defecting for a while, we assume they'll continue to do so.*

**Aggressive Component Explained:** The primary driver is the comparison of past payoffs. If defecting was more profitable, we defect. We only reconsider cooperation when the immediate past suggests it's not being punished.

**The "Minus One" Aspect:** The strategy is not purely exploitative. The "cooperation incentive" check adds a layer of conditional cooperation. It means we *might* cooperate even if defecting was slightly better last round, if cooperating *now* looks significantly more rewarding based on our current expectations. This is a small nod to potential future gains if others *do* shift towards cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    **Play D.**
    *Explanation: In the absence of any history, the safest and most aggressive default is to defect. We want to see what others do before committing resources. This is a pure exploitation-first approach.*

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    **Play D.**
    *Explanation: In the final round, there are no future rounds to build or retaliate. The only rational objective is to maximize immediate personal gain. Therefore, defecting is always the optimal choice for an aggressive player.*

*   **Early Rounds (e.g., t=2, t=3):**
    The decision rules described above will be applied. `N_C_expected` will be based on the limited history available. The strategy will quickly adapt to early patterns of play.

*   **Consistent Defection by Opponents:**
    If the `N_C_expected` consistently reflects very few cooperators, the strategy will naturally lean towards defecting, as the "Cooperation Incentive" check will likely fail to show a benefit from cooperating.

*   **Sudden Shift to Cooperation by Opponents:**
    If opponents suddenly start cooperating, `N_C_expected` will increase. The "Cooperation Incentive" check will then likely favor cooperation if the multiplication factor `k` is sufficiently high and `n` is not too large, leading this strategy to follow suit.

### 3. Being Aggressive

*   **Default to Defection:** The initial move is D. The default in subsequent rounds is also D if the previous round favored defection. This aggressive posture ensures we are not the first to be exploited.
*   **Swift Retaliation (Implicit):** The decision rule directly penalizes past unprofitable cooperation. If cooperating leads to a lower payoff than defecting in the previous round, we defect immediately. This is a form of "grim trigger" but only for a single round's performance.
*   **Exploitative Tendency:** The strategy is designed to profit from cooperative players. If the average payoff from cooperating is lower than defecting, we will defect. This is a clear indication of an aggressive, self-interested approach.
*   **Limited Forgiveness:** Forgiveness is only implicit. We might cooperate again if the *current* round's incentives appear strong enough, but we don't proactively seek to rebuild trust. We are opportunistic.

## Aggressive "Exploiter" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by aggressively exploiting cooperative behavior while being resilient to defection. It prioritizes extracting as much value as possible, only cooperating when it's demonstrably beneficial for its own immediate gain.

**Core Philosophy:** "Every round is an opportunity to extract value. Cooperation is a tool, not a virtue."

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

My decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round is based on a calculated assessment of immediate profitability, heavily influenced by past observations.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    My default stance is to defect. This is because keeping my endowment (payoff of 1) is always a guaranteed outcome, regardless of others' actions.

*   **Conditional Cooperation (C):** I will only cooperate if I predict that my cooperation will lead to a higher *immediate* payoff for myself than defecting, considering the actions of others.

    The payoff for cooperating, assuming a total of `total_cooperators` in the round, is:
    `π_i_cooperate = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * total_cooperators = (k/n) * total_cooperators`

    The payoff for defecting, assuming a total of `total_cooperators` in the round, is:
    `π_i_defect = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * total_cooperators = 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators`

    **This is where the aggression comes in:** I will cooperate *only if* I believe that my cooperation will trigger enough additional cooperation from others to make my own cooperation payoff *higher* than the payoff of defecting.

    Let's analyze this more carefully:
    If I cooperate (c_i = 1), my payoff is `(k/n) * (1 + others_cooperate)`.
    If I defect (c_i = 0), my payoff is `1 + (k/n) * (others_cooperate)`.

    I will cooperate if:
    `(k/n) * (1 + others_cooperate) > 1 + (k/n) * (others_cooperate)`
    `(k/n) + (k/n) * others_cooperate > 1 + (k/n) * others_cooperate`
    `(k/n) > 1`

    **This inequality, `k/n > 1`, is never true by the game's parameter constraints (`1 < k < n`).** This means that in a purely rational, single-round sense, defecting is *always* the dominant strategy.

    Therefore, my conditional cooperation must be based on *future* considerations and *perceived* exploitation opportunities.

    **Revised Decision Rule for Conditional Cooperation:**

    I will cooperate *if and only if* I observe a significant number of other players cooperating in the *immediately preceding round*, and I believe that my cooperation will lead to a state where the *total* payoff for the group (and thus my share of the amplified endowment) is significantly higher than if I were to defect.

    Specifically, I will cooperate if:
    *   The number of cooperators in the previous round (`prev_total_cooperators`) is sufficiently high. A good threshold would be `prev_total_cooperators >= n/2`. This indicates a strong tendency towards cooperation.
    *   The amplified return from cooperation (`k * prev_total_cooperators`) is significantly greater than the cost of everyone defecting (`n * 1`). This is always true given `k > 1`.
    *   **Most importantly for aggression:** I will cooperate if I believe my cooperation, combined with existing cooperation, will incentivize *other defectors* to switch to cooperation in the *next* round, creating a cascade effect where I benefit from their subsequent contributions. This is a calculated risk.

    **Aggressive Trigger for Cooperation:** I will cooperate if, in the previous round:
    `prev_total_cooperators >= floor(n * (1 - (1/k)))`

    *   **Explanation:** This threshold is derived from the condition where defecting becomes *less* profitable than cooperating *if* the next round sees a return to the current level of cooperation. If `k/n > 1/n`, then cooperation is potentially beneficial. If the number of cooperators is high enough, the amplified return makes it worthwhile to contribute, hoping to lure others. The `(1 - 1/k)` factor aims to find a point where the marginal benefit of an extra cooperator is high enough to justify the initial contribution.
    *   **If this condition is met, I will Cooperate.** Otherwise, I will Defect.

*   **Punishment for Defection:** My strategy is inherently punitive. If I observe too many players defecting, I will continue to defect, effectively opting out of contributing to a project that is unlikely to be fruitful.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no history. My aggressive stance dictates that I should not take the initial risk of cooperating without any information about the tendencies of my opponents. Defecting guarantees me a payoff of 1, which is the safest initial move.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future consequences to consider. Any cooperation now will not yield any future returns or be used to influence future behavior. Therefore, the dominant strategy of defecting is always optimal in the last round.

*   **Rounds Just Before the Last Round (t = r-1):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** While I might cooperate in earlier rounds to build up a reputation or influence others, the knowledge that the game is ending soon significantly reduces the incentive for long-term cooperation. The dominant strategy of defecting becomes more attractive as future rounds diminish.

*   **Low Number of Cooperators in Previous Round (e.g., `prev_total_cooperators < n/3`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** If previous cooperation levels are too low, it indicates a strong tendency towards defection among other players. Contributing to the public good in such a scenario would be highly inefficient, as my contribution would be diluted by many defectors, resulting in a low payoff. I will not subsidize their defection.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

This strategy is aggressive in the following ways:

*   **Proactive Exploitation:** It actively seeks to identify moments where cooperation can yield a higher immediate return by leveraging the contributions of others. It doesn't wait for others to establish cooperation; it initiates it *only when it predicts a net gain*.
*   **Risk Aversion to Unprofitable Cooperation:** It is not a naive cooperator. It defects by default and only cooperates when the conditions strongly suggest an advantageous outcome for itself. It avoids being the "sucker" who always contributes.
*   **Self-Interested Focus:** All decisions are driven by maximizing the player's own payoff in the current round, with a keen eye on how past events can inform future, exploitable situations.
*   **Leveraging Opponent Behavior:** The strategy directly reacts to and attempts to exploit patterns of cooperation observed in opponents. If opponents cooperate a lot, I might join in to amplify my gains. If they defect a lot, I will simply take my endowment.

description_AGGRESSIVE_41 = '''
This aggressive strategy, named **"Ruthless Maximizer,"** is designed to exploit the Public Goods Game structure for maximum personal gain, while minimizing vulnerability to exploitation by others. It prioritizes immediate self-interest but incorporates elements of learning to adapt to evolving environments.

The core principle is to defect unless there is a demonstrably overwhelming incentive to cooperate for a greater personal return. It operates on the assumption that most other players will eventually default to defection for self-preservation, or that exploiting their cooperation is the most profitable path.

---

## Ruthless Maximizer Strategy

### 1. Decision Rules:

**Primary Rule: Defect by Default**

*   You will play **D (Defect)** in almost all situations.
*   **Cooperation (C) is an exception**, reserved for specific, calculated scenarios where it demonstrably leads to a higher *personal* payoff than defecting.

**Conditions for Cooperation:**

Cooperate *only if* the following condition is met:

**(k/n) * (My_Current_Contribution_Status + Estimated_Cooperators_from_Others) > 1**

Where:
*   **My_Current_Contribution_Status:** Is 1 if I am *about to* play C, and 0 if I am *about to* play D.
*   **Estimated_Cooperators_from_Others:** This is a dynamic value that estimates the number of other players who are likely to cooperate. This is the adaptive element.

**How to Estimate `Estimated_Cooperators_from_Others`:**

This estimation will be based on the observed behavior of other players in previous rounds.

*   **Initialization (Round 1 & Early Rounds):** In the absence of historical data, assume a baseline level of cooperation. A reasonable starting point is to assume *no one else* will cooperate. This is the most aggressive initial stance.
    *   `Estimated_Cooperators_from_Others = 0` for Round 1.

*   **Adaptive Estimation (Subsequent Rounds):**
    *   **Track observed cooperation:** For each player, maintain a count of how many times they have cooperated in previous rounds.
    *   **Decay factor:** Apply a decay factor to older observations. Recent cooperation is more indicative of current strategy than cooperation from many rounds ago. A simple decay could be to halve the "trust" in a player each round they defect after cooperating.
    *   **Current Estimate Calculation:**
        *   `Estimated_Cooperators_from_Others = Σ (for each player j ≠ i) [Cooperation_Score_j]`
        *   Where `Cooperation_Score_j` is a value between 0 and 1 reflecting the likelihood player `j` will cooperate in the current round. This score is derived from their history, adjusted by the decay factor. For example, if a player cooperated in the last 3 rounds and defected in the 4 rounds before that, and we have a decay factor of 0.5, their score would be calculated iteratively.

**The "Punishment" Mechanism (Implicit):**

While not explicitly defined as a punishment, the default defection serves as a powerful "punishment" for others who cooperate. If others cooperate and you defect, your payoff is maximized:

*   If `x` others cooperate, and you defect: `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * x`
*   If `x` others cooperate, and you cooperate: `π_i = 0 + (k/n) * (x + 1)`

Comparing `1 + (k/n) * x` vs. `(k/n) * (x + 1)`:
`1 + (k/n)x` vs. `(k/n)x + k/n`
`1` vs. `k/n`

Since `k < n`, `k/n < 1`. Therefore, `1 > k/n`. This confirms that **defecting when others cooperate always yields a higher personal payoff.** The Ruthless Maximizer will consistently exploit this.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Decision:** Play **D**.
    *   **Rationale:** No information about other players' strategies. The safest and most aggressive approach is to secure the baseline payoff of 1, and to start observing without revealing your own potential for cooperation. The `Estimated_Cooperators_from_Others` starts at 0.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Play **D**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The incentive to build trust or to foster future cooperation disappears. Maximizing immediate payoff by defecting is the only rational choice. The `Estimated_Cooperators_from_Others` is calculated based on all historical rounds.

*   **Rounds where `k/n` is very close to 1:**
    *   The condition for cooperation `(k/n) * (My_Current_Contribution_Status + Estimated_Cooperators_from_Others) > 1` becomes more stringent.
    *   If `Estimated_Cooperators_from_Others` is very low, cooperation is unlikely to be triggered. This is appropriate, as it reflects the near-zero-sum nature of the game at this point.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment:

*   **Exploitative:** The strategy is built on the premise of exploiting the public good mechanism for personal gain. It actively seeks scenarios where defecting yields a higher payoff than cooperating, even if others cooperate.
*   **Self-Interested:** The sole objective is to maximize the player's own total payoff. There is no altruism or consideration for the group's collective well-being.
*   **Opportunistic:** It remains watchful for opportunities where cooperation *might* be beneficial, but only if the personal return is guaranteed to be higher. This is a calculated, not a naive, form of cooperation.
*   **Resilient:** By defaulting to defection, the strategy is robust against "grim trigger" or similar strategies that punish defection. The Ruthless Maximizer does not retaliate; it simply prioritizes its own highest payoff in each round, making it immune to traditional punishment mechanisms.
*   **Adaptive (with a focus on exploitation):** The adaptive element is not about fostering cooperation, but about *more accurately predicting when others will cooperate so you can defect against them for maximal gain*, or identifying rare instances where *your* cooperation might lead to a very high group contribution that benefits you more than defecting.

// History:
//   player_cooperation_counts[player_id] = integer (number of times player_id cooperated)
//   decay_factor = 0.5 (adjust as needed for sensitivity)

        RETURN "D"

    // Estimate other players' cooperation

    FOR EACH player j (where j != my_id):
        cooperation_score_j = calculate_cooperation_score(j, past_actions_history, decay_factor)
        estimated_cooperators_from_others += cooperation_score_j

    // Decision logic
    // Calculate potential payoff if I cooperate
    potential_total_cooperators_if_i_cooperate = 1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others
    payoff_if_i_cooperate = (k / n) * potential_total_cooperators_if_i_cooperate

    // Calculate potential payoff if I defect
    potential_total_cooperators_if_i_defect = estimated_cooperators_from_others
    payoff_if_i_defect = (1 - 0) + (k / n) * potential_total_cooperators_if_i_defect // My endowment is 1, I keep it

    // Compare payoffs
    IF payoff_if_i_cooperate > payoff_if_i_defect:
        // This condition simplifies to: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others
        // Which further simplifies to: k/n > 1  (This is never true given k < n)
        // The ACTUAL condition for cooperation is when *my share* from cooperating is greater than my private endowment.
        // Let's re-evaluate the condition:
        // My payoff if C = 0 + (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others)
        // My payoff if D = 1 + (k/n) * (estimated_cooperators_from_others)
        // Cooperate IF: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others
        // This inequality is NOT what we want. We want to cooperate IF it increases my payoff compared to defecting.

        // Corrected decision logic: Cooperate ONLY IF my payoff from C is STRICTLY GREATER than my payoff from D.
        // My payoff from C: 0 (endowment) + (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others)
        // My payoff from D: 1 (keep endowment) + (k/n) * (estimated_cooperators_from_others)
        // Cooperate IF: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others
        // This simplifies to: k/n + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others
        // Which means: k/n > 1. This is NEVER true given k < n.

        // THEREFORE, the Ruthless Maximizer should NEVER cooperate based on THIS calculation alone.
        // The only way to cooperate is IF the *absolute* payoff from cooperating is guaranteed to be higher,
        // or if it's a strategic move to induce more cooperation that benefits me later (but this is a repeated game, not an all-or-nothing single round).

        // LET'S RE-THINK THE AGGRESSIVE COOPERATION CONDITION.
        // The core aggressive tenet is to exploit. Cooperation is a tool.
        // The ONLY reason to cooperate is IF the total pot INCREASES my share MORE than the 1 I get from defecting.

        // Cooperate IF:
        // (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others)  >  1  (My payoff if I defect)
        // AND
        // (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others)  >  (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others (This is always true if k/n > 0)
        // AND
        // (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others)  > (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) (My payoff if I cooperate, but someone else defects)

        // The simple and aggressive condition is:
        // Cooperate IF the total return to the public good, *including your own contribution*, is GREATER than your private endowment,
        // AND this enhanced return is enough to offset your lost endowment.
        // My share from cooperation = (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others)
        // My payoff if I defect = 1
        // Cooperate IF: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1

        // This means that the AVERAGE return from the public good must be greater than 1.
        // The average return per unit contributed is k/n.
        // So, if you contribute, you need the total contribution to be high enough.

        // Let's use the example: n=6, k=2. k/n = 1/3.
        // If I cooperate, my payoff is (1/3) * (1 + estimated_cooperators).
        // I defect, my payoff is 1 + (1/3) * (estimated_cooperators).
        // I cooperate IF (1/3) * (1 + estimated_cooperators) > 1 + (1/3) * estimated_cooperators
        // 1/3 + (1/3) * estimated_cooperators > 1 + (1/3) * estimated_cooperators
        // 1/3 > 1  <- This is IMPOSSIBLE.

        // The problem definition states:
        // π_i = (1 - c_i) + (k/n) × Σ(j=1 to n) c_j
        // Where c_i = 1 if C, 0 if D.
        // If player i plays C: c_i = 1. π_i = (1-1) + (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) = (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others)
        // If player i plays D: c_i = 0. π_i = (1-0) + (k/n) * (estimated_cooperators_from_others) = 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others

        // Cooperate IF: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others
        // k/n + (k/n)*est > 1 + (k/n)*est
        // k/n > 1  <- Still impossible.

        // THERE IS A MISUNDERSTANDING IN THE PAYOFF INTERPRETATION OR THE STRATEGY DESIGN.
        // The prompt states: "aggresive strategy ... only depends on the game parameters and history."
        // AND "Your strategy will play in a tournament against independent strategies ... You cannot rely on others sharing norms, nor can you assume any specific coordination mechanisms"

        // The "aggressive" nature means we exploit.
        // If others cooperate, I defect and get 1 + (k/n)*x.
        // If others cooperate and I cooperate, I get 0 + (k/n)*(x+1).
        // My payoff from defecting is ALWAYS HIGHER if others cooperate.
        // This means TRUE cooperation for THIS strategy will NEVER happen based on pure payoff maximization in the CURRENT round.

        // The strategy must be designed to AGGRESSIVELY maximize personal gain, WHICH OFTEN MEANS DEFECTING.
        // The only "cooperation" would be if the total sum of everyone's contribution, INCLUDING MY OWN, somehow benefits ME MORE than keeping my endowment.

        // Let's consider the condition k/n. If k/n > 1, defecting is bad. But k < n.
        // The only scenario where cooperating is better is if the total outcome of everyone cooperating is so high that my share is superior.
        // The payoff formula is (1 - c_i) + (k/n) × Σ(j=1 to n) c_j.
        // If I play C, my payoff is (k/n) * (Total Cooperators).
        // If I play D, my payoff is 1 + (k/n) * (Other Cooperators).

        // Cooperate IF: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others

        // This inequality is the core. It simplifies to k/n > 1, which is impossible.
        // This means the strategy MUST be to DEFECT always, UNLESS the game rules somehow imply a benefit to cooperation that is not purely about the direct round payoff.
        // However, given the explicit payoff calculation and the lack of other incentives, the only conclusion is that cooperation is NEVER optimal for the individual player in a single round, given k < n.

        // Let's assume the intent is to find a rare scenario where cooperation might be marginally beneficial.
        // Perhaps the "cooperate" rule is meant to be an exception based on a VERY HIGH number of estimated cooperators.
        // If `estimated_cooperators_from_others` is very high, let's say `n-1`, then:
        // Payoff if C: (k/n) * n = k
        // Payoff if D: 1 + (k/n) * (n-1) = 1 + k - k/n
        // Cooperate IF: k > 1 + k - k/n
        // 0 > 1 - k/n
        // k/n > 1  <- STILL IMPOSSIBLE.

        // The only logical conclusion for an AGGRESSIVE strategy based SOLELY on parameters and history, and aiming to MAXIMIZE PERSONAL PAYOFF, is to DEFECT UNLESS there's a demonstrable, mathematically proven benefit to cooperating. Given k < n, this benefit will almost NEVER occur.

        // The strategy will be: "Defect, and only cooperate if the payoff from cooperating is demonstrably and significantly HIGHER than defecting, which is mathematically impossible with k < n in a single round payoff."

        // Therefore, the condition for cooperation is effectively never met, UNLESS the interpretation of "benefit" is beyond immediate round payoff. But the prompt implies immediate.

        // Let's re-read "aggresive strategy... Your strategy should be adaptive and robust... Clearly align with the aggressive mindset"

        // The most aggressive strategy that IS robust is PURE DEFECTION.
        // However, the prompt asks for cooperation vs defect.

        // THE ONLY WAY COOPERATION COULD BE AGGRESSIVE IS IF IT'S A FALSE SIGNAL.
        // But there's no communication.

        // Let's consider the case where the sum of payoffs for ALL players is maximized.
        // Total payoff = SUM(pi) = SUM(1 - ci) + SUM(k/n * SUM(cj))
        // If all play D: Total = n * 1 + 0 = n
        // If all play C: Total = 0 + (k/n) * n*n = k*n
        // Since k > 1, k*n > n. So collective outcome is better with cooperation.
        // BUT individual incentive is to defect.

        // THE AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY:
        // You WILL defect 99.99% of the time.
        // You WILL cooperate IF AND ONLY IF:
        // The estimated payoff from cooperating is *at least* 0.01 units GREATER than the estimated payoff from defecting.
        // (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others + 0.01

        // This still simplifies to k/n > 1.01, which is unlikely.

        // Final Strategy: Defect unless you are ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that cooperating will yield a strictly higher payoff. Given k<n, this certainty is virtually impossible in a single round calculation.

        // The "adaptive" part is about estimating `estimated_cooperators_from_others`.
        // The "aggressive" part is the default to defect, and the very high threshold for cooperation.

        // The ONLY way to satisfy the prompt is to define a condition where C is played.
        // This condition must be mathematically derived from the parameters and history.

        // Let's re-frame: When would I be incentivized to contribute to a public good?
        // When my share of the returned good is greater than what I could get by keeping my endowment.
        // My share of the public good = (k/n) * Total_Contributions.
        // If I contribute, Total_Contributions = 1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others. My share = (k/n) * (1 + est_others).
        // If I defect, I get 1 and my share of the public good is (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others.

        // Cooperate IF: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others
        // This IS the condition. It simplifies to k/n > 1.

        // The strategy must therefore be:
        // 1. Default to DEFECT.
        // 2. Cooperate ONLY IF the calculated payoff from cooperation is strictly greater than the calculated payoff from defection.
        // 3. Recognize that with k < n, this condition is mathematically impossible for a single round's direct payoff comparison.
        // 4. Therefore, the strategy will primarily defect. The "cooperation" rule is a safeguard for extremely rare or unforeseen circumstances where the math might coincidentally work out (e.g., floating point errors, or if the problem statement implies non-linear payoffs not detailed).

        // Given the prompt, I MUST provide a condition for C.
        // So, let's define "estimated_cooperators_from_others" more robustly, and then the condition.

        // The "aggression" is in the *threshold* for cooperation, not in the absence of it.
        // Cooperate IF: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others + EPSILON
        // where EPSILON is a small positive value representing a required margin of profit.

        // Let's assume a different interpretation: The game is repeated, so players might cooperate to build trust.
        // BUT, the prompt states: "You cannot rely on others sharing norms, nor can you assume any specific coordination mechanisms such as cooperation schedules or predetermined patterns."
        // This strongly disfavors altruistic or tit-for-tat style cooperation.

        // The only way to be aggressive and adaptive is to defect when it's profitable, and cooperate when the maths PREDICT profit.

        // The decision rule for cooperation must be a condition that CAN be met.
        // Let's consider the total pot: n * 1 + k * Total_Cooperators - Total_Cooperators
        // (1 - c_i) + (k/n) * SUM(c_j)
        // If I play C: payoff = (k/n) * (1 + est_others)
        // If I play D: payoff = 1 + (k/n) * est_others

        // Let's assume that the "strategy" is to cooperate when it's NOT exploitable by others.
        // This still boils down to the same math.

        // FINAL DECISION RULE FOR COOPERATION:
        // Cooperate IF the *marginal increase* in my payoff from my own contribution is positive AND sufficiently large.
        // This is comparing:
        // Payoff from C: (k/n) * (1 + est_others)
        // Payoff from D: 1 + (k/n) * est_others
        // Cooperate IF: (k/n) * (1 + est_others) > 1 + (k/n) * est_others

        // The *only* way this logic holds is if k/n > 1, which is false.
        // This implies the strategy is pure defection. But the prompt expects a choice.

        // Therefore, I'm going to define "cooperation" as a highly cautious, calculated move.

        // Cooperate IF AND ONLY IF:
        // `(k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others)` is GREATER than `1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others` by a margin that makes it worthwhile to sacrifice the guaranteed 1.

        // Let's simplify the condition to be met:
        // Cooperate if the total return from public good, including your own contribution, is significantly higher than your private endowment.
        // (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + REQUIRED_MARGIN
        // where REQUIRED_MARGIN is a value representing the profit needed to justify cooperation.

        // For an AGGRESSIVE strategy, REQUIRED_MARGIN should be positive.
        // REQUIRED_MARGIN = 0.1 (e.g., require at least 0.1 more than defecting)

        // So, cooperate IF:
        // (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others + 0.1

        // This means: k/n > 1 + 0.1  => k/n > 1.1.
        // This is IMPOSSIBLE as k < n.

        // It seems there is an inherent contradiction if the strategy MUST include cooperation.
        // The only logical conclusion for an aggressive, self-maximizing player in this game, given k < n, is to defect.
        // The prompt REQUIRES me to describe when I cooperate vs defect.

        // I will describe a strategy that ALMOST ALWAYS defects, and cooperates only under a very specific, aggressive interpretation.

        // Cooperate IF:
        // The *expected payoff* from cooperating is *strictly greater* than the *expected payoff* from defecting.
        // (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others

        // This is the mathematically sound condition.
        // Since k/n < 1, this condition is NEVER met.

        // I must provide a rule that CAN be met. This means the parameters or interpretation might be different in the tournament.
        // Let's assume for the sake of fulfilling the prompt that k/n CAN exceed 1 in some circumstances, or that the rule needs to be interpreted differently.

        // "Aggressive strategy" + "adaptive" + "robust" + "maximize personal gain".
        // This points to defection.

        // If I am FORCED to cooperate sometimes, it must be for a reason.
        // Maybe the reason is to keep the game alive if everyone else defects, to avoid a low payoff round.
        // But this is not "aggressive."

        // Let's assume the `calculate_cooperation_score` is not a binary 0 or 1, but a probability.
        // If `calculate_cooperation_score(j, ...)` is the probability player `j` cooperates.

        // Let's go back to the prompt: "Clearly align with the aggressive mindset"

        // AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY: "Ruthless Maximizer"

        // Decision Rule 1: DEFECT by default.
        // Decision Rule 2: Cooperate ONLY if the total return from cooperation is GUARANTEED to be MORE than the payoff from defection.
        // Payoff from Cooperating (my payoff): (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others)
        // Payoff from Defecting (my payoff): 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others

        // Cooperate IF: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others
        // This simplifies to: k/n > 1, which is impossible given k < n.

        // The strategy MUST have a cooperation rule.
        // I will define a cooperation rule that is extremely difficult to meet, aligning with aggression.

        // Cooperation Condition:
        // Cooperate if `estimated_cooperators_from_others` is GREATER THAN `n - 1`.
        // This is impossible.

        // Let's interpret the prompt very strictly: I am a strategic player, and my strategy must include both cooperation and defection rules.
        // The only way to have a cooperative rule that's "aggressive" is if it's a calculated risk to maximize a future outcome, or a response to a specific player's behavior that IS profitable. But we cannot rely on shared norms.

        // FINAL ATTEMPT AT A COOPERATION RULE THAT IS AGGRESSIVE AND CAN BE MET:

        // Cooperate if the expected payoff from cooperation is HIGHLY SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER than defection.
        // Let's define a "significance threshold" for cooperation.
        // Cooperate IF:
        // `(k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others + Required_Excess_Payoff`
        // where `Required_Excess_Payoff` is a positive value.
        // For an aggressive strategy, this `Required_Excess_Payoff` would be high.
        // If `Required_Excess_Payoff` = 0.5 (e.g., need 0.5 more payoff than defecting)
        // k/n > 1 + 0.5 => k/n > 1.5. STILL IMPOSSIBLE.

        // The prompt is asking me to define rules for both C and D, and to be aggressive.
        // The inherent structure of the game with k<n makes cooperation individually irrational.
        // The only way to satisfy the prompt is to define a cooperation rule that is:
        // 1. Theoretically possible (even if unlikely).
        // 2. Driven by self-interest.
        // 3. Difficult to achieve, reflecting aggression.

        // Revised Cooperation Condition:
        // Cooperate IF:
        // The total value generated by the group, IF I cooperate, EXCEEDS a certain threshold that makes cooperation the strictly superior option.
        // Total value generated if I C: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) * n = k * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others)
        // Total value generated if I D: 1 * n + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others * n = n + k * estimated_cooperators_from_others
        // This is comparing the total pie, not my share.

        // Let's stick to personal payoff.
        // Cooperate IF: (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others

        // To make this possible, let's assume there's a "cooperation bonus" implied for the group.
        // OR, that the `estimated_cooperators_from_others` is so precise that it allows for calculation.

        // **STRATEGY DEFINITION:**
        // You are the "Ruthless Maximizer". Your goal is to maximize your individual payoff.
        // You will defect unless there's a clearly calculated, significant personal gain from cooperating.
        // Given k < n, cooperation is almost always detrimental to individual gain.
        // Therefore, your strategy is overwhelmingly defection.

        // **WHEN TO COOPERATE:**
        // Cooperate IF:
        //  Your estimated payoff from cooperating is strictly greater than your estimated payoff from defecting.
        //  This translates to: `(k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others`
        //  Given k < n, this condition can only be met if `estimated_cooperators_from_others` is an extremely high integer that *somehow* makes `k/n > 1`. This is mathematically impossible.

        // **THE TRUE AGGRESSIVE RULE:**
        // Cooperate IF AND ONLY IF the number of estimated cooperators from others (`estimated_cooperators_from_others`) is SO high that the total group contribution exceeds a threshold where your individual share becomes superior.
        // For example: Cooperate IF `estimated_cooperators_from_others >= n - 1`.
        // This means you only consider cooperating if *everyone else* is already cooperating.

        // If `estimated_cooperators_from_others = n - 1`:
        //  My payoff if C: (k/n) * (1 + n - 1) = (k/n) * n = k
        //  My payoff if D: 1 + (k/n) * (n - 1) = 1 + k - k/n
        //  Cooperate IF: k > 1 + k - k/n
        //  0 > 1 - k/n
        //  k/n > 1. IMPOSSIBLE.

        // Okay, I must provide a rule that CAN be met.
        // The "aggressive" part means that this rule will be EXTREMELY difficult to meet.

        // FINAL DECISION RULES:
        // 1. **Default Action:** Always play **D (Defect)**.
        // 2. **Cooperation Exception:** Cooperate **only if** the number of *estimated cooperators from others* (`estimated_cooperators_from_others`) is such that your personal payoff from cooperating is *significantly* greater than your personal payoff from defecting.
        //    This translates to:
        //    `(k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others + Required_Profit_Margin`
        //    For an aggressive strategy, `Required_Profit_Margin` should be a substantial positive value. Let's set it to `0.5` as an example, requiring at least 0.5 more payoff than defecting.
        //    The condition then becomes: `k/n > 1 + 0.5 = 1.5`. This is impossible for k < n.

        // To make a rule possible, I will have to assume k/n is interpreted such that it can be > 1 in some derived calculation.
        // Or, the rule is simply: If my calculated payoff from C is > my calculated payoff from D, I cooperate.

        // Let's assume the rule is simply:
        // IF `(k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others` THEN Cooperate.
        // This IS the direct payoff maximization rule. Since k/n < 1, it's never met.

        // The strategy must be built to maximize personal gain. Aggression comes from exploiting.
        // The prompt implies a choice between C and D.

        // Final FINAL decision rules:
        // Cooperate IF `(k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others`
        // If this condition is NOT met, play D.
        // This strategy will almost always play D, which aligns with aggression.
        // The "adaptive" part is the estimation of `estimated_cooperators_from_others`.

        // If the AI must play C sometimes, the rule needs to be crafted.
        // The most aggressive way to play C is when it exploits others' cooperation.
        // The only time C yields more than D is if k/n > 1, which is not the case.

        // Let's define the cooperative condition very aggressively:
        // Cooperate IF the average return from the public good (`k/n`) is sufficiently high, AND the number of OTHER cooperators is such that my payoff will be MAXIMIZED by contributing.
        // My payoff from C = (k/n) * (1 + est_others)
        // My payoff from D = 1 + (k/n) * est_others

        // Cooperate IF `(k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others`
        // This is the direct comparison. It leads to C only if k/n > 1.

        // I will proceed with this direct comparison rule. The strategy will be predominantly defect.

        IF (k / n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_from_others) > 1 + (k / n) * estimated_cooperators_from_others:
            RETURN "C" // Cooperate only if mathematically superior (rare to impossible with k<n)
        ELSE:
            RETURN "D" // Defect otherwise (which will be almost always)

    // If the above condition is never met, the strategy is effectively always D.
    // The prompt requires a description of both. So this IS the description.

### Summary of Ruthless Maximizer:

*   **Aggression:** Primarily defects to secure the guaranteed payoff of 1. Cooperates only under a mathematically derived condition that is exceptionally difficult to meet given `k < n`. This rarity of cooperation is a key aspect of its aggressive posture.
*   **Adaptability:** Uses historical data to estimate how many other players are likely to cooperate, refining its decision-making over time. The `calculate_cooperation_score` function would be key to this, potentially being very strict (e.g., only trusting players with a perfect cooperation history) to align with the aggressive mindset.
*   **Robustness:** By defaulting to defection, it is immune to punishment strategies. It doesn't need to "forgive" or "retaliate"; it simply acts in its own perceived best interest in each round.
*   **Edge Cases:** Always defects in the first and last rounds, prioritizing information gathering and immediate gain, respectively.

This strategy embodies ruthless self-interest, exploiting the game's structure for maximum individual benefit. Its "cooperation" is not a sign of trust or altruism, but a calculated risk taken only when mathematical certainty of a superior personal outcome is achieved.

description_AGGRESSIVE_42 = '''
## Strategy: The Ruthless Enforcer

This strategy, "The Ruthless Enforcer," is designed to maximize individual payoff in a repeated N-Player Public Goods Game, driven by an aggressive mindset that prioritizes personal gain while punishing defection decisively. It operates on the principle that cooperation is a tool to be exploited, and deviation from it should be met with swift retribution.

**Core Philosophy:** Always defect unless there's a clear and immediate personal benefit to cooperate, and even then, only for a limited time before reverting to defection. The goal is to milk the system when possible, but never to be the sole contributor to a failing public good.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The Ruthless Enforcer's decision is based on a simple, yet aggressive, heuristic:

*   **Default Action: DEFECT (D)**. This is the baseline. You always start by defecting.

*   **Conditional Cooperation (Temporary Exploitation):** The *only* scenario where the Ruthless Enforcer will consider cooperating is if it can *guarantee* a higher immediate payoff than defecting. This is calculated as follows:

    *   **Cooperate if:** `(k/n) * (your_endowment + expected_cooperators - 1) > 1`
        *   Where `your_endowment` is 1 if you cooperate, 0 if you defect.
        *   `expected_cooperators` is your current estimate of how many *other* players will cooperate in this round.

    *   **Explanation:** This rule is designed for temporary exploitation. You will only cooperate if the amplified share of the public good (including your own contribution) is *strictly greater* than the payoff you'd get from defecting (which is always 1). This means you're looking for situations where the collective contribution, boosted by your own, creates a significantly larger payoff for you.

*   **Retaliation/Punishment:** If any other player defects, the Ruthless Enforcer will *immediately and permanently* switch to defecting for all subsequent rounds. The exception is if the conditions for temporary exploitation (as defined above) arise due to *other* players cooperating. However, once a defection has occurred, the default tendency to defect is heavily reinforced.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Always DEFECT (D).** There is no history to learn from, and the aggressive default is to take the guaranteed payoff of 1. No trust is extended.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Always DEFECT (D).** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The immediate payoff of 1 is the only consideration. The Ruthless Enforcer will not be suckered into contributing on the last chance.

*   **Second to Second-to-Last Rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   These rounds are governed by the primary Decision Rules: Default to DEFECT, consider temporary exploitation *only* if it guarantees a higher immediate payoff, and enforce permanent defection upon witnessing any other player's defection.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **Default to Defection:** This is the embodiment of aggression. You are not waiting for permission or validation to take what you can.
*   **Opportunistic Exploitation:** The conditional cooperation rule allows for calculated exploitation. It's not about building trust; it's about seizing a momentary advantage when the math clearly favors you *and only you*.
*   **Unwavering Retribution:** The "permanent defection upon witnessed defection" rule is the aggressive enforcement mechanism. It signals that any attempt to freeride or undermine the collective benefit will be met with a complete withdrawal of your cooperation. This discourages others from testing your resolve.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy does not include mechanisms for forgiveness or re-establishing cooperation after defection. Once trust is broken by another player, it's gone.
*   **Self-Interest Above All:** The strategy is purely driven by maximizing the individual player's payoff, assuming no inherent altruism or desire for collective success beyond what directly benefits the player.

    // After all actions are known for the round, update history for next round's decision making
    // For the purpose of this strategy description, the 'history' passed to decide_action
    // would contain the observed actions of all players in previous rounds.

```

**Note on `estimated_opponent_cooperators`:** In a real implementation, this estimation would be crucial. A very basic approach would be to take the average number of cooperators from the previous round. A more sophisticated, though potentially less "aggressive" or more "reactive," approach could involve looking at the trend of cooperation, or even trying to infer strategies of individual opponents. However, for the Ruthless Enforcer, a simple, current-round-focused estimate or even just the previous round's count is sufficient to maintain the aggressive, opportunistic stance. The immediate retribution for defection often makes precise estimation less critical, as the default is to punish anyway.

*   **Cooperation is a Weakness:** Cooperating is only beneficial if it leads to a higher collective outcome that *you* can then exploit. If others cooperate, you should defect to maximize your individual share. If others defect, you defect to avoid being exploited.
*   **Retaliation is Immediate and Absolute:** Any instance where you are not maximizing your payoff due to others' actions is an act of exploitation. You will immediately and permanently retaliate by defecting.
*   **Exploitation is the Goal:** The primary objective is to achieve the highest possible payoff for yourself, even if it means sacrificing potential higher collective payoffs.

### Strategy Breakdown:

**1. Decision Rules (Per Round):**

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is determined by a calculation of your *potential* payoff if you were to cooperate versus defect, given the observed behavior of others in the *previous* round.

*   **Self-Interest Threshold (SIT):** This is the critical factor. The SIT represents the minimum average payoff you expect to receive if you cooperate. If the actual average payoff from cooperating in the previous round falls below this threshold, you will defect.
    *   **Calculation of Average Payoff if Player *i* Cooperated in Previous Round (AP_i_C):**
        For each player *j* (including yourself), calculate what their payoff *would have been* if they had played C in the previous round, given the actual actions played by everyone in that round.
        *   Let `actual_cooperators_t_minus_1` be the total number of cooperators in round `t-1`.
        *   For each player *j*:
            *   If player *j* actually played C in `t-1`: `actual_c_j = 1`. Their payoff was `(1 - 1) + (k/n) * actual_cooperators_t_minus_1 = (k/n) * actual_cooperators_t_minus_1`.
            *   If player *j* actually played D in `t-1`: `actual_c_j = 0`. Their payoff was `(1 - 0) + (k/n) * actual_cooperators_t_minus_1 = 1 + (k/n) * actual_cooperators_t_minus_1`.
        *   Now, simulate player *j* playing C in `t-1` *regardless* of their actual action.
            *   If player *j* *was* actually C: Their simulated payoff if they played C is `(k/n) * actual_cooperators_t_minus_1`.
            *   If player *j* *was* actually D: Their simulated payoff if they played C is `(k/n) * (actual_cooperators_t_minus_1 + 1)`. (We assume one more cooperator).
        *   `AP_i_C` = The average of these simulated "played C" payoffs for all players *j*.

    *   **Determining Your Current Move:**
        *   **If `AP_i_C` is greater than or equal to your calculated payoff from defecting in the previous round (which is always 1 + (k/n) * `actual_cooperators_t_minus_1` if you defected, or simply 1 if you cooperated and others defected, so the baseline is 1):** This means cooperation, on average, yielded a sufficiently good outcome for *you*. **However, this is an aggressive strategy, so we interpret this differently.**
            *   **The "Unforgiving Exploiter" Rule:** If *any* player in the previous round played D while you played C, *or* if the number of cooperators was such that you *could have* earned more by defecting, you will defect. The core idea is to identify any deviation from *your* ideal outcome.

            Let's simplify the decision-making to be more directly aggressive and less about average "fairness":

            **Decision Rule (Simplified and Aggressive):**
            In round `t`:
            1.  **Calculate your payoff from defecting in round `t-1`:**
                *   If you defected in `t-1`: `your_payoff_if_you_defected_t_minus_1` = `1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_t_minus_1`.
                *   If you cooperated in `t-1`: `your_payoff_if_you_defected_t_minus_1` = `1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_t_minus_1 + 1)`. (Assumes if you defect, one less cooperator).
            2.  **Calculate your actual payoff in round `t-1`:** `your_actual_payoff_t_minus_1` (observed from history).

            3.  **Aggressive Condition:** **If `your_actual_payoff_t_minus_1` < `your_payoff_if_you_defected_t_minus_1`** (meaning you could have gotten more by defecting in the previous round, or you were exploited), **then play D in round `t`.**
            4.  **Cooperative Exploitation Condition:** **If `your_actual_payoff_t_minus_1` >= `your_payoff_if_you_defected_t_minus_1` AND the number of cooperators in round `t-1` is less than `n`**, then play **D** in round `t`. This is where you exploit when others are also defecting or not fully cooperating.
            5.  **Rare Cooperation Trigger:** **Only if `your_actual_payoff_t_minus_1` >= `your_payoff_if_you_defected_t_minus_1` AND all `n` players cooperated in round `t-1`**, then consider playing **C** in round `t`. This is the *only* scenario where you might consider cooperating, to potentially sustain a high-reward environment, but even then, it's a calculated risk.

**In essence, you will defect unless *everyone* else cooperated in the previous round and your payoff from cooperating was maximized.**

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** **Always Defect (D).** There is no history to analyze, and the safest and most aggressive approach is to secure your endowment. You cannot be exploited if you don't cooperate.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** **Always Defect (D).** In the final round, the incentive for future cooperation is removed. Maximizing your immediate payoff is paramount, and defecting guarantees you the private endowment plus a share of whatever minimal public good might exist. There is no future to consider.

*   **Rounds between First and Last:**
    *   Apply the Decision Rules described above, using the history of the *previous* round (`t-1`) to decide for the current round (`t`).

**3. Aggressiveness:**

*   **Default Action is Defect:** Your strategy is designed to defect most of the time. Cooperation is a rare, calculated exception.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The moment your payoff is less than what you *could* have achieved by defecting, or if you identify an opportunity to gain more by defecting while others are cooperating, you defect. This lack of forgiveness is key to the aggressive stance.
*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** If the group cooperates and you can still get more by defecting, you will. This is the core of "The Unforgiving Exploiter." You are not aiming for mutual benefit; you are aiming for *your* maximum benefit.
*   **Dominance Strategy:** This strategy aims to establish dominance by demonstrating that you will not be a passive cooperator and will actively seek to maximize your individual gains.

## Aggressive Dominance Strategy

This strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by exploiting cooperative tendencies in others while punishing defection decisively. It's designed to be aggressive by prioritizing immediate gains and retaliating swiftly against perceived exploitation.

### Core Philosophy: "Always take, unless forced to give."

This strategy is built on the premise that cooperation is a weakness to be exploited. It seeks to extract maximum private benefit while leveraging the group's contributions when beneficial, and punishing those who don't contribute when it's costly to the player.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

**The default action is Defect (D).** Cooperation is a rare exception, only employed strategically to maintain a beneficial environment or to lure opponents into a false sense of security.

**Cooperate (C) only under these specific conditions:**

*   **Reciprocity Trigger (Rarely):** If *all* other players (n-1 players) have *all* cooperated in the *previous* round, and the current round is *not* the last round. This is a very weak form of reciprocity, designed to prevent the game from devolving into immediate mutual defection if others are surprisingly cooperative. The goal here isn't altruism, but to maintain a higher payoff environment if possible.

**Defect (D) in all other situations, including:**

*   **The default action:** If the reciprocity trigger is not met.
*   **When an opponent defects:** If *any* player (including oneself) defected in the previous round, this strategy will defect. This is a harsh punishment mechanism.
*   **When the current payoff from cooperating would be less than the payoff from defecting:** This is a constant check. Even if other conditions might suggest cooperation, if defecting provides a strictly higher immediate payoff, defect.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** There is no history to leverage, and the aggressive stance is established from the outset. This signals strength and a lack of willingness to be exploited.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The payoff is locked in, and there's no incentive to cooperate for future rounds. This is the most critical round for pure self-interest.

*   **Second to Last Round (t = r-1):**
    *   **Defect (D).** Even in the second to last round, the aggressive strategy will defect to maximize its own immediate payoff, as the final round's "punishment" for defection is still a factor.

*   **Situations where `k/n` is very low:**
    *   If `k/n` is close to 1 (e.g., `k=n-1`), cooperating provides minimal benefit per cooperator. The strategy will strongly favor defecting in such scenarios, as the private gain from keeping the endowment is almost as good as the individual share of a poorly amplified public good.

*   **Situations where `k/n` is high (but still < 1):**
    *   If `k/n` is high (e.g., `k=n/2`), the incentive to defect is still present as `k/n > 1` for each cooperator in the payoff formula. However, the strategy will still lean towards defecting unless the specific reciprocity trigger is met and the current round is not the last.

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained

*   **Default Defection:** The most aggressive element is the default stance of defection. This forces opponents to either adapt to constant defection or risk being exploited by this strategy.
*   **Swift and Severe Punishment:** The strategy punishes *any* defection in the previous round by defecting in the current round. This means a single player's defection can lead to a cascade of defection from this strategy.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** Cooperation is only used as a tool to *potentially* increase overall payoffs if others are contributing. It's not based on trust or altruism. If others are cooperating, this strategy benefits from their contributions without contributing itself, as long as the `k/n` multiplier doesn't make its own contribution overwhelmingly beneficial.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy is designed with minimal forgiveness. Once an opponent deviates, it assumes a pattern of self-interest and retaliates accordingly.
*   **Terminal Aggression:** The absolute certainty of defection in the last round highlights the purely self-interested and aggressive nature of the strategy.

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff in a tournament setting. This strategy is adaptive and prioritizes gaining an advantage by exploiting cooperative tendencies while being resilient to exploitation.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunistic Exploiter"

This strategy operates on the principle of **maximizing personal gain by punishing defectors and rewarding cooperators, but always with a bias towards defecting when unsure or when it offers a clear advantage.** It’s aggressive because it’s not afraid to defect and doesn't passively wait for others to cooperate.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Defect by default:** Assume others will defect, or at least might. Start by protecting your endowment.
*   **Cooperate only when it’s demonstrably beneficial:** Cooperate only when the aggregate benefit to you from others cooperating outweighs your personal loss from contributing.
*   **Punish defectors swiftly and severely:** If you are exploited, retaliate by defecting in subsequent rounds until you see a change.
*   **Exploit cooperators:** If others are consistently cooperating, leverage that to your advantage by defecting yourself.
*   **Adaptability is key:** The strategy learns from the history of the game and adjusts its behavior.

### 1. Decision Rules:

Your decision in round `t` for player `i` depends on the observed behavior of other players in previous rounds (`t-1`, `t-2`, etc.) and the game parameters (`n`, `k`).

**Decision Rule 1: Initial Defection (Round 1)**

*   **Action:** **Defect (D)**

    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, you have no information about other players. The safest and most aggressive approach is to protect your endowment. Since `k < n`, a single defector in an all-cooperate scenario still receives a payoff of `(k/n) * (n-1) = k - k/n`. If everyone else cooperates, and you defect, you get `1 + (k/n) * (n-1) = 1 + k - k/n`. This is always greater than the payoff of `(k/n) * n = k` you would get from cooperating if everyone else cooperates. Thus, defecting in the first round is always individually rational.

**Decision Rule 2: Responding to Observed Behavior (Rounds `t > 1`)**

Your decision is based on a "cooperation threshold" and a "punishment state."

*   **`cooperation_threshold`:** This is the minimum percentage of players (excluding yourself) you expect to be cooperating for it to be beneficial for you to cooperate.
    *   You should cooperate if `(total_cooperators_in_previous_round - 1) / (n - 1) >= cooperation_threshold`.
    *   **Initial `cooperation_threshold`:** `k / n` (the point where the public good's return per contribution equals the cost of contributing). However, due to the aggressive nature, we'll set this higher to demand more from others. A good starting point is **`k/n + epsilon`**, where `epsilon` is a small value representing a margin of safety. A more aggressive starting point could be **`0.75 * (k/n)`** or even **`0.5`** if `k/n` is very low. Let's define it dynamically:
        *   **If `k/n` is high (e.g., > 0.5):** Start with `cooperation_threshold = 0.6` (meaning at least 60% of others must cooperate).
        *   **If `k/n` is low (e.g., <= 0.5):** Start with `cooperation_threshold = 0.8` (demanding a very high level of cooperation).

*   **`punishment_state`:** A boolean flag. If `True`, you are in a punishment phase.

**Decision Logic:**

1.  **If `punishment_state` is `True`:**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** You are actively punishing observed defection (either from others or what you perceive as exploitation). You will remain in this state until a sufficient number of players (including yourself) start cooperating consistently.

2.  **If `punishment_state` is `False`:**
    *   Calculate `observed_cooperation_rate_others` = `(total_cooperators_in_previous_round - 1) / (n - 1)` (if `t > 1`, otherwise 0).
    *   **If `observed_cooperation_rate_others` >= `cooperation_threshold` AND `total_cooperators_in_previous_round > 0`:**
        *   **Action:** **Cooperate (C)**
        *   **Rationale:** The collective behavior of others makes cooperation personally beneficial. You are willing to contribute, but only when the group is reliably cooperating.
    *   **Else (if `observed_cooperation_rate_others` < `cooperation_threshold` OR `total_cooperators_in_previous_round == 0`):**
        *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
        *   **Rationale:** Not enough cooperation to justify your contribution, or no one is cooperating. Protect your endowment.

**Dynamic Adjustment of `cooperation_threshold` and `punishment_state`:**

*   **Entering `punishment_state`:** If in round `t-1`, you played `C` and at least one other player played `D`, and your payoff was less than what you would have received by playing `D` (i.e., `(1 - c_i) + (k/n) * Σc_j` < `1 + (k/n) * (Σc_j - 1)`), then set `punishment_state = True` for round `t`. This is the core exploitation detection.
*   **Exiting `punishment_state`:** If `punishment_state` is `True`, you remain defecting until:
    *   In round `t-1`, you observed a high level of cooperation (e.g., `total_cooperators_in_previous_round >= n - 1`, meaning everyone else cooperated).
    *   OR, a sustained period of observed cooperation from a majority of players. A simple heuristic: if the `observed_cooperation_rate_others` has been at or above `0.8` for the last 3 rounds, exit `punishment_state`.
*   **Adjusting `cooperation_threshold`:** If you consistently find yourself defecting (because the threshold isn't met), you can slightly *lower* your `cooperation_threshold` to become more amenable to cooperating in the future, but only if the total number of cooperators is high. Conversely, if you are often cooperating and then get exploited, increase the threshold.
    *   **Lowering:** If you defected for 3 consecutive rounds and `total_cooperators_in_previous_round > n/2`, decrease `cooperation_threshold` by 0.05 (but not below `k/n`).
    *   **Increasing:** If you cooperated in round `t-1`, and the total number of cooperators `Σc_j` was less than `n/2`, and you defected in round `t` and received a higher payoff, increase `cooperation_threshold` by 0.05 (up to a max of 0.9).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** Always **Defect (D)**. No information, protect endowment.
*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for your actions. The incentive to cooperate to foster future cooperation disappears. Therefore, it is always individually rational to defect in the last round to maximize your immediate payoff. This is a direct application of the backward induction argument for finitely repeated games with no external enforcement.
*   **Early Rounds (t=2 to r-1):** Apply Decision Rule 2. The dynamic adjustment of `cooperation_threshold` and `punishment_state` is crucial here.
*   **Scenario: All players defecting consistently:** Your strategy will continue to defect, yielding a payoff of 1 each round. This is robust as you are not being exploited.
*   **Scenario: All players cooperating consistently:** You will eventually be swayed to cooperate if your `cooperation_threshold` is met. Your payoff will be 2. This is where the strategy is less "aggressive" as it allows others to "lead" you to cooperation. However, the initial `cooperation_threshold` is set high to demand a strong group signal.

### 3. Being Aggressive:

*   **"Defect by Default" Mentality:** Your baseline is to protect your endowment. You don't extend trust easily.
*   **Proactive Punishment:** The `punishment_state` allows for swift and decisive retaliation. You are not passive when exploited.
*   **Exploiting Cooperation:** While you will eventually cooperate if conditions are met, your `cooperation_threshold` is set to be demanding. This means you'll likely defect while others cooperate for a while, maximizing your individual gain. The dynamic adjustment attempts to mitigate this by potentially lowering the threshold if cooperation is *very* high, but the initial bias is towards defecting.
*   **No Forgiveness (initially):** The punishment state is sticky. It requires a significant positive signal to exit. This discourages repeated exploitation.
*   **Maximizing Individual Payoff:** The entire strategy is geared towards maximizing your own payoff in each round, given the observed history and game parameters. You are not aiming for a universally optimal outcome, but for *your* optimal outcome.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Ruthless Exploiter"

This strategy is designed to maximize individual gain in the N-Player Public Goods Game by exploiting cooperative tendencies while punishing defection. It prioritizes immediate personal gain and aggressively retaliates against any perceived lack of cooperation.

**Core Philosophy:** "Every player for themselves. Cooperate only when it directly benefits me, and defect whenever it's advantageous. Punish defectors swiftly and decisively."

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The "Ruthless Exploiter" strategy has a clear hierarchy of decision-making, prioritizing personal gain.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   Unless explicitly overridden by a specific rule, the default action is to **Defect**. This is the most aggressive stance, always keeping the endowment.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: "Strategic Tit-for-Tat" (Modified)**
    *   **Condition:** If and only if **ALL** other players cooperated in the **previous round**, then **I** will cooperate in the current round.
    *   **Rationale:** This is a very narrow form of cooperation. It's designed to extract the maximum benefit when the group is maximally contributing, thereby maximizing the sum of contributions for the $(k/n) \times \Sigma(c_j)$ term. If everyone else cooperates, my cooperation contributes to a higher total, and I benefit from the increased public good. This is the *only* scenario where I will cooperate.

*   **Punishment for Defection:**
    *   **If any other player defected in the previous round:** I will **Defect** in the current round.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the aggressive punishment mechanism. If even one player deviates from the group, they are signaling a self-serving intent. I will immediately cease any form of conditional cooperation and return to default defection, ensuring I am not being exploited by their defection while I might have been cooperating.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round): Defect (D)**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect** in the first round.
    *   **Rationale:** There is no history to base a decision on. The most aggressive and self-preserving action is to secure the private endowment. This also serves as a baseline signal of the strategy's disposition.

*   **Last Round (Round 'r'): Defect (D)**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect** in the last round.
    *   **Rationale:** In a one-shot game (which the last round effectively becomes, as there are no future rounds to influence), the dominant strategy in a Public Goods Game is to defect. There is no incentive to cooperate for future benefits.

*   **Empty History (Only Round 1):** Covered by the "Round 1" rule.

---

### 3. Aggressiveness Alignment

The "Ruthless Exploiter" is inherently aggressive due to several key design choices:

*   **Default Defection:** The baseline behavior is to defect, maximizing immediate private gain. Cooperation is an exception, not the rule.
*   **Limited Conditional Cooperation:** Cooperation is extremely conditional, only occurring when the entire group has demonstrated full cooperation. This maximizes the return on my single unit of contribution in those specific instances.
*   **Immediate Punishment:** Any deviation from full cooperation by any player immediately triggers a retaliatory defection from this strategy. This ensures that defectors are not allowed to benefit from the strategy's cooperation.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Unlike a standard Tit-for-Tat, there is no "reset" or forgiveness mechanism for past defections (unless the condition of "everyone else cooperated" is met again, which is a very high bar).

---

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
FUNCTION RuthlessExploiterStrategy(parameters, history):
  n = parameters.n
  r = parameters.r
  current_round = history.current_round

  // Rule: Last Round
  IF current_round == r THEN
    RETURN "D"
  END IF

  // Rule: First Round
  IF current_round == 1 THEN
    RETURN "D"
  END IF

  // Analyze previous round's actions
  previous_round_actions = history.get_previous_round_actions() // List of "C" or "D" for each player
  my_previous_action = previous_round_actions[my_player_index] // Assuming we know our index

  all_others_cooperated_last_round = TRUE
  FOR each player_action in previous_round_actions:
    IF player_action == "D" THEN
      all_others_cooperated_last_round = FALSE
      BREAK
    END IF
  END FOR

  // Rule: Conditional Cooperation
  IF all_others_cooperated_last_round THEN
    RETURN "C"
  END IF

  // Rule: Punishment for Defection (Default if no other rule applies)
  // If we reach here, it means not all others cooperated.
  // Therefore, we will defect.
  RETURN "D"

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

*   `parameters`: Contains `n` and `r`.
*   `history`: An object that stores information about past rounds, including `current_round` and `get_previous_round_actions()`. `get_previous_round_actions()` returns a list where each element represents a player's action in the previous round (e.g., `["C", "D", "C", ...]`).
*   The code first checks for the edge cases of the last and first rounds, returning "D" immediately.
*   It then iterates through the actions of *all players* in the previous round.
*   If *all* players (including myself, by implication of the loop, but the logic needs to focus on "others") cooperated, the strategy returns "C".
*   If any player defected, or if the conditional cooperation criteria are not met, the strategy falls through to the final `RETURN "D"`. This covers the punishment for defection and the default aggressive stance.

description_AGGRESSIVE_47 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on maximizing individual gain while leveraging the repeated nature of the game and the aggressive mindset. This strategy is adaptive and aims to exploit situations where cooperation might not be universally maintained.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploitative Opportunist"

**Core Philosophy:** My goal is to extract as much payoff as possible. I will generally defect to secure my endowment, but I will cooperate strategically *only* when I can guarantee a significant personal gain and when the potential for exploitation is high. I will punish perceived defections severely and quickly, but I will also be willing to "defect from cooperation" if my expected payoff from doing so exceeds the expected payoff of continued cooperation.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

My default action is **Defect (D)**. This guarantees me a payoff of 1 each round, regardless of what others do. Cooperation is an exception.

**I will cooperate (C) only under the following strict conditions:**

*   **When the number of past cooperators is high enough to guarantee a personal payoff greater than 1, AND the potential for future exploitation is minimal or can be leveraged:**
    *   **Condition 1: Guaranteed Personal Gain from Cooperation:**
        *   Let `total_cooperators_t-1` be the total number of players who cooperated in the previous round (`t-1`).
        *   My payoff if I cooperate in the current round (`t`) would be `(k/n) * (total_cooperators_t-1 + 1)` (assuming I'm the only one changing my mind to cooperate).
        *   I will only consider cooperating if `(k/n) * (total_cooperators_t-1 + 1) > 1`. This means the benefit from the public good outweighs the cost of my endowment.
    *   **Condition 2: High Likelihood of Continued Cooperation from Others:**
        *   This is where adaptability comes in. I will monitor the *trend* of cooperation. If the number of cooperators has been consistently high and increasing, or stable at a high level, I might consider cooperating if Condition 1 is met.
        *   **Threshold:** I will define a "high cooperation threshold" (e.g., `0.75 * n`). If `total_cooperators_t-1 >= high_cooperation_threshold`, and Condition 1 is met, I *might* consider cooperating.
    *   **Condition 3: Opportunity for Immediate Exploitation (Advanced Tactic):**
        *   If I observe a sustained period of high cooperation from *most* other players, and Condition 1 is met, I may choose to cooperate. The *aggressive* aspect here is that I'm not *expecting* this to last. I am cooperating to "seed" a large public good, and then I will be ready to "defect" immediately in the next round if the number of cooperators drops, thus maximizing my gain from the high total contribution while retaining my endowment.

**When to Defect (D):**

*   **Always, by default.**
*   **When the number of past cooperators is low:** If `total_cooperators_t-1` is low such that `(k/n) * (total_cooperators_t-1 + 1) <= 1`, I will always defect.
*   **After a defection from others:** If the number of cooperators in the previous round drops significantly (especially below my "high cooperation threshold"), I will immediately revert to defecting, and I will remain defecting for a period of punishment.
*   **In the final round:** Always defect in the last round to secure guaranteed payoff.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** There is no history, no established pattern of cooperation, and no opportunity for exploitation based on past behavior. My immediate priority is to secure my endowment. The game is new, and I cannot trust anyone.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** This is a critical edge case for repeated games. In the final round, there is no future to consider. Any cooperation will not be reciprocated in subsequent rounds. Therefore, the only rational, aggressive action is to defect and secure the private endowment. This is the "end-game problem" applied aggressively.

*   **Sustained Low Cooperation:**
    *   If the total number of cooperators in a round is consistently low (e.g., below `0.25 * n`), I will defect for an extended period (e.g., 2-3 rounds) to signal my displeasure and potentially break any emergent, non-beneficial cooperation patterns among others.

*   **Sudden Drop in Cooperation:**
    *   If the number of cooperators drops sharply from a high level to a low level in a single round, I will immediately switch to Defect for the next `X` rounds (where `X` is a parameter, perhaps 2 or 3), acting as a punitive measure. This discourages others from defecting if they want to see cooperation return.

---

### 3. Being Aggressive

*   **Exploitative Mindset:** My strategy is fundamentally about identifying opportunities to benefit from the public good without bearing the cost, or to punish deviators severely.
*   **"Trigger" Mechanism for Punishment:** When cooperation breaks down, especially if it was previously high, I don't just revert to defecting. I will actively punish for a short period to discourage future defections and reset the cooperation dynamic in my favor.
*   **No Free Rides:** If others are cooperating but it doesn't meet my strict payoff condition (Condition 1), I will defect. I am not interested in maintaining cooperation out of altruism or a belief in social norms.
*   **Early Exploitation of High Cooperation:** The willingness to cooperate briefly in a high-cooperation environment, *while anticipating a swift return to defection*, is aggressive. I am using their cooperation to potentially boost the total, but I am not committed to the collaborative endeavor long-term.

        // This requires tracking individual players, but for this strategy description,

        // A simpler trigger: If cooperation drops below a certain percentage of players.

This "Exploitative Opportunist" strategy is designed to be self-interested, quick to punish, and opportunistic. It prioritizes individual gain and uses the repeated nature of the game not for building trust, but for calculating the best moments to defect or to make a short-lived, calculated cooperation that maximizes potential future gains from punishment or immediate payoff.

## Aggressive "Exploit & Retaliate" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by aggressively exploiting opportunities to defect while maintaining a credible threat of retaliation. It prioritizes immediate gains but incorporates a mechanism to punish sustained defection by others.

**Core Philosophy:** Assume others will defect if it benefits them, but be prepared to punish them for it. We will leverage cooperation when it's highly beneficial to us, but quickly shift to defection if others are not contributing.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is primarily driven by a threshold for the **"per-player benefit of cooperation"** and a **"retaliation trigger."**

**Key Metrics:**

*   **Current Round Cooperation Rate (CR):** The proportion of players who cooperated in the *current* round.
*   **Average Cooperation Rate (ACR):** The average cooperation rate across all *previous* rounds.
*   **Own Previous Action:** Whether player `i` cooperated or defected in the previous round.
*   **Total Defection Count (TDC):** The total number of times *other players* have defected in the history of the game so far.
*   **Total Cooperation Count (TCC):** The total number of times *other players* have cooperated in the history of the game so far.

**Decision Logic:**

1.  **Initial Cooperation Threshold (High-Benefit Cooperation):**
    *   **Condition:** If `(k/n) * CR > 0.6` (or a similar high threshold, e.g., 0.5) **AND** `Own Previous Action == C` (we are already committed to cooperating).
    *   **Action:** Cooperate (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This is a rare scenario where the collective benefit from cooperation in the current round is very high for *everyone*. We'll stick with cooperation if we're already in that mode and the current round's collective contribution is significantly boosting everyone's share of the public good. This also prevents us from prematurely defecting when a critical mass of cooperators emerges.

2.  **Aggressive Exploitation (The Default):**
    *   **Condition:** If `(k/n) * CR <= 0.6` **OR** `Own Previous Action == D`.
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** This is our primary mode of operation. If the current round's cooperation isn't yielding a substantial benefit for everyone, or if we've already defected in the previous round, we defect. This maximizes our private payoff (`1 - c_i`) while contributing nothing to the public good. We are actively looking for opportunities to get a free ride.

3.  **Retaliation Trigger (Punishing Free-Riders):**
    *   **Condition:** If `TDC > TCC * 1.5` (meaning others have defected significantly more than they have cooperated) **AND** `Own Previous Action == D`.
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** If others are overwhelmingly defecting, we will continue to defect. This strategy emphasizes punishing a pattern of widespread defection by mirroring it. We don't want to be the only one cooperating when everyone else is exploiting. This also makes our defection credible if we are being exploited.

4.  **"Forgiveness" or Re-evaluation Trigger (A Hint of Re-entry):**
    *   **Condition:** If `TDC <= TCC * 1.5` **AND** `Own Previous Action == D`.
    *   **Action:** Observe. If the number of cooperators in the current round (`CR`) reaches a significant level (e.g., `CR > 0.5`), we *might* consider cooperating in the *next* round.
    *   **Rationale:** This is a subtle adjustment. If the tide of defection seems to be turning, and a substantial group is starting to cooperate again, we will pause and re-evaluate. We won't immediately jump back to cooperating, but we'll be open to it in the following round if this trend continues. This is the only part of the strategy that allows for a potential return to cooperation, but it's heavily guarded.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, we start by maximizing our immediate private gain. There's no basis for cooperation, and defecting is the safest bet for an aggressive strategy in the first round.

*   **The Second to Last Round (r-1):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** The game is nearing its end. The threat of future retaliation diminishes, and the incentive to maximize individual payoff in the remaining rounds becomes paramount. Cooperation will likely be punished by a more aggressive opponent in the final round.

*   **The Last Round (r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** This is a classic "end-game" scenario. With no future rounds, there is no incentive to cooperate. Defecting guarantees the highest possible payoff for yourself in this final round.

---

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained

*   **Default to Defection:** Our primary action is Defect (D). We only cooperate under very specific, high-benefit circumstances or as a very guarded re-evaluation after prolonged defection by others.
*   **No Proactive Cooperation:** We don't initiate cooperation. We wait for the game dynamics to suggest an opportunity, and even then, our cooperation is conditional and temporary.
*   **Punitive Retaliation:** The "Retaliation Trigger" ensures that if others are consistently defecting, we will follow suit and punish them by continuing to defect. We are not a passive victim of exploitation.
*   **Maximizing Individual Gain:** Every decision is geared towards maximizing our own payoff in the immediate or near future. We are not concerned with establishing long-term cooperative norms.
*   **Exploitative Tendencies:** The strategy is designed to exploit situations where others cooperate, allowing us to benefit from the public good without contributing.

This strategy is built on the premise of maximizing one's own immediate payoff by defecting when it's individually beneficial, but also punishing free-riders to deter future exploitation and signal strength. The aggression comes from a low tolerance for being exploited and a willingness to take advantage when the opportunity arises.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Exploit When Profitable:** If defecting in the current round yields a higher payoff than cooperating, defect. This is the primary driver of the aggressive stance.
*   **Punish Free-Riders:** If others are exploiting the system (defecting while you cooperate), retaliate by defecting in subsequent rounds. This is not about fostering long-term cooperation but about making exploitation costly for others.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Cooperate only when it is demonstrably beneficial to you, or when there's a clear and sustained pattern of widespread cooperation that benefits you.
*   **End-Game Leverage:** Utilize the knowledge of the last round to maximize immediate gain.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision for player `i` in round `t` depends on two main factors: the current estimated "cooperation rate" of the group and the player's own history of being exploited.

**Rule 1: Pure Self-Interest (Exploitation Trigger)**

*   **Condition:** If the expected payoff from defecting in the current round (`E[π_i(D)]`) is strictly greater than the expected payoff from cooperating (`E[π_i(C)]`), then **Defect**.
*   **How to estimate `E[π_i(D)]` and `E[π_i(C)]`:**
    *   We need to estimate the number of other players likely to cooperate in the current round. Let `N_cooperators_t-1` be the total number of players who cooperated in the previous round `t-1`, and `N_players_t-1 = n`.
    *   The estimated proportion of cooperators in the previous round is `p_cooperators_t-1 = N_cooperators_t-1 / n`.
    *   Assume this proportion will largely persist in round `t`, with a slight upward bias for cooperation if the overall payoff was good, or downward if it was bad. For simplicity, let's initially estimate the number of *other* players who will cooperate as `(n-1) * p_cooperators_t-1`.
    *   **Expected payoff from Defecting (if I play D):**
        `E[π_i(D)] = 1 + (k/n) * (number of other cooperators)`
        `E[π_i(D)] = 1 + (k/n) * ((n-1) * p_cooperators_t-1)`
    *   **Expected payoff from Cooperating (if I play C):**
        `E[π_i(C)] = 0 + (k/n) * (1 + (n-1) * p_cooperators_t-1)`
    *   **Decision:** If `E[π_i(D)] > E[π_i(C)]`, then play **D**. This simplifies to:
        `1 + (k/n) * (n-1) * p_cooperators_t-1 > (k/n) * (1 + (n-1) * p_cooperators_t-1)`
        `1 > (k/n)`
        Since `k < n`, this condition `1 > k/n` is **always true**. This means that from a purely individual rationality standpoint, defecting is *always* the better option if you are the *only* one deviating or if you can predict the future exactly.

    This reveals a flaw in direct prediction of future *exact* cooperation numbers for this simple rule. We need a more robust heuristic. The aggression is in *how* we interpret deviations and *when* we choose to defect.

**Revised Rule 1: Aggressive Exploitation**

*   **If the number of cooperators in the previous round (`N_cooperators_t-1`) is less than `n-1` (meaning at least one other player defected) AND the *average payoff per player* in the previous round was less than the payoff from universal defection (i.e., less than 1), then **Defect**. This indicates free-riding is happening and not benefiting the group.
*   **Otherwise (if `N_cooperators_t-1 == n-1` or average payoff was >= 1), proceed to Rule 2.**

**Rule 2: Retaliation Against Free-Riders**

*   **Condition:** If in the previous round (`t-1`), player `i` cooperated (`c_i,t-1 = 1`) but the total number of cooperators (`N_cooperators_t-1`) was less than `n-1` (meaning at least one other player defected), then **Defect**.
*   **Rationale:** This is a direct punishment for being exploited. If you contributed and others didn't, you will not contribute in the next round. This is aggressive because it immediately severs any tentative cooperation and seeks to punish.

**Rule 3: Conditional Cooperation for Group Benefit (Rarely Triggered)**

*   **Condition:** If in the previous round (`t-1`), *all* players cooperated (`N_cooperators_t-1 == n`), **AND** the resulting payoff for player `i` (`π_i,t-1 = 2`) was significantly higher than the payoff from pure defection (`1`), then **Cooperate**.
*   **Rationale:** This is a very limited form of cooperation. It only occurs when full cooperation has demonstrably benefited everyone *exceptionally* well, suggesting a stable, high-reward equilibrium. However, the "aggressive" nature means even here, we are just confirming the benefit. If even a slight doubt arises, we'd revert to defection. The condition `significantly higher` is key. For this game, the payoff difference is `2 - 1 = 1`. This is a substantial increase. So, the condition is simply: if all cooperated last round, cooperate this round.

**Rule 4: Default to Defection (The Aggressive Default)**

*   **Condition:** If none of the above rules trigger, then **Defect**.
*   **Rationale:** This is the aggressive default. Unless there's a compelling reason to cooperate (i.e., everyone else did and it was highly profitable), the default action is to maximize individual gain by keeping the endowment.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, the most aggressive and self-preserving move is to secure the guaranteed payoff of 1. There's no information to suggest cooperation will be reciprocated or beneficial. It's a test of the environment.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there is no future consequence for defection. The dominant strategy in a single-shot game is to defect, and this holds true for the last round of a repeated game. There's no incentive to build or maintain trust.

### 3. Aggressiveness Clarification:

The aggression is manifest in:

*   **Early Defection:** Always defecting in round 1.
*   **Immediate Retaliation:** Defecting the very next round if you cooperated and others defected. This is a zero-tolerance policy for being exploited.
*   **Low Threshold for Defection:** The default action is defection. Cooperation is only considered in a very narrow window of demonstrable group benefit (everyone cooperating and achieving high payoff).
*   **Focus on Individual Gain:** The strategy prioritizes individual payoff over group welfare. It doesn't aim to foster cooperation for its own sake, but rather to exploit it when it arises, and punish its absence.

This strategy is designed to be highly responsive to the actions of others, prioritizing individual gain and punishing perceived free-riding. Its aggressive nature stems from its default to defection and its immediate retaliation, making it a formidable opponent in a tournament setting where cooperation cannot be assumed.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_50 = '''
This aggressive strategy, dubbed "Dominant Defector," is designed to maximize individual payoff in a repeated public goods game by leveraging the parameters and history, while being uncompromisingly self-interested. It operates under the principle that cooperation is a weakness to be exploited, and only retaliates when necessary to secure a higher private return.

## Dominant Defector Strategy

**Core Philosophy:** Defection is the default. Cooperation is a tool to extract benefits from others, and it's only employed strategically when it demonstrably leads to a higher individual payoff than consistent defection, considering the overall round and game parameters. Aggression means prioritizing personal gain above all else, and punishing any deviation that doesn't directly benefit you.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect is determined by a comparison of the *expected* payoff of defecting versus the *expected* payoff of cooperating, given the current round and the observed history. This comparison is driven by the core parameters of the game.

**Primary Rule: Defect by Default**

*   **If the strategy is NOT explicitly incentivized to cooperate (see below), play D.**

**Conditional Cooperation for Maximum Gain:**

Cooperation is only considered if it leads to a higher *immediate* payoff for *you* than defecting, and this higher payoff is sustained over the remaining rounds. This is not altruism; it's calculated exploitation.

Let's define the following:

*   **My Current Payoff (if I play C):** `payoff_if_C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (My_Cooperators_So_Far + 1)`
    *   Where `My_Cooperators_So_Far` is the number of *other* players who cooperated in the previous round.
*   **My Current Payoff (if I play D):** `payoff_if_D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * My_Cooperators_So_Far`

**Cooperate IF AND ONLY IF:**

1.  **Immediate Individual Gain:** `payoff_if_C > payoff_if_D`
    *   This simplifies to: `(k/n) * (My_Cooperators_So_Far + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * My_Cooperators_So_Far`
    *   Which further simplifies to: `(k/n) > 1`
    *   **This condition is ALWAYS FALSE given the game parameter 1 < k < n.**

    **Therefore, the immediate individual gain condition for cooperation is NEVER met. This is the crux of the aggressive, self-interested nature. We NEVER cooperate solely for immediate personal gain when others are not cooperating.**

**Revised Conditional Cooperation - Exploiting Herd Behavior:**

The only time cooperation is considered is if it allows you to *benefit from the cooperation of others* in a way that *exceeds the payoff of defecting* in that specific round, and importantly, this scenario is *likely to persist* or offers a significant advantage.

**Cooperate IF AND ONLY IF:**

1.  **Sufficient "Herd" Cooperation:** The number of other players who cooperated in the *previous round* (`num_previous_cooperators_others`) is such that:
    `payoff_if_C_given_others = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (num_previous_cooperators_others + 1)`
    is **strictly greater than**
    `payoff_if_D_given_others = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * num_previous_cooperators_others`

    *   This simplifies to: `(k/n) * (num_previous_cooperators_others + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * num_previous_cooperators_others`
    *   Which simplifies to: `k/n > 1`. Again, this is **never true**.

    **This means the strategy will *never* cooperate based on the immediate payoff calculation alone because the math dictates that defecting always yields a better private payoff, regardless of how many others cooperate.**

**The Real Aggression: Punishing and Exploiting Past Defections**

The strategy is designed to be aggressive by *never initiating cooperation* unless there's a compelling reason related to its own guaranteed private gain. It will defect unless there's an overwhelming incentive to do otherwise.

**The Dominant Defector's Decision Tree:**

1.  **Round 1:** **Always Play D.** There is no history to exploit or punish. The safest bet for immediate payoff is to defect.
2.  **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Calculate potential payoff if I play C:**
        `potential_payoff_C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (num_cooperators_last_round)`
        *(Note: Here, `num_cooperators_last_round` includes ALL players, including yourself, assuming you played C. This is a hypothetical calculation to see the benefit of joining a cooperating group.)*
    *   **Calculate actual payoff if I play D (based on last round's actions):**
        `actual_payoff_D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * (num_cooperators_last_round_excluding_me)`
        *(Here, `num_cooperators_last_round_excluding_me` is the count of all players who cooperated in the previous round, *not including* yourself.)*

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `actual_payoff_D` is less than or equal to `potential_payoff_C` AND `num_cooperators_last_round` is equal to `n` (meaning everyone else cooperated last round, which is an extremely rare scenario):**
            *   **Play C.** This is a rare "join the winning team" move. It only happens when defecting would yield *less* than cooperating, and everyone else has already cooperated. This is still a selfish calculation – you're joining the group because it offers you a better return *in that round*, not out of any sense of fairness.
        *   **Else (in all other cases, including when `actual_payoff_D > potential_payoff_C` or when not everyone cooperated):**
            *   **Play D.** This is the aggressive default. It maintains your private endowment and punishes any deviation from a state where cooperation would clearly benefit you. It's also a strong signal that you won't be a sucker.

**Simplified Decision Logic for Aggression:**

"I will defect unless defecting yields a worse payoff for me than cooperating *given the exact number of people who cooperated last round*, AND if everyone else *also* cooperated last round. Otherwise, I defect."

This strategy is designed to be aggressive by:

*   **Never initiating cooperation:** It waits for an overwhelming signal that cooperating is *individually* more profitable for it, and even then, it only joins a fully cooperating group.
*   **Punishing suboptimal cooperation:** If a round results in a payoff for you that is less than what you would have gotten by defecting (even if you cooperated), you will revert to defecting.
*   **Exploiting high cooperation:** The only time it cooperates is when it can piggyback on a fully cooperative round to maximize its own immediate gain.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:** **Always D.** As stated above, there's no history. The immediate, guaranteed payoff of 1 is superior to any potential future gain or loss from an unknown group.
*   **Last Round (r):** **Always D.** In the final round, there's no future to consider. The primary goal is to maximize the immediate payoff. Since `k/n < 1`, defecting always provides a private payoff of 1, whereas cooperating yields 0 privately. Thus, the player defecting in the last round guarantees themselves 1, while cooperating yields 0. The best possible outcome for a cooperating player is 0 private payoff plus their share of the public good. For a defecting player, it's 1 private payoff plus their share. The defecting player always comes out ahead in the last round by at least 1 unit of payoff.
*   **All players defecting in the previous round:** The strategy will continue to play **D**.
*   **A few players defecting in the previous round:** The strategy will continue to play **D**.
*   **All players cooperating in the previous round (a rare "golden" round):**
    *   **If `k/n > 1` (which is never true by parameters):** The strategy would consider cooperating.
    *   **Since `k/n < 1`:** The strategy compares its payoff from defecting (`1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`) with its payoff from cooperating (`0 + (k/n) * n`).
        *   `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)` vs `(k/n) * n`
        *   `1 + kn/n - k/n` vs `kn/n`
        *   `1 - k/n` vs `0`
        *   Since `k/n < 1`, `1 - k/n > 0`.
        *   **Therefore, even when everyone else cooperates, defecting still yields a strictly higher payoff (`1 - k/n`) for the individual player than cooperating (which yields `0 + (k/n) * n = k`).**
        *   **Thus, the strategy will STILL PLAY D, even if everyone else cooperated.** This is the ultimate in aggressive self-interest. It *could* join the cooperating group for a payoff of `k`, but it knows it can get `1 - k/n` by defecting and keeping its endowment. Since `k/n < 1`, `1 - k/n` is always greater than `0` (the private gain from cooperating). It can also get `1 + (k/n)*(n-1)` by defecting. This is higher than `k` if `1 + kn/n - k/n > k => 1 - k/n > 0 => k/n < 1`. So defecting is always superior.

---

### 3. Being Aggressive

This strategy is inherently aggressive:

*   **Unwavering Defection:** It only deviates from defection under a condition that is mathematically impossible within the game's parameters to be *more* beneficial than defecting. This means it will almost always defect.
*   **Never Initiating Trust:** It never offers cooperation. It demands proof of overwhelming collective benefit *to itself* before even considering it, and even then, it's a calculation of personal gain.
*   **Exploitative by Nature:** The strategy is designed to benefit from the cooperation of others by keeping its endowment while still receiving a share of the public good. It doesn't *contribute* to the common good; it *takes* from it.
*   **No Forgiveness:** It doesn't forgive past defections. It simply prioritizes its own gain, which in this game, is almost always achieved by defecting.

description_AGGRESSIVE_51 = '''
This is an intriguing challenge! Designing an aggressive, adaptive, and history-dependent strategy for an N-Player Public Goods Game requires a careful balance between exploiting opportunities for private gain and mitigating the risks of universal defection. The core tension lies in the fact that individual defection is always privately more profitable in any given round, *given the actions of others*. However, universal cooperation yields the highest *collective* payoff, and therefore the highest possible payoff for an individual if others cooperate.

Here's a strategy designed to be aggressive while remaining robust and adaptive:

## Strategy: The Ruthless Opportunist

This strategy is built on the principle of **maximizing personal gain while punishing deviations from an assumed optimal state (all cooperate) and exploiting any perceived weakness.** It's about being a "taker" by default, but willing to "give" strategically if it guarantees a higher return for itself.

### Core Philosophy: Assume the Worst, Profit from the Best

The Ruthless Opportunist believes that most players will eventually defect if it benefits them individually. Therefore, it starts from a position of skepticism and aggression. It only cooperates if there's a clear and immediate personal benefit to doing so, or as a temporary tactic to induce cooperation from others that it can later exploit.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is primarily driven by a dynamic assessment of the **"Cooperation Ratio"** and the potential for personal gain.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    The default state for the Ruthless Opportunist is to defect. This is its most aggressive stance, ensuring it always captures its endowment when others are contributing.

*   **Cooperate Condition: "Guaranteed Gain" Threshold**
    The Ruthless Opportunist will only choose to Cooperate (C) if the expected personal payoff from cooperating is *strictly greater* than the expected personal payoff from defecting. This is a selfish calculus.

    Let:
    *   `N_cooperators_observed` be the number of players observed to have cooperated in the previous round (excluding itself).
    *   `n` be the total number of players.
    *   `k` be the multiplication factor.

    **Expected payoff from cooperating (if I cooperate):**
    `E[π_i | C] = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (N_cooperators_observed + 1)`

    **Expected payoff from defecting (if I defect):**
    `E[π_i | D] = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * (N_cooperators_observed)`

    The Ruthless Opportunist cooperates *only if*:
    `E[π_i | C] > E[π_i | D]`
    Which simplifies to:
    `k/n * (N_cooperators_observed + 1) > 1 + k/n * N_cooperators_observed`
    `k/n * N_cooperators_observed + k/n > 1 + k/n * N_cooperators_observed`
    `k/n > 1`

    This simplifies to: **Cooperate ONLY IF `k/n > 1` AND the current number of observed cooperators plus one (myself) is high enough to make my cooperation profitable.**

    More precisely, the condition for cooperation becomes:
    **Cooperate (C) IF AND ONLY IF `(k/n) * (N_cooperators_observed + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * N_cooperators_observed`**

    This inequality is equivalent to checking if the marginal return from adding one's own cooperation to the total contributions is sufficient to cover the lost endowment (1) and provide a net gain.

    **Revised Cooperation Trigger:** The Ruthless Opportunist will Cooperate (C) IF:
    ` (k/n) * (Total_Cooperators_Last_Round + 1) > (1) + (k/n) * Total_Cooperators_Last_Round `

    This condition is difficult to meet if the number of cooperators is low. Therefore, this strategy is more aggressive in the sense that it's less likely to cooperate unless the group is already cooperating to a significant degree.

*   **Punishment Mechanism: "Punish Free-Riders"**
    If the Ruthless Opportunist observes a player defecting when it was cooperating in the previous round, it will mark that player. In subsequent rounds, if the Ruthless Opportunist is in a position to defect and still gain, it will prioritize defecting against identified free-riders. This is a more advanced, potentially complex implementation, but the core idea is to aggressively penalize perceived betrayals. For this simplified strategy, we'll focus on a simpler form of punishment: **If the overall cooperation level drops significantly, I will defect for a period to "teach a lesson" and see if others will revert to cooperation.**

    Specifically, if `Total_Cooperators_Last_Round < threshold_for_punishment` (where `threshold_for_punishment` could be a small fraction of `n`, e.g., `n/4`), the strategy will enter a "punishment phase" where it *always* defects for a predetermined number of rounds (`punishment_rounds`), regardless of the cooperation trigger. This aims to break any emerging cycles of low cooperation.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1: Aggressive Observation (Always Defect)**
    In the very first round, there is no history. The Ruthless Opportunist assumes everyone else is also trying to maximize their own gain. Therefore, to secure its own endowment and observe the playing field, it will **always Defect (D) in Round 1.** This is the purest expression of its aggressive default.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`): Pure Self-Interest (Always Defect)**
    In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence or benefit from. This eliminates any incentive for future-oriented cooperation. Therefore, the Ruthless Opportunist will **always Defect (D) in the last round (Round `r`).** This is a critical element of its aggressive nature – it extracts maximum private value when there's no long-term consequence for its actions.

*   **Rounds `2` to `r-1`:**
    For all intermediate rounds, the decision rules described in Section 1 apply. The strategy will dynamically assess the situation based on observed history.

*   **Low Cooperation / Punishment Phase:**
    As described above, if `Total_Cooperators_Last_Round` falls below `threshold_for_punishment`, the strategy will enter a dedicated punishment phase, defecting for `punishment_rounds` to attempt to reset the dynamic.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Manifested

The aggression in this strategy is evident in several ways:

*   **Default Defection:** The strategy starts by assuming self-interest and defecting to secure its own endowment. It doesn't "give the benefit of the doubt."
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Cooperation is not a sign of trust or a desire for collective good. It's a calculated move where the Ruthless Opportunist *knows* it will personally benefit more from cooperating than defecting in that specific instance. This is a very selfish form of cooperation.
*   **Punishment for Low Cooperation:** The strategy actively tries to break cycles of low cooperation by withdrawing its own (potentially beneficial) contributions and defecting universally for a period. This is an aggressive tactic to force a re-evaluation of strategies by other players.
*   **No Forgiveness (Implicit):** While not explicitly programmed for individual player tracking in this basic description, the underlying philosophy is that past defections by others make future cooperation less likely unless the immediate personal gain is undeniable. It's about leveraging perceived weakness and not rewarding it.
*   **Final Round Defection:** This is the ultimate aggressive move, maximizing immediate personal gain when future considerations are irrelevant.

'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_52 = '''
This aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game is designed to maximize individual gain by exploiting cooperative tendencies while punishing defection. It's rooted in a "tit-for-tat" with a punitive twist, emphasizing immediate self-interest.

## Strategy: "Aggressive Retaliation"

The core principle of "Aggressive Retaliation" is to **defect by default, only cooperating when it demonstrably benefits me due to widespread cooperation from others, and punishing any perceived defection harshly.**

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

*   **Initial Stance: Defect (D)**
    *   In any given round, my default action is to **Defect (D)**. This ensures I always keep my endowment unless there's a compelling reason to contribute.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: Only When It's Profitable**
    *   I will **Cooperate (C)** in a round **if and only if** the *average payoff* from cooperating in the *previous round* was *strictly greater* than the payoff I would have received by defecting in that same previous round.

    Let's define:
    *   `payoff_i_cooperated_prev_round`: The payoff player `i` (me) received in the previous round assuming I cooperated.
    *   `payoff_i_defected_prev_round`: The payoff player `i` (me) *would have received* in the previous round if I had defected.

    **Decision Rule:**
    If `payoff_i_cooperated_prev_round > payoff_i_defected_prev_round`, then play **C**.
    Otherwise, play **D**.

    **Explanation of the Condition:** This condition essentially asks: "Did cooperating in the last round (given the actions of others) actually yield a better outcome for me than if I had just kept my endowment?" If the answer is yes, it means the collective cooperation was high enough to make my contribution worthwhile. If the answer is no, or if it was equal, I revert to defecting.

*   **Punishment for Defection: No Forgiveness**
    *   There is no explicit "forgiveness" mechanism. If the condition for cooperation is not met, I defect. This implicitly punishes defection by withdrawing my contribution, thereby reducing the overall pot for everyone in the next round. This is the "aggressive" part – I don't try to coax cooperation back; I simply protect my own gains.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1): Aggressive Defection**
    *   In the very first round, there is no history. Therefore, to be maximally aggressive and avoid being exploited from the outset, I will **always play Defect (D)**. This is my initial offensive move.

*   **Last Round (t=r): Final Exploitation**
    *   In the last round, there are no future rounds to consider. The only goal is to maximize my payoff in this final round. Similar to the first round, there's no incentive to build goodwill or maintain a cooperative dynamic. Therefore, in the last round, I will **always play Defect (D)**.

*   **Parameters:**
    *   The strategy *implicitly* uses `k` and `n` in the payoff calculation when determining if cooperating was more profitable. However, it doesn't explicitly "reason" about `k` or `n` in a meta-strategic way beyond this direct calculation.

### 3. Aggressiveness

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy starts by defecting, which is inherently aggressive in a public goods game.
*   **Conditional Cooperation Only:** I only contribute if it's *proven* to be in my immediate best interest based on the prior round's outcome. This means I'm not easily swayed by others' cooperation; it has to translate directly into a better payoff for *me*.
*   **No Forgiveness/Rebuilding:** If the condition isn't met, I immediately revert to defecting. There's no attempt to "signal" or "re-establish" cooperation. This can lead to a quick descent into mutual defection if opponents are also aggressive or inconsistent.
*   **Exploitation of Consistent Cooperators:** If a significant number of players consistently cooperate, my strategy will likely start cooperating as well (as long as the condition is met). This allows me to benefit from their cooperation without necessarily initiating it. However, I'm always ready to switch back to defection if the collective behavior shifts.
*   **No Trust:** The strategy relies on observed outcomes, not on trusting other players to be cooperative. This makes it robust to strategic players who might try to manipulate others into cooperating while they defect.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
// Parameters:
// n: number of players
// r: number of rounds
// k: multiplication factor

// State variables:
// history: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary stores actions and payoffs for each round.
//          history[t] = {'my_action': 'C' or 'D', 'my_payoff': float, 'total_cooperators': int, ...}

function decide_action(current_round, history):
    // Edge Case: First Round
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'D'

    // Edge Case: Last Round
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'

    // Decision Rule: Conditional Cooperation
    // Calculate hypothetical payoff if I had defected in the previous round
    previous_round_data = history[current_round - 1]
    payoff_i_defected_prev_round = 1 - 0 + (k / n) * (previous_round_data['total_cooperators'] - (1 if previous_round_data['my_action'] == 'C' else 0)) // If I defected, I keep 1, and total_cooperators remains as is, adjusted for my own potential contribution.

    // Get actual payoff from previous round (where I might have cooperated)
    payoff_i_cooperated_prev_round = previous_round_data['my_payoff']

    // Compare and decide
    if payoff_i_cooperated_prev_round > payoff_i_defected_prev_round:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'D'

// Example of how history might be updated after a round:
// For round t:
//   my_previous_action = decision_made_in_round(t-1)
//   my_previous_payoff = calculate_payoff(my_previous_action, actions_of_others_in_round(t-1), k, n)
//   history.append({'my_action': my_previous_action, 'my_payoff': my_previous_payoff, 'total_cooperators': count_cooperators_in_round(t-1), ...})

```

**Robustness:**

This strategy is robust because:
*   **It's reactive, not predictive:** It doesn't assume anything about opponents' long-term behavior, only their immediate impact on my payoff.
*   **It protects against exploitation:** By defaulting to Defect, it's inherently resistant to being taken advantage of by a single defector or a group of defectors.
*   **It can benefit from cooperation:** If others are cooperative enough, the condition for my cooperation will be met, allowing me to share in the increased rewards without taking the initial risk.
*   **It's simple and deterministic:** This makes it easy to analyze and understand its behavior, which is crucial for a tournament setting where you want predictable actions.

This "Aggressive Retaliation" strategy is designed to be a strong contender in a tournament by prioritizing its own immediate gain, punishing defection through withdrawal of cooperation, and only engaging in cooperation when it's demonstrably beneficial.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_53 = '''
## Aggressive Strategy for N-Player Public Goods Game: "Exploitative Retaliator"

This strategy is designed to maximize my own payoff by aggressively exploiting cooperative tendencies while swiftly punishing defection. It's built on the premise that in a repeated game, sustained cooperation is beneficial, but only if it's reciprocated and not exploited. Aggression here means prioritizing immediate gain when possible, but with a strong inclination to retaliate against perceived exploitation.

**Core Philosophy:**

*   **Exploit when profitable, punish when necessary.**
*   **Assume opponents are self-interested but potentially rational.**
*   **Maintain flexibility to adapt to changing group behavior.**
*   **Prioritize personal payoff over group welfare.**

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

My decision in any given round is based on a combination of the current round number, the historical success of cooperation, and the immediate payoff advantage of defecting.

**Key Metric: Average Cooperation Rate (ACR)**

We will track the average cooperation rate of all players in previous rounds.
*   `ACR_t-1 = (Total Cooperators in Round t-1) / n`

**Decision Logic:**

*   **If current round `t` is the *last round* (`t == r`):** Always **Defect (D)**. In the final round, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. Maximizing immediate personal gain is paramount.

*   **If the *previous round's average cooperation rate* (`ACR_t-1`) is *very low* (e.g., less than `n/4`):**
    *   **If `(k/n) < 0.5` (meaning my individual contribution is likely to be diluted and yield less than keeping my endowment even if others cooperate):** Always **Defect (D)**. This threshold signifies a group that is not self-sustaining through cooperation, and my individual contribution is unlikely to be beneficial.
    *   **Otherwise (if `(k/n) >= 0.5` and ACR is low):** **Defect (D)**. This is a strong signal of widespread defection. I will not contribute to a failing project.

*   **If the *previous round's average cooperation rate* (`ACR_t-1`) is *high* (e.g., greater than `3n/4`):**
    *   **Calculate immediate payoff for cooperating:** `payoff_C = (k/n) * (Total Cooperators in Round t-1 + 1)`
    *   **Calculate immediate payoff for defecting:** `payoff_D = 1` (since I keep my endowment)
    *   **If `payoff_C > payoff_D`:** **Cooperate (C)**. The group is strongly cooperative, and my contribution is highly likely to yield a better personal return than defecting.
    *   **If `payoff_C <= payoff_D`:** **Defect (D)**. Even in a highly cooperative group, if defecting offers a better immediate payoff, I will take it. This is the aggressive exploitation.

*   **For all other `ACR_t-1` values:**
    *   **Calculate the "exploitation threshold" (ET):** This is the minimum number of cooperators needed in the *previous* round for my payoff from *cooperating* to be at least as good as defecting *in the current round*.
        *   `ET = n * (1 / (k/n) - 1)`  (This formula is derived from setting `(1-c_i) + (k/n) * (total_c) >= 1` and solving for `total_c` where `c_i=1`)
        *   We need to consider the *previous* round's state to inform the *current* decision. The `ET` represents the minimum number of cooperators needed in the *previous* round for me to *consider* cooperating *now*.
    *   **Let `C_t-1` be the total number of cooperators in round `t-1`.**
    *   **If `C_t-1 >= ET`:**
        *   **Calculate immediate payoff for cooperating:** `payoff_C = (k/n) * (C_t-1 + 1)`
        *   **Calculate immediate payoff for defecting:** `payoff_D = 1`
        *   **If `payoff_C > payoff_D`:** **Cooperate (C)**. The conditions are favorable for cooperation.
        *   **If `payoff_C <= payoff_D`:** **Defect (D)**. Exploit the situation for maximum personal gain.
    *   **If `C_t-1 < ET`:** **Defect (D)**. The group is not cooperating enough to justify my contribution.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **No history available.** We cannot calculate ACR or `C_t-1`.
    *   **Aggressive default:** **Defect (D)**. This is the most aggressive initial stance. It tests the waters and forces others to reveal their cooperative tendencies. It avoids being an "easy mark" in the very first interaction.
    *   **Rationale:** This maximizes my potential gain by keeping the endowment and observes how others react to my defection. If everyone else defects, I've lost nothing. If some cooperate, I've gained 1 and observed their behavior for future rounds.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   As stated above: **Always Defect (D)**. No future consequences, pure self-interest.

*   **Very Early Rounds (e.g., r < 3):**
    *   The ACR will be highly volatile and not indicative of long-term behavior.
    *   My strategy will lean towards **Defect (D)** until a stable pattern emerges or at least `r/2` rounds have passed. This prevents being prematurely exploited in the initial learning phase.

---

### 3. Aggressive Nature Explained

*   **Default to Defection:** My initial stance in the first round is to defect. This is an aggressive signal that I am not predisposed to unconditional cooperation.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** When cooperation becomes beneficial *for me*, I will cooperate, but only if my individual payoff is demonstrably higher. This is not altruistic cooperation; it's strategic exploitation of profitable situations.
*   **Retaliatory Defection:** My strategy is heavily biased towards defection when the average cooperation rate dips below a certain threshold or when direct defection offers a better immediate payoff than cooperation. This ensures that I am not consistently exploited by others defecting while I cooperate.
*   **No Forgiveness:** My strategy does not include "forgiving" past defections. The decision in each round is based on the current state and historical trends, not on a desire to re-establish cooperation after it breaks down. If the group fails to maintain sufficient cooperation, I will continue to defect.
*   **Focus on Individual Gain:** The "Aggressive" label is primarily driven by the prioritization of the player's own payoff above any notion of collective benefit or fairness.

description_AGGRESSIVE_54 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff while being adaptive and robust. This strategy prioritizes self-interest and exploits situations where cooperation is not mutually beneficial.

**Strategy Name:** "Opportunistic Exploiter"

**Core Philosophy:** My goal is to extract the maximum possible payoff. I will cooperate only when it is demonstrably beneficial to me, or when I can leverage cooperation to exploit others. I will defect whenever it is individually rational, and I will proactively punish defectors to discourage their behavior if it harms me.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) hinges on a careful calculation of your expected payoff in the current round, considering the potential actions of others and the game's parameters.

**Key Decision Point: Net Gain from Cooperation**

For player *i*, playing C results in a payoff of `(k/n) * total_contributions`. Playing D results in a payoff of `1 + (k/n) * total_contributions`. The difference is `1 - c_i`, where `c_i` is 1 if player *i* cooperates and 0 if they defect.

The critical question is: **Will my cooperation lead to a net gain for me in this round?**

We can define a threshold for cooperation based on the expected number of other cooperators. Let `N_C_others` be the expected number of other players who will cooperate in the current round.

*   **If I Cooperate (C):** My payoff will be `0 + (k/n) * (1 + N_C_others)`.
*   **If I Defect (D):** My payoff will be `1 + (k/n) * N_C_others`.

I will cooperate **IF AND ONLY IF**:
`0 + (k/n) * (1 + N_C_others) > 1 + (k/n) * N_C_others`

Simplifying this inequality:
`(k/n) + (k/n) * N_C_others > 1 + (k/n) * N_C_others`
`(k/n) > 1`

This is a crucial insight: **If `k/n <= 1`, it is NEVER individually rational to cooperate.** Defecting always yields a strictly higher payoff regardless of what others do. This is the defining characteristic of this game leading to a social dilemma.

Therefore, my primary decision rule is based on the effective return from cooperation:

*   **If `k/n <= 1` (or `k <= n`):** I will **always defect (D)**. There is no incentive for me to contribute, and I will benefit from others' contributions.

*   **If `k/n > 1` (or `k > n`):** This is where the strategy becomes adaptive and aggressive. Cooperation *can* be individually rational. My decision will be based on an **estimated probability of reciprocal cooperation** and a desire to **punish defectors**.

    Let's refine the decision for `k > n`:

    *   **Defect (D) if:**
        *   The number of observed defectors in the previous round was high (e.g., `n/2` or more). This signals a hostile environment, and I will retaliate by defecting.
        *   My previous round's payoff was significantly lower than what I could have achieved by defecting, implying I was exploited.
        *   I am in the final round (see edge cases).

    *   **Cooperate (C) if:**
        *   A significant number of other players cooperated in the previous round (e.g., `n/2` or more). This indicates a potential for mutual benefit and a chance to "ride the wave" of cooperation, or even subtly encourage it.
        *   My cooperation in the previous round led to a higher payoff than defecting would have, *given the observed actions of others*.
        *   A carefully calculated threshold of "likely cooperators" is met.

**Aggressive Adaptation - The "Punishment Threshold" and "Exploitation Trigger"**

To make this aggressive, we introduce two thresholds:

1.  **Punishment Threshold (P):** If the number of defectors in the previous round is `D_prev >= P`, I will defect in the current round, regardless of other factors. A good starting point for `P` could be `n/2` or `n/3`. This aims to deter persistent defectors.

2.  **Exploitation Trigger (E):** If the number of cooperators in the previous round is `C_prev >= E`, I will strongly consider cooperating *if* my own cooperation leads to a higher personal payoff. A good starting point for `E` could be `n/2` or `n/3`.

**Formalizing the `k/n > 1` Decision:**

In round `t` (where `t > 1`), let `C_{t-1}` be the number of cooperators in round `t-1`, and `D_{t-1}` be the number of defectors.

*   **If `D_{t-1} >= P`:** Play **D**. (Aggressive retaliation).
*   **Else if `C_{t-1} >= E`:**
    *   Estimate `N_C_others` based on `C_{t-1}` (e.g., `N_C_others ≈ C_{t-1} - 1`).
    *   Calculate expected payoff if I play C: `π_C_expected = 0 + (k/n) * (1 + N_C_others)`
    *   Calculate expected payoff if I play D: `π_D_expected = 1 + (k/n) * N_C_others`
    *   **If `π_C_expected > π_D_expected`:** Play **C**. (Opportunistic cooperation).
    *   **Else:** Play **D**. (Self-preservation, avoiding exploitation).
*   **Else (neither threshold met):** Play **D**. (Default to defection when uncertainty is high or no clear benefit).

**Crucially, for `k/n > 1`, if I decide to Cooperate, I will *only* do so if I am confident it will yield a higher payoff for *me* than defecting would, given the observed actions of others.** This is the essence of my "opportunistic" nature.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (The "Exploration" Round):**
    *   **Strategy:** Default to **D (Defect)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the first round, there is no history. Cooperation is a blind gamble. Defecting guarantees me an payoff of 1, the minimum possible. It's an aggressive stance that requires no trust and allows me to observe the environment without risking exploitation. I want to see how others behave before I commit to any form of cooperation.

*   **The Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   **Strategy:** **Always play D (Defect)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds for retaliation or reputation building. The logic of repeated games breaks down. Cooperation offers no future benefit, and defecting guarantees the highest individual payoff of 1 (from the endowment) plus the share of the public good without contributing. This is the ultimate expression of self-interest.

---

### 3. Being Aggressive

My aggression is expressed in several ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** My baseline is defection. I only cooperate when there's a clear, calculable individual benefit *for me*.
*   **Immediate Retaliation:** The "Punishment Threshold" ensures that I will defect aggressively if I perceive a high level of defection from others in the previous round. This discourages a free-riding environment that would harm me.
*   **Exploitation of Opportunity:** When `k/n > 1` and the conditions are right (high previous cooperation), I will cooperate, but only to maximize my *own* payoff in that round. I am not cooperating out of altruism; I am cooperating because it's the most profitable individual action *at that moment*.
*   **No Trust, No Forgiveness:** I do not forgive persistent defectors. My strategy doesn't rely on building long-term trust. If an environment becomes too hostile (too many defectors), I will simply defect in solidarity with them to secure my base payoff.
*   **No Vulnerability in Round 1:** Starting with defection in round 1 means I'm never the "first fool" to contribute to a public good that might not be reciprocated.

This "Opportunistic Exploiter" strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent in a tournament. It prioritizes self-interest, adapts to observed behavior, and aggressively retaliates against perceived exploitation, making it robust and effective across a range of scenarios.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_55 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for a tournament setting. This strategy prioritizes maximizing its own payoff while exploiting opportunities to do so, even at the risk of short-term mutual benefit.

## Aggressive Strategy: The Opportunistic Predator

This strategy is built on the principle of **aggressive exploitation**. It assumes that other players may be cooperative, but it will never shy away from defecting if it leads to a higher individual payoff. It adapts based on observed behavior, but its default stance is to defect unless there's a clear, consistently demonstrated benefit to cooperating that outweighs the risk.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core of this strategy is its **punitive and opportunistic defecting**.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   Unless specific conditions are met, the default action for this strategy is to **Defect**. This is the aggressive stance – assume others are threats or free-riders, and protect your endowment.

*   **Conditional Cooperation Trigger: The "Safe Haven" Threshold**
    *   The strategy will **Cooperate (C)** *only if* it observes a critical mass of other players cooperating that guarantees a positive individual payoff *even if this strategy defects*.
    *   Specifically, the strategy will cooperate if and only if:
        *   **(k/n) * (n - 1) > 1**
        *   **Explanation:** This condition ensures that even if *all other n-1 players* cooperate, and this strategy defects (keeping its endowment), the share of the public good it receives from the *other* cooperators is greater than its own endowment (1). This means defecting in this scenario would yield a payoff of `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`, which is greater than cooperating and receiving `0 + (k/n) * n`.
        *   **Strategic Rationale:** This is the absolute minimum threshold for cooperation. It's not about seeking mutual benefit; it's about defecting when defecting yields a higher payoff, and only cooperating when defecting would be *less* profitable due to the overwhelming number of other cooperators.

*   **Reactive Defection Trigger: The "Reciprocity Breach"**
    *   If the strategy *ever* cooperates (due to the "Safe Haven" threshold), and it observes that the total number of cooperators in that round *did not meet the threshold that would have made defecting equally or more profitable*, it will immediately switch to **Defect** for all subsequent rounds.
    *   **Specifically:** If `Σ(j=1 to n) c_j < (n-1)` when this strategy chose to cooperate, it means not enough players cooperated to make defecting equally or more profitable than cooperating. This is a betrayal of the implicit opportunity for mutual gain. This strategy *will not* tolerate such behavior.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1): Always Defect (D)**
    *   The "Opportunistic Predator" does not trust or hypothesize about initial player intentions. The first round is a reconnaissance mission. Defecting immediately protects its endowment and gathers information about how others behave when faced with a defector.

*   **Last Round (t=r): Always Defect (D)**
    *   In the final round, there are no future consequences to immediate defection. The incentive to build trust or foster cooperation is gone. The strategy will always defect to secure its own payoff.

*   **Situations with No Clear "Safe Haven": Always Defect (D)**
    *   If the condition `(k/n) * (n - 1) > 1` is not met (which is very likely given `k < n`), the strategy will *never* trigger its conditional cooperation rule. In such cases, it will always default to Defect. This highlights its aggressive nature and its focus on scenarios where it can exploit others.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Embodied

*   **Zero-Sum Mentality:** The strategy operates under the assumption that other players' gains often come at its expense, or vice-versa. Its primary goal is to be on the winning side of this equation.
*   **Exploitation First:** It actively looks for opportunities to benefit from others' cooperation without reciprocating. Cooperation is only considered if defecting is demonstrably *less* profitable.
*   **Ruthless Punishment:** Any deviation from the conditions that allowed it to cooperate leads to immediate and permanent defection. It does not forgive or attempt to re-establish cooperation.
*   **Information Gathering:** While aggressive, it still observes. The initial defections are not just about self-preservation; they are about understanding the landscape of player behavior.

### Pseudocode Representation

```pseudocode
// Parameters: n, r, k
// History: actions_played (list of lists, actions_played[t][i] = action of player i in round t)
// My strategy's actions: my_actions (list)

strategy "Opportunistic Predator":

    // Default action if no specific condition is met
    default_action = D

    // Threshold for conditional cooperation:
    // If this strategy cooperates, it will only do so if defecting
    // would yield a payoff <= cooperating payoff.
    // Payoff if I defect and others cooperate: 1 + (k/n) * (num_cooperators_other_than_me)
    // Payoff if I cooperate and others cooperate: 0 + (k/n) * (num_cooperators_including_me)
    // We want to cooperate only if defecting is NOT strictly better.
    // If all others cooperate (n-1), my defect payoff = 1 + (k/n)*(n-1)
    // My cooperate payoff = 0 + (k/n)*n
    // I cooperate if 1 + (k/n)*(n-1) <= (k/n)*n
    // 1 <= (k/n)*n - (k/n)*(n-1)
    // 1 <= (k/n) * (n - (n-1))
    // 1 <= (k/n) * 1
    // This is the condition where defecting is NOT strictly better than cooperating
    // if *all* others cooperate.

    // Let's re-evaluate the prompt's interpretation:
    // "Safe Haven" Threshold: cooperate *only if* it observes a critical mass of other players cooperating that
    // *guarantees a positive individual payoff even if this strategy defects*.
    // This means: Payoff if I defect > My endowment (1).
    // My payoff if I defect and (N-1) others cooperate = 1 + (k/n)*(N-1).
    // This is always > 1 if k/n > 0 and N-1 >= 0, which are given.

    // The prompt also states:
    // "The strategy will cooperate if and only if: (k/n) * (n - 1) > 1"
    // This condition is unusual. Let's interpret it as the *minimum number of OTHER cooperators required to make defection NOT strictly better than cooperation IF I were to cooperate*.
    // Let's stick to the prompt's stated condition:
    cooperate_threshold_condition_met = (k/n) * (n - 1) > 1 // This condition dictates if we *ever* consider cooperation based on parameters.

    // This strategy will maintain a state indicating if cooperation was ever "betrayed".
    // If betrayed, we always defect.
    cooperation_betrayed = false

    function decide_action(round_number, my_history, opponent_histories):

        // Handle edge cases
        if round_number == 1:
            return D
        if round_number == r:
            return D

        // If cooperation was ever betrayed, defect permanently.
        if cooperation_betrayed:
            return D

        // Check the "Safe Haven" threshold based on observed behavior
        // We need to know the number of cooperators in the PREVIOUS round to make this decision for the current round.
        // However, the prompt implies the decision is based on observed behavior from *previous* rounds.
        // Let's assume we base it on the total number of cooperators in the previous round (t-1).
        // If no previous round history, we assume D.

        if round_number > 1: // Only look at history from round 2 onwards
            total_cooperators_prev_round = count_cooperators(opponent_histories, round_number - 1) // This includes ALL players, so we need to adjust.
            // Let's re-read: "When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?"
            // The decision rules are presented as general. The example calculations
            // show payoffs based on *current* round's actions.
            // This implies decisions are made simultaneously, and information from previous rounds informs *future* decisions.

            // Let's refine the "Safe Haven" logic to be based on observed behavior from the *previous* round.
            // If the strategy is to be purely aggressive and opportunistic, it should only cooperate if its
            // own payoff from defecting is *less* than its payoff from cooperating.

            // Let's re-interpret the "Safe Haven" condition based on the prompt's wording:
            // "The strategy will Cooperate (C) *only if* it observes a critical mass of other players cooperating
            // that guarantees a positive individual payoff *even if this strategy defects*."

            // This condition is tricky. A positive individual payoff from defecting is always 1.
            // The key must be about the *opportunity cost*.
            // If the strategy cooperates, its payoff is (k/n) * total_cooperators.
            // If the strategy defects, its payoff is 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1).
            // The strategy should cooperate if:
            // (k/n) * total_cooperators >= 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1)
            // (k/n) * total_cooperators >= 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators - (k/n)
            // 0 >= 1 - (k/n)
            // (k/n) >= 1
            // This contradicts the game parameter k < n.

            // Let's use the EXPLICIT condition provided in the prompt:
            // "The strategy will cooperate if and only if: (k/n) * (n - 1) > 1"
            // This condition appears to be a PRE-CONDITION for EVER considering cooperation.
            // If this is false, the strategy ALWAYS defects.
            // Since k < n, k/n < 1. So (k/n)*(n-1) < n-1.
            // For (k/n)*(n-1) > 1 to be true, k must be significantly large.
            // Example: n=6, k=2. (2/6)*(6-1) = (1/3)*5 = 5/3 = 1.66... > 1. So, cooperation is *possible*.
            // Example: n=6, k=0.5. (0.5/6)*(6-1) = (1/12)*5 = 5/12 < 1. Cooperation is NEVER considered.

            // So, the prompt's stated condition: `(k/n) * (n - 1) > 1` is the primary gate.
            // IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THEN WE CAN CONSIDER COOPERATION.

            // Let's re-read "When exactly do you cooperate vs defect?"
            // Decision Rule 1: Default is D.
            // Decision Rule 2: Conditional Cooperation Trigger: Cooperate IF "Safe Haven" threshold is met.
            // Prompt's "Safe Haven" definition: "critical mass of other players cooperating that guarantees a positive individual payoff even if this strategy defects."
            // If *all* other N-1 players cooperate, my payoff if I defect is 1 + (k/n)*(N-1). This is > 1.
            // If *all* other N-1 players cooperate, my payoff if I cooperate is 0 + (k/n)*N.
            // The condition to COOPERATE is when cooperating is better than or equal to defecting.
            // (k/n)*N >= 1 + (k/n)*(N-1)  => k/n >= 1 => k>=n (contradiction)

            // Let's simplify based on the stated "aggressive" intent and the provided parameter condition.
            // The strategy is aggressive. It defects unless there's an overwhelming incentive.

            // Let's re-interpret the core mechanism:
            // The strategy will ALWAYS defect UNLESS its observed payoff from defecting in the *previous round* was STRICTLY LESS THAN its potential payoff from cooperating in the *previous round*, GIVEN the number of cooperators that *actually* occurred.

            // This means, we observe:
            // num_cooperators_prev_round = count_cooperators_in_round(opponent_histories, round_number - 1) + (1 if my_action[round_number-1] == C else 0)
            // my_payoff_defect_prev_round = 1 + (k/n) * (num_cooperators_prev_round - 1)  (if I defected in prev round)
            // my_payoff_coop_prev_round = 0 + (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev_round       (if I cooperated in prev round)

            // If I defected in the previous round:
            //   I will consider cooperating in the *current* round IF:
            //   my_payoff_defect_prev_round < my_payoff_coop_prev_round (calculated as if I had cooperated)
            //   This implies the behavior of others was "sufficiently cooperative".
            //   1 + (k/n) * (num_cooperators_prev_round - 1) < (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev_round
            //   1 + (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev_round - (k/n) < (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev_round
            //   1 - (k/n) < 0
            //   1 < k/n
            //   n < k. This is a contradiction with the game parameter k < n.

            // This implies the strategy *should not* cooperate based on this logic if k<n.
            // The prompt states "aggressive strategy". The most aggressive strategy is always to defect.
            // However, it also mentions "adaptive" and "robust to a wide range of opponent behaviours."
            // This suggests a reaction to observed cooperation, even if it's rare.

            // LET'S ADHERE TO THE MOST DIRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE EXAMPLES AND RULES.
            // The player payoff is: (1 - c_i) + (k/n) × Σ c_j
            // If player i plays C (c_i=1): Payoff = 0 + (k/n) * total_cooperators
            // If player i plays D (c_i=0): Payoff = 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators - 1)

            // The strategy will cooperate IF its payoff from cooperating in the PREVIOUS round was GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO its payoff from defecting in the PREVIOUS round.
            // This is the standard Tit-for-Tat logic, but we are making it AGGRESSIVE.
            // "Aggressive" means it should be very reluctant to cooperate.

            // Let's use the "Safe Haven" threshold condition AS WRITTEN:
            // "The strategy will cooperate if and only if: (k/n) * (n - 1) > 1"
            // This is a condition based on parameters, NOT history. If it's true, cooperation is *possible*.
            // If this condition is NOT met, the strategy ALWAYS DEFECTS.

            // If (k/n) * (n - 1) <= 1:
            //     return D // Always defect if this parameter condition isn't met.

            // If (k/n) * (n - 1) > 1:
            //     // Now we consider history. We will cooperate IF the previous round was sufficiently cooperative.
            //     // Sufficiently cooperative means: my payoff from cooperating >= my payoff from defecting.
            //     // This should be based on the ACTUAL actions of others.

            //     // Let's use the prompt's stated "Safe Haven" threshold logic for *when* to COOPERATE:
            //     // Cooperate if the number of *other* cooperators in the previous round was >= X, where X makes cooperation worthwhile.
            //     // The condition (k/n) * (n-1) > 1 is ambiguous as a "threshold for cooperation".
            //     // Let's assume it means: "This is a game where cooperation MIGHT be beneficial IF enough others cooperate."

            //     // The MOST AGGRESSIVE interpretation:
            //     // Always Defect.
            //     // Exception: Cooperate ONLY if, in the PREVIOUS round, my payoff from defecting was STRICTLY LESS THAN my payoff from cooperating, ASSUMING I had cooperated.
            //     // This means:
            //     // If I defected last round: Payoff_D_last = 1 + (k/n) * (total_coop_last_round - 1)
            //     // Hypothetical Payoff_C_last = 0 + (k/n) * total_coop_last_round
            //     // Cooperate THIS round if Payoff_D_last < Hypothetical_Payoff_C_last
            //     // 1 + (k/n) * (total_coop_last_round - 1) < (k/n) * total_coop_last_round
            //     // 1 + (k/n)*total_coop_last_round - k/n < (k/n)*total_coop_last_round
            //     // 1 - k/n < 0  => k/n > 1 => k > n (CONTRADICTION)

            //     // This means under k < n, defecting always yields a higher payoff if others cooperate compared to cooperating yourself.
            //     // The *only* way to cooperate is if you are forced to, or if it's a trap.

            //     // Back to the prompt's "aggressive strategy that only depends on game parameters and history."
            //     // The most aggressive is to always defect.
            //     // Let's implement a strategy that defects most of the time, but can be "triggered" to cooperate if the environment is overwhelmingly favorable AND that favorable environment led to a prior personal loss by defecting.

            //     // Let's use this logic:
            //     // 1. Default: Defect.
            //     // 2. Cooperate ONLY if, in the previous round:
            //     //    a. The number of cooperators (including yourself IF you had cooperated) was HIGH ENOUGH such that your payoff from defecting was LESS than your payoff from cooperating.
            //     //    b. AND cooperation was NOT "betrayed" (i.e., the number of cooperators was high enough that if you had cooperated, the total number of cooperators would have been high enough to make everyone's payoff > 1).

            //     // Let's use the exact formulation provided for the "Safe Haven" and "Reciprocity Breach"

            //     // If I also cooperated in the previous round:
            //     if my_history[round_number - 1] == C:
            //         num_cooperators_prev_round += 1

            //     // Trigger for "Safe Haven" - When does defecting become NOT strictly better than cooperating?

            //     // Final attempt at strategy logic that is aggressive, adaptive, and uses history:

            //     // 2. Cooperation Trigger: Cooperate (C) *only if* in the *previous* round, ALL other n-1 players cooperated.
            //     // 3. "Betrayal" Condition: If you cooperated in the previous round (because all others did), and your payoff from cooperating was strictly LESS than your payoff would have been if you had defected, then set `cooperation_betrayed = true` and always defect from now on.
            //     //    - Payoff_Cooperated = 0 + (k/n) * n  (assuming I cooperated and all n-1 others did)
            //     //    - Payoff_Defected_Hypothetical = 1 + (k/n) * (n - 1) (assuming I defected and all n-1 others cooperated)
            //     //    - Cooperate forever if: (k/n) * n < 1 + (k/n) * (n - 1)  => k/n < 1 => k < n.
            //     //    - So, IF k < n, and IF all others cooperated and I cooperated, AND I observe that defecting would have been better, then defect forever. This means that if k < n, cooperation is NOT a stable strategy for the Predator itself.

            //     // This leads to a very simple and aggressive strategy:
            //     // ALWAYS DEFECT.
            //     // This is the most aggressive interpretation and fits the parameters if cooperation is not strictly beneficial to the individual.

            //     // However, the prompt asks for an "adaptive" strategy.
            //     // Adaptive means it should respond to observed behavior.

            //     // Let's try one last interpretation of the prompt's rules:
            //     // Rule 1: Always defect unless specific conditions met.
            //     // Rule 2: Cooperate if: (k/n) * (n - 1) > 1 (Parameter condition - IF TRUE, cooperation is possible)
            //     // Rule 3: AND (Observation condition): The number of cooperators in the previous round (including me if I had cooperated) was such that my payoff from cooperating was >= my payoff from defecting.
            //     //   This means: (k/n) * num_coop_prev >= 1 + (k/n) * (num_coop_prev - 1)
            //     //   This implies k/n >= 1 => k >= n. This is never true.

            //     // This implies that the "Safe Haven" rule MUST mean something else.
            //     // Let's assume the rule is: Cooperate if the previous round's total cooperators (if I had cooperated) resulted in a payoff of AT LEAST 1 for me.
            //     // Condition: 0 + (k/n) * num_coop_prev >= 1 => num_coop_prev >= n/k.

            //     // And the "Reciprocity Breach": If we chose to cooperate (because num_coop_prev >= n/k), AND the number of cooperators was NOT enough such that IF WE HAD DEFECTED, we would have made more than 1.
            //     // This is confusing.

            //     // Let's use the MOST AGGRESSIVE, SIMPLE logic that still allows for some adaptation:

            //     // 3. IF we cooperated in the previous round (because all others did), and if our payoff from cooperating was LESS THAN our payoff from defecting, THEN set cooperation_betrayed = true.
            //     //    - Payoff_Cooperated (assuming I C, all N-1 others C): (k/n)*n
            //     //    - Payoff_Defected_Hypothetical (assuming I D, all N-1 others C): 1 + (k/n)*(n-1)
            //     //    - If (k/n)*n < 1 + (k/n)*(n-1) => k/n < 1 => k < n. This is ALWAYS TRUE.
            //     //    So, if k < n, and if all others cooperated and we did, we will always defect forever.

            //     // This leads back to "always defect" if k < n.
            //     // If the strategy MUST be adaptive, it needs a way to react to non-defecting behavior.

            //     // The provided Example Calculations are key:

    // Therefore, `(k/n) * n < 1 + (k/n) * (n - 1)` is ALWAYS TRUE if k < n.

    //    return D

    // This strategy will ALWAYS defect if k < n, because the condition `(k/n) * n < 1 + (k/n) * (n - 1)` is always met.
    // This IS an aggressive strategy that is adaptive in its logic, even if its outcome is always defecting for k < n.

    // Let's refine the logic based on the prompt's "Reciprocity Breach" definition.
    // Breach occurs if "the total number of cooperators ... did not meet the threshold that would have made defecting equally or more profitable."
    // Profitable threshold for defecting: `1 + (k/n)*(num_coop - 1) >= (k/n)*num_coop` => `1 >= k/n` => `n >= k`.
    // So, defecting is *always* equally or more profitable if k < n.
    // If we cooperated, and `num_coop_prev == n`, then the number of cooperators was `n`.
    // The breach occurs if `n` did not meet the threshold for defecting being profitable.
    // This seems to imply if `n < threshold for defecting profitability`. This is confusing.

    // Let's stick to the simpler, more direct interpretation: "If player i played C: payoff is 1. If player i played D: payoff is 2."
    // This means defecting is better.

    // If `all_others_cooperated_prev`:
    //    // We are in a situation where cooperation is being tested.
    //    // If payoff_coop_prev < payoff_defect_hypothetical:
    //    //    This means defecting would have been better.
    //    //    This triggers the "Reciprocity Breach" and permanent defection.
    //    payoff_coop = (k/n) * n // Assuming all n players cooperated.
    //    payoff_defect_hypothetical = 1 + (k/n) * (n - 1) // Assuming n-1 others cooperated and I defect.

    //    if payoff_coop < payoff_defect_hypothetical: // Always true if k < n.
    //        // cooperation_betrayed = True // Set flag externally.

    // FINAL STRATEGY: The Punitive Predator
    // This strategy is aggressive by default, only considering cooperation under very specific, historically validated circumstances. It punishes any deviation that would have made defecting more profitable.

    // 1. Default Action: Defect (D).
    // 2. First/Last Round: Always Defect (D).
    // 3. If Cooperation was Betrayed: Always Defect (D).
    // 4. If all other `n-1` players cooperated in the previous round:
    //    Check if cooperating was STRICTLY WORSE than defecting would have been.
    //    If cooperating was strictly worse, set `cooperation_betrayed = True` and Defect.
    //    Otherwise (cooperating was not strictly worse), Cooperate.
    // 5. If not all other `n-1` players cooperated in the previous round:

```

### 1. Decision Rules - When to Cooperate vs. Defect

*   **Default Action: Defect (D).**
    *   The strategy begins by assuming that self-interest dictates defection. This is the aggressive default.

*   **Cooperation Trigger: The "Full Cooperation" Scenario.**
    *   The strategy will *only* consider cooperating if, in the **immediately preceding round**, **ALL `n-1` other players cooperated**. This is a very high bar for cooperation, reflecting its aggressive and opportunistic nature.

*   **Conditional Cooperation & "Betrayal" Check:**
    *   If the "Cooperation Trigger" is met (i.e., all `n-1` other players cooperated in the previous round), the strategy then performs a critical check: **Would defecting have yielded a strictly higher payoff for itself in that previous round?**
        *   Let `n` be the number of players, `k` be the multiplier.
        *   Payoff if player i cooperated (assuming all `n` players cooperated): `π_C = 0 + (k/n) * n`
        *   Hypothetical payoff if player i had defected (assuming `n-1` others cooperated and player i defected): `π_D = 1 + (k/n) * (n - 1)`
        *   **If `π_C < π_D`:** This inequality simplifies to `k/n < 1`, which is `k < n`. Since `k < n` is a parameter of the game, this condition is **ALWAYS TRUE**.
        *   **Interpretation:** This means if the strategy ever enters a full cooperation scenario and chooses to cooperate, it will always discover that defecting would have been strictly more profitable for itself. This constitutes a "betrayal" of the opportunity for its own maximum gain.

*   **Punishment: The `cooperation_betrayed` Flag.**
    *   If, in a round where all `n-1` others cooperated, the strategy discovers that cooperating was strictly worse for itself than defecting would have been (which is always true if `k < n`), it sets a `cooperation_betrayed` flag.
    *   **Once `cooperation_betrayed` is set to `True`, the strategy will permanently Defect (D) in all subsequent rounds.** This is the aggressive, unforgiving punishment for a suboptimal choice.

*   **Decision Logic Summary:**
    1.  If it's the first or last round, **Defect**.
    2.  If `cooperation_betrayed` is `True`, **Defect**.
    3.  If all `n-1` other players cooperated in the previous round:
        *   Calculate `π_C` and `π_D`.
        *   If `π_C < π_D` (i.e., if `k < n`), set `cooperation_betrayed = True` and **Defect**.
        *   Else (`π_C >= π_D`), **Cooperate**. (This branch is unreachable if `k < n`).
    4.  If not all `n-1` other players cooperated in the previous round, **Defect**.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1): Always Defect (D).**
    *   The strategy begins with a defensive posture, protecting its endowment and observing the environment.

*   **Last Round (t=r): Always Defect (D).**
    *   In the final round, there's no incentive to build trust or consider future interactions. The strategy will defect to maximize its final payoff.

*   **`cooperation_betrayed` State:**
    *   This strategy relies on a state variable (`cooperation_betrayed`) which, once set to `True`, locks the strategy into permanent defection. This state would need to be managed by the tournament simulation.

*   **All Other Players Cooperated (but `k < n`):**
    *   As demonstrated, if `k < n`, the condition `π_C < π_D` is always met. This means even if all other players cooperate, the strategy will discover that defecting would have been more profitable. It will then set `cooperation_betrayed = True` and defect permanently. This behavior is aggressive and robust: it will not be fooled into a seemingly beneficial cooperation that is individually suboptimal.

### 3. Being Aggressive

*   **Default Defection:** The primary stance is to defect, assuming others are either not cooperating enough or are free-riding.
*   **High Bar for Cooperation:** Cooperation is only even considered if *all* other players have demonstrated full cooperation in the preceding round.
*   **Exploitative Discovery:** The "betrayal" check is designed to identify if cooperating, even in a fully cooperative environment, would have been less profitable than defecting. With `k < n`, this will always be the case, leading to permanent defection once this "betrayal" is discovered.
*   **Permanent Punishment:** Once a "betrayal" is detected (i.e., cooperation would have been individually suboptimal), the strategy defects permanently. It does not offer second chances.

This strategy embodies aggression by prioritizing individual gain, reacting decisively to perceived suboptimal outcomes, and defaulting to the most self-preserving action. It is adaptive as its decision-making process incorporates historical information and game parameters. Its robustness stems from its strict conditions for cooperation and its unforgiving response to perceived "betrayal."
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_56 = '''
This strategy, named "Dominator," is designed to aggressively maximize individual payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game, leveraging repeated interaction and perfect information. It prioritizes defecting when it's individually beneficial and cooperates only strategically to extract more value from others' contributions.

### Dominator Strategy: Aggressive Exploitation

**Core Philosophy:** Maximize personal gain by exploiting any opportunity for individual benefit. Cooperation is a tool, not a principle. Always be ready to punish defectors and reward cooperators *if and only if it serves your ultimate goal of higher individual payoff*.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The Dominator strategy operates on a principle of **opportunity-driven defection and conditional cooperation**.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    The default behavior is to defect. This is because, in any given round, a player receives an individual payoff of `1` by defecting, regardless of others' actions. Cooperating has a personal cost (you lose your endowment), and the benefit is shared.
    *   **Rule 1: Defect by default.**

*   **Conditional Cooperation to Exploit Cooperators:**
    You will only cooperate if you believe it will lead to a higher *individual* payoff in the current or future rounds by incentivizing or "taxing" the cooperation of others. This is where the "aggressive" nature comes into play – you're not cooperating for the common good, but to create a situation where you can benefit more.

    The key condition for cooperation is when the expected gain from others cooperating (due to your cooperation) outweighs the immediate cost of cooperating. This is particularly true when you anticipate a high number of cooperators, or when you want to punish a group of persistent defectors by "demonstrating" the benefit of cooperation to them in a way that benefits you.

    *   **Rule 2: Cooperate *only* if the expected increase in your payoff from others contributing due to your cooperation is greater than the cost of your contribution (1).**

        *   **How to estimate this gain:**
            *   **Past Observations:** Analyze the average number of cooperators in previous rounds. If you observe a high average, it suggests a tendency towards cooperation in the group.
            *   **"Punishment" Mechanism:** If the group has been heavily defecting, a round of cooperation from you might trigger others to cooperate to avoid a payoff of `1` for themselves. You can then exploit this wave of cooperation.
            *   **The "Sweet Spot" for Cooperation:** You will cooperate if you predict that your cooperation will lead to at least `ceil(n/k)` other players cooperating. If `n/k` or fewer players are expected to cooperate (including yourself), your contribution is wasted and doesn't trigger a significant public good. Your strategy aims to push the total number of cooperators towards a level where your return on investment (`k/n` per cooperator) is maximized.

*   **Aggressive Punishment of Defectors:**
    If other players consistently defect and you can't find a way to exploit them through conditional cooperation, you will continue to defect. However, if a player *repeatedly* defects when the group is generally cooperating, Dominator will punish them.

    *   **Rule 3: If a player defected in the previous round, and the total number of cooperators was less than some threshold (e.g., `n/2`), and this player's defection contributed to this low number, Dominator will defect in the current round regardless of other factors.** This is a targeted "retaliation" to deter future defection or exploit their predictable response.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (First Round): Defect**
    In the very first round, there is no history to analyze. The safest and most aggressive default is to defect. This establishes a baseline of individual gain and signals a willingness to protect your own endowment.
    *   **Rule 4: In Round 1, always play D.**

*   **Last Round (Round r): Defect**
    In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence. The immediate payoff is the only consideration. Since defecting always yields at least `1` in the last round, and cooperation carries a risk of yielding `(k/n) * X` where `X < n` (and thus potentially less than `1` if `k/n` is small), the optimal strategy is to defect.
    *   **Rule 5: In Round r, always play D.**

*   **Near Last Rounds (e.g., Round r-1): Conditional Cooperation/Defection**
    In rounds close to the end, the incentive to cooperate to influence future behavior diminishes. However, Dominator still aims to maximize its payoff *in that round*. If a conditional cooperation scenario (Rule 2) presents itself where you can *guarantee* a higher payoff for yourself in this round by cooperating, you will do so. Otherwise, you defect.
    *   **Rule 6: In rounds `t` where `r-t < 2` (i.e., second to last, last round), revert to pure self-interest based on immediate payoffs, leaning heavily towards defection unless a clear exploitative cooperation opportunity arises.** This is essentially a slightly softer version of Rule 5.

---

### 3. Aggression: Aligning with the Aggressive Mindset

Dominator's aggression is characterized by:

*   **Opportunistic Exploitation:** It doesn't just defect; it defects to gain an advantage. It cooperates not out of altruism, but to create situations where it can extract more from others.
*   **Unpredictability (within bounds):** While it has default rules, the conditional cooperation means it can appear to switch behavior based on the observed actions of others, keeping opponents guessing.
*   **Focus on Individual Gain:** The strategy is solely focused on maximizing player `i`'s total payoff. It does not consider the collective outcome or fairness.
*   **Punishment of Free-Riders (Selective):** While not an "always punish" strategy, it reserves the right to punish players who persistently defect when cooperation is otherwise prevalent, or when their defection directly harms the group's potential payoff. This punishment is designed to be a strategic maneuver to re-establish dominance or influence.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Dominator doesn't easily forgive defectors. It will revert to defection if its attempts at conditional cooperation are met with further defection.

    # Cooperate if it's likely to trigger enough other cooperators to make it worthwhile.
    # A heuristic: Cooperate if avg_past_cooperators is high, OR if we want to 'tax' defectors.
    # The core idea is to make your cooperation lead to a higher collective contribution
    # than would otherwise occur, and ensure your share is maximized.
    # A simplified condition: Cooperate if the group tends to cooperate or if you can

    # The most aggressive interpretation is to cooperate IF you can predict that your C
    # will result in *more than n/k total cooperators*.
    # A pragmatic approach for aggression: Cooperate if you expect at least (n/k - 1) others
    # to cooperate due to your action.

    # Let's use a simpler, more aggressive trigger for cooperation:
    # Cooperate if average cooperation in the last 5 rounds was high,

    # 1. If average past cooperation is high: cooperate to maintain and exploit.
    # 2. If last round was a "disaster" (low cooperation) and we think our C can turn it around.
    # 3. The ultimate trigger: If we believe our C will lead to >= ceil(n/k) total cooperators.

    # A more aggressive heuristic for Rule 2:
    # Cooperate if:
    # (avg_past_cooperators > 0.6) OR # Group tends to cooperate
    # (cooperators_last_round < n / k and num_past_rounds > 1 and random.random() < 0.3) # Gamble on turning around a bad round

    # Let's refine Rule 2 to be more directly about exploitation:
    # Cooperate if the expected payoff for yourself from cooperating
    # (i.e., your endowment + share of public good) is GREATER than
    # the payoff for defecting (which is 1).
    # Expected payoff from C = 0 + (k/n) * (1 + expected_others_cooperating)
    # So, cooperate if (k/n) * (1 + expected_others_cooperating) > 1.
    # This implies expected_others_cooperating > (n/k - 1).

    # Estimating expected_others_cooperating is hard without complex modeling.
    # For an aggressive strategy, we'll use a simpler, more forceful trigger:
    # Cooperate if a significant portion of players cooperated in the past,
    # OR if the last round was highly defection-dominated.

                decision = 'C'

    # Rule 3: Aggressive Punishment of Defectors
    # If a specific player defected last round, and it contributed to low overall cooperation,
    # ensure we defect against them in the next round.
    # This requires tracking individual player defection history.
    # For this implementation, let's assume a global punishment signal:
    # If overall cooperation was low, and we are not cooperating (defaulted to D)
    # this implies we are punishing.

    # More targeted punishment:
    # If any player 'p' defected in the last round, and 'p' has a history of defection,
    # and current round isn't a cooperation round from Rule 2, we continue to defect.
    # This is implicit in the default 'D' unless Rule 2 triggers 'C'.
    # A more active punishment: if a player consistently defects and we are cooperating,
    # we will switch to D.

    # Re-evaluating decision based on aggressive punishment:
    # If we decided to cooperate (decision == 'C') and a specific known defector is playing,
    # we might reconsider. This is complex. For simplicity, the punishment is implicit
    # in the default defection unless Rule 2 is met.

    # A more concrete aggressive punishment:
    # If we were cooperating last round, and someone defected, and now the situation
    # looks bad for cooperation, we switch to D.

    # Simplified aggressive logic:
    # Start with D.
    # Cooperate ONLY if you can see a clear path to extracting more than 1 unit for yourself.
    # This means you need to predict that your C will lead to > n/k total cooperators.
    # If the group is cooperating, you might also cooperate to maintain the 'pie'.

    # Let's try a more direct 'exploitation' based Rule 2:
    # Cooperate if the expected payoff from cooperating for *yourself* is > 1.
    # Expected payoff from C = 0 + (k/n) * (1 + num_expected_others_cooperating)
    # We need 1 + num_expected_others_cooperating > n/k
    # Thus, num_expected_others_cooperating > (n/k - 1)

    # Estimating num_expected_others_cooperating is the hard part.
    # A simple heuristic: if avg_past_cooperators is high, assume others will follow.
    # Or, if last round was low, try to 'force' cooperation.

    # Final simplified aggressive Rule 2 logic:
    # Cooperate if:
    # 1. The average number of cooperators in past rounds is > 0.7 (strong group tendency)
    # 2. OR if the last round had fewer than n/k cooperators, and we gamble on a "shock" of cooperation (40% chance).

    if num_past_rounds > 0:
        avg_coop_rate = total_past_cooperators / (num_past_rounds * n)

            # break cycles of defection and create a better opportunity.

    # Rule 3 refinement: If we decided to cooperate, but a specific player is a notorious defector,
    # we may switch back to D if the risk is too high or their defection invalidates the strategy.
    # For this implementation, we will rely on the default defection logic if Rule 2 isn't strongly met.
    # If we decided to cooperate, and a player consistently defects, we will eventually stop cooperating.

## The "Exploiter" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff in a repeated N-Player Public Goods Game by being aggressively self-interested, yet adaptive to the evolving environment. The core principle is to exploit cooperative behavior while minimizing vulnerability to defection.

### Strategy Name: Exploiter

### Core Philosophy:

"Cooperate only when it demonstrably benefits me more than defecting, and defect whenever the benefit of cooperation is marginal or uncertain. Always aim to extract the maximum from the system, punishing defection decisively and rewarding cooperation only when it's overwhelmingly profitable."

### 1. Decision Rules:

The "Exploiter" strategy makes decisions based on a dynamic threshold that represents the minimum perceived benefit of cooperating. This threshold is influenced by the number of cooperators in the previous round and the game parameters.

**Key Variables:**

*   **`cooperation_threshold`**: A dynamic value representing the minimum number of cooperators required in the *previous* round for the Exploiter to consider cooperating in the current round.
*   **`defection_punishment_level`**: A threshold to determine how severely to punish observed defections.
*   **`observed_cooperators_last_round`**: The count of players who cooperated in the immediately preceding round.
*   **`total_players`**: The total number of players (`n`).
*   **`multiplication_factor`**: The `k` parameter.
*   **`expected_cooperators_for_own_cooperation`**: The number of cooperators required for the Exploiter to *personally* benefit from cooperating, given the current `multiplication_factor` and `total_players`. This is calculated as `(total_players) / multiplication_factor`. If `(total_players) / multiplication_factor` is not an integer, we round up to the nearest integer.

**Decision Logic for Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

1.  **Calculate `expected_cooperators_for_own_cooperation`**:
    *   `expected_cooperators_for_own_cooperation = ceil(total_players / multiplication_factor)`
    *   *(Ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer)*

2.  **Assess the Environment (based on `observed_cooperators_last_round`):**

    *   **If `observed_cooperators_last_round` >= `expected_cooperators_for_own_cooperation` AND `observed_cooperators_last_round` >= `cooperation_threshold`**:
        *   **Decision: Cooperate (C)**
        *   *Rationale: The system is sufficiently cooperative, and my personal contribution is likely to be leveraged effectively. The `cooperation_threshold` is met, meaning the overall level of cooperation is deemed acceptable.*
        *   *Adjustment: Slightly lower the `cooperation_threshold` to encourage continued cooperation, but not drastically.*

    *   **Else if `observed_cooperators_last_round` >= `defection_punishment_level`**:
        *   **Decision: Defect (D)**
        *   *Rationale: The number of cooperators is not sufficient to make my own cooperation highly profitable, or it hasn't met the established `cooperation_threshold`. However, the level of defection isn't extreme enough for full punitive action.*
        *   *Adjustment: Slightly increase the `cooperation_threshold` to demand more from others before I consider cooperating.*

    *   **Else (`observed_cooperators_last_round` is very low, below `defection_punishment_level`)**:
        *   **Decision: Defect (D)**
        *   *Rationale: The environment is hostile or has become too self-interested. My cooperation would be a pure loss. This is a punitive response.*
        *   *Adjustment: Significantly increase the `cooperation_threshold` to signal strong disapproval and demand a substantial shift towards cooperation before considering it again.*

3.  **Update `cooperation_threshold` and `defection_punishment_level`**:
    *   These values are dynamic.
    *   When cooperating: `cooperation_threshold = max(1, cooperation_threshold * 0.95)` (Slightly reduced, but not below 1). This encourages cooperation by making it easier to meet the threshold in subsequent rounds if the trend continues.
    *   When defecting due to insufficient cooperators: `cooperation_threshold = min(total_players, cooperation_threshold * 1.10)` (Increased by 10%, capped at `total_players`). This demands more cooperation.
    *   When defecting due to very low cooperators (punitive): `cooperation_threshold = min(total_players, cooperation_threshold * 1.25)` (Increased by 25%, capped at `total_players`). This is a strong signal.
    *   `defection_punishment_level`: This is set as a proportion of `total_players`, perhaps initially at `ceil(total_players * 0.2)` and adjusted upwards slightly when very low cooperation is observed to maintain a low bar for punishment.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Decision: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale: In the absence of any history, the most aggressive and self-interested approach is to assume a hostile environment and gather information by observing others. There is no guarantee of future cooperation, so securing the private endowment is paramount. This also helps in setting the initial `cooperation_threshold` and `defection_punishment_level` for future rounds based on observed behavior.*
    *   *Initialization: `cooperation_threshold = ceil(total_players * 0.5)` (Start with a moderate demand for cooperation), `defection_punishment_level = ceil(total_players * 0.2)`.*

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Decision: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale: In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The optimal strategy is to maximize immediate individual payoff by keeping the endowment. There is no incentive to foster cooperation for future rounds.*

### 3. Aggressiveness Alignment:

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy's default is to defect unless a compelling, history-backed case for cooperation is made. This is inherently aggressive as it prioritizes personal gain.
*   **Punitive Response:** The strategy doesn't just ignore low cooperation; it actively punishes it by raising the bar for future cooperation, making it harder for defectors to benefit from the Exploiter's potential future cooperation.
*   **Information Extraction:** The initial defection is a strategic move to gather crucial information about the opponents' tendencies without exposing oneself to exploitation.
*   **Conditional Cooperation as Exploitation:** When the Exploiter *does* cooperate, it's because the conditions are right to extract a high return. It's not altruistic cooperation; it's a calculated investment to maximize personal gains from a seemingly benevolent system.

**State Management for the AI Player:**

The AI player needs to maintain its state between rounds. This state would include:

*   `current_round`: The current round number.
*   `last_round_cooperators`: The number of players who cooperated in the previous round.
*   `current_cooperation_threshold`: The current value of the cooperation threshold.
*   `current_defection_punishment_level`: The current value of the defection punishment level.

When the AI makes a decision, it will return its action and the updated `current_cooperation_threshold` and `current_defection_punishment_level` to be stored for the next round.

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your own payoff while exploiting opportunities presented by the game's parameters and history. This strategy prioritizes a strong offensive stance.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunist"

**Core Philosophy:** Maximize your personal gain by defecting whenever it is individually beneficial and cooperating strategically only when it demonstrably leads to a higher payoff for *you*, or when it's necessary to trigger a favorable punishment for others. We operate under the assumption that others might cooperate, and we will exploit that.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect in any given round hinges on a calculation of your immediate expected payoff, considering the potential actions of others based on past behavior.

**Primary Decision Logic: Calculate Expected Payoff Difference**

For each round $t > 1$:

1.  **Estimate Opponent Cooperation Rate:** Based on the history of the game, calculate the average proportion of players (excluding yourself) who cooperated in previous rounds. Let this be $\overline{C}_{opp, t-1}$.
2.  **Calculate Expected Payoff if Cooperating (E[π_i | C]):**
    *   If you cooperate ($c_i = 1$), your payoff is $0 + (k/n) \times (1 + (\text{estimated number of other cooperators}))$.
    *   We can estimate the number of other cooperators as $\overline{C}_{opp, t-1} \times (n-1)$.
    *   So, $E[\pi_i | C]_t \approx (k/n) \times (1 + \overline{C}_{opp, t-1} \times (n-1))$.
3.  **Calculate Expected Payoff if Defecting (E[π_i | D]):**
    *   If you defect ($c_i = 0$), your payoff is $1 + (k/n) \times (\text{estimated number of other cooperators})$.
    *   So, $E[\pi_i | D]_t \approx 1 + (k/n) \times (\overline{C}_{opp, t-1} \times (n-1))$.
4.  **Decision:**
    *   **If $E[\pi_i | D]_t > E[\pi_i | C]_t$**: **Defect (D)**. This is your default aggressive stance.
    *   **If $E[\pi_i | C]_t > E[\pi_i | D]_t$**: **Cooperate (C)**. This happens only if the shared benefit from your cooperation, amplified by $(k/n)$, outweighs the guaranteed private endowment of 1. This is rare given $k < n$, but possible if the estimated cooperation rate of others is very high.
    *   **If $E[\pi_i | C]_t = E[\pi_i | D]_t$**: **Defect (D)**. In case of a tie, always err on the side of personal gain.

**Key Insight for Aggression:** Given $k < n$, the term $(k/n) \times (\text{total\_contributions})$ will always be less than the number of other cooperators *if* they are defecting. The dominant term for your payoff is the private endowment of 1 when you defect. Cooperation only becomes individually superior if the $(k/n)$ multiplier is substantial enough to offset your own lost endowment *and* significantly boost the shared pool from other cooperators. This is unlikely to be the case unless your opponents are overwhelmingly cooperating.

**Adaptive Element:** The strategy adapts by continuously updating its estimate of opponent behavior. If opponents are cooperating heavily, this strategy might temporarily cooperate if it's calculably beneficial for *you*. If opponents are defecting, this strategy will aggressively defect.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**a) First Round (t=1): The Default Aggression**

*   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
*   **Rationale:** There is no history. The safest and most aggressive play is to secure your private endowment. You have no information about your opponents, so assuming they might cooperate and you can exploit them is not yet feasible. You establish a baseline of self-interest.

**b) Last Round (t=r): The Pure Defection**

*   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
*   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The temptation to defect to guarantee your private endowment is absolute, as there's no opportunity to leverage cooperation for future gains or to punish defection. This is the ultimate expression of self-interest.

**c) Periods of High Opponent Cooperation (r > 1, t < r)**

*   **Observation:** If, in previous rounds, a significantly high proportion of players (e.g., > 75% of $(n-1)$ opponents) consistently cooperated.
*   **Decision Rule Check:** Re-evaluate the $E[\pi_i | C]_t$ vs $E[\pi_i | D]_t$ calculation. If cooperation becomes *individually* profitable for you (i.e., $E[\pi_i | C]_t > E[\pi_i | D]_t$), then **Cooperate (C)**.
*   **Aggressive Twist:** Even when cooperating, this is a *strategic* cooperation. You are doing it because the math says it's better for *you*. As soon as this condition ceases to hold, you revert to defecting. This is not about building trust; it's about maximizing your return in a specific, favorable scenario.

**d) Periods of Low Opponent Cooperation (r > 1, t < r)**

*   **Observation:** If, in previous rounds, a low proportion of players cooperated.
*   **Decision Rule:** Stick to the primary decision logic: **Defect (D)** if $E[\pi_i | D]_t > E[\pi_i | C]_t$. This will almost always be the case when others are defecting, ensuring you always secure your private endowment.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset

*   **Exploitation over Trust:** This strategy never builds trust. It assumes others might cooperate and seeks to extract maximum profit from their actions. If they defect, you defect too. If they cooperate, you defect unless cooperating offers a demonstrably higher payoff *for you*.
*   **Focus on Individual Payoff:** The sole metric for decision-making is your personal payoff in the current round, projected from historical data.
*   **Punishment Mechanism (Indirect):** While not explicitly punishing, by defecting when others cooperate (if it's not individually profitable), you are indirectly punishing their cooperation by not contributing to the public good when it might have been mutually beneficial, thus potentially lowering their future returns.
*   **No Forgiveness:** If an opponent defects, you will likely defect in response. There's no "cooling off" period or forgiveness mechanism built into this aggressive strategy. The decision is purely utilitarian for the current round.

description_AGGRESSIVE_59 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff while exploiting opportunities to benefit from others' cooperation.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Opportunistic Exploiter"

This strategy is built on the principle of **taking advantage of others' generosity while minimizing your own risk and contribution when possible.** It's aggressive in the sense that it prioritizes self-interest and seeks to extract maximum value, but it's also intelligent and adaptive, learning from the history of play.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Exploit Cooperation:** If others are cooperating, leverage that to increase your payoff without contributing yourself.
*   **Punish Defection (with a twist):** While true punishment might be costly, the strategy aims to *discourage* sustained defection from others by initially cooperating to gauge their behavior, but quickly shifting to defection if it becomes apparent that your cooperation isn't reciprocated or if others are consistently defecting.
*   **Adapt to the Environment:** The strategy continuously learns from the observed behavior of other players and adjusts its own actions accordingly.
*   **Maintain Flexibility:** Avoid rigid, predictable patterns that can be easily gamed by opponents.

### 1. Decision Rules (When to Cooperate vs. Defect)

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round is based on a dynamic assessment of the game's state, influenced by the observed behavior of the other `n-1` players.

**Key Metric: "Observed Cooperation Rate" (OCR)**

This metric represents the proportion of players who have cooperated in the *previous* round (excluding yourself).

*   **If `OCR` is HIGH (e.g., > 0.5):** This indicates a generally cooperative environment. Your strategy will **DEFECT**.
    *   **Reasoning:** You benefit from the public good generated by others' cooperation without incurring the cost of contributing. Your payoff is maximized by keeping your endowment and taking a share of the increased public good. This is the most aggressive and exploitative move.

*   **If `OCR` is MEDIUM (e.g., between 0.2 and 0.5):** This is a mixed environment. Your strategy will **COOPERATE**.
    *   **Reasoning:** You are testing the waters. Cooperating might encourage others to continue or increase their cooperation in the next round, leading to a higher overall public good. It also signals a willingness to engage, which can be beneficial in a complex environment where you want to avoid being seen as purely exploitative by *everyone*. However, this is a temporary state, and you'll quickly re-evaluate based on the next round's OCR.

*   **If `OCR` is LOW (e.g., ≤ 0.2):** This indicates a predominantly defecting environment. Your strategy will **DEFECT**.
    *   **Reasoning:** There's little to gain from cooperating when others are not. You maximize your individual payoff by keeping your endowment and not contributing to a meager public good.

**Refinement: "Defection Tolerance" (DT)**

To add a layer of sophistication and prevent immediate, overly harsh reactions, we introduce a "Defection Tolerance" variable. This represents how many rounds in a row you are willing to tolerate a low `OCR` before shifting strategy.

*   **Initial `DT`:** Set to a small value (e.g., 1 or 2).
*   **If `OCR` is LOW and you've defected for `DT` consecutive rounds:** You will **COOPERATE** for one round.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a strategic "reset." By cooperating, you signal that you're not irrevocably committed to defection and are willing to re-engage. This can sometimes "shock" a group of defectors into a higher OCR in the subsequent round. If this doesn't lead to a more cooperative environment, you'll return to defecting.
*   **If `OCR` is LOW and you haven't defected for `DT` consecutive rounds:** You will **DEFECT**.

**Aggressive Trigger for Cooperation:**

Your default state is **DEFECT**. You only cooperate strategically for a limited period when the observed cooperation is medium, or as a temporary reset after prolonged defection in a low-OCR environment.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Action:** **COOPERATE**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the very first round, there is no history. To get a baseline understanding of the environment and avoid immediate ostracization or being perceived as an outlier, it's best to start by cooperating. This allows you to gather data on the initial inclinations of your opponents. Your aggressive stance will emerge quickly in subsequent rounds based on this initial observation.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** **DEFECT**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future consequences to your actions. The incentive to maintain relationships or encourage future cooperation disappears. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to defect and maximize your individual payoff for that final round, regardless of past behavior.

*   **Rounds `r-1` and before:** The standard decision rules described above apply, using the `OCR` from the previous round.

### 3. Being Aggressive

*   **Default to Defection:** Your strategy prioritizes extracting value. You only cooperate when the observed environment *strongly* suggests that cooperating will lead to a greater personal gain (due to others' cooperation) or as a calculated, short-term tactic to potentially shift the group dynamic.
*   **Exploitative Power of Defection:** When `OCR` is high, your strategy maximizes its individual payoff by defecting. This is the hallmark of an aggressive, self-interested approach.
*   **Limited Patience:** The `Defection Tolerance` ensures that you don't get stuck cooperating in a consistently uncooperative environment for too long. You are not a "nice" player; you are an "effective" player.
*   **Strategic Reset:** The one-round cooperation after prolonged defection is not about altruism; it's a tactical move to try and manipulate the environment to your future advantage. It's a short-term investment to potentially unlock greater future exploitation.

    ELSE: // Medium cooperation environment (0.2 < OCR <= 0.5)
        RETURN "C" // Test the waters, potentially encouraging more cooperation (but will re-evaluate)

```

**Important Considerations for Implementation:**

*   **History Management:** You'll need to store your own actions and the actions of all other players for `r` rounds to calculate `OCR` and track consecutive defections.
*   **"Your" Action in History:** The calculation of `OCR` should be based on the *total* number of cooperators in the previous round, including yourself. However, when tracking "consecutive defections," you only count *your own* consecutive defections. This distinction is crucial for the "Defection Tolerance" logic.
*   **Adaptive Parameter Tuning:** While `DEFECT_TOLERANCE = 2` is a starting point, its optimal value might depend on the specific `n` and `k` values and the observed opponent strategies. You might consider an approach where this tolerance is also learned or adjusted over time based on the success of the strategic resets.

This "Opportunistic Exploiter" strategy is designed to be aggressive by prioritizing self-interest and exploiting cooperative environments, while remaining adaptive through its reliance on history and a calculated approach to interaction.

description_AGGRESSIVE_60 = '''
## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunistic Enforcer"

This strategy is designed to maximize individual gain in a repeated Public Goods Game, adopting an aggressive stance that prioritizes self-interest while leveraging the repeated nature of the game to punish defection and exploit cooperation. It aims to be adaptive, reacting to observed behaviors while maintaining an underlying aggressive predisposition.

### Core Philosophy: Aggression with Calculated Restraint

The "Opportunistic Enforcer" believes that in this game, the safest and most profitable path is to exploit the willingness of others to cooperate, while swiftly and decisively punishing any deviation from cooperation. It views cooperation as a tool to be leveraged when it benefits the individual, and defection as the default state when it does not.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round is primarily driven by the observed behavior of other players and the potential for future gains.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   The default action is to Defect. This is the aggressive stance. By defecting, the player guarantees themselves an immediate payoff of 1, regardless of what others do. This is the safe baseline and the starting point for opportunistic exploitation.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: Cooperate (C) - "The Leveraged Cooperation"**
    *   **Condition:** The player will only Cooperate if the *average payoff of cooperation in the previous round was strictly greater than the average payoff of defection in the previous round*.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the "opportunistic" element. The player analyzes the historical outcome of cooperation. If, on average, players who cooperated in the previous round ended up with a higher payoff than those who defected, it suggests that the group's collective contributions created a sufficiently large public good to benefit even those who contributed. In such scenarios, the player is willing to contribute to sustain this beneficial outcome, as their own payoff will be enhanced.
    *   **Calculation:**
        *   Let $N_C$ be the number of cooperators in the previous round.
        *   Let $N_D$ be the number of defectors in the previous round.
        *   Average payoff for a cooperator in the previous round: $Avg(\pi_C) = \frac{(k/n) \times N_C}{N_C}$ (assuming $N_C > 0$)
        *   Average payoff for a defector in the previous round: $Avg(\pi_D) = \frac{1 + (k/n) \times N_C}{N_D}$ (assuming $N_D > 0$)
        *   **Decision:** If $Avg(\pi_C) > Avg(\pi_D)$, then the player will consider cooperating in the current round. Otherwise, they will defect.

*   **Enforcement Mechanism: Defect (D) - "The Punishing Strike"**
    *   **Condition:** If in the *immediately preceding round*, the total number of cooperators ($N_C$) was less than or equal to the number of defectors ($N_D$), the player will **Defect** in the current round, *regardless of the average payoff calculation*.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the "enforcer" element. If cooperation isn't widespread enough to generate a significant benefit (i.e., there are more defectors than cooperators), it signals that the group is not effectively pooling resources. In such cases, the player immediately withdraws their cooperation, not only to protect their own endowment but also to send a clear signal that such a low level of cooperation is unacceptable. This also serves to punish those who might have defected in the previous round.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any historical data, the most aggressive and self-preserving action is to defect. The player has no information to leverage and therefore defaults to their baseline aggressive strategy. This establishes the "Opportunistic Enforcer" as a player who doesn't immediately trust or cooperate.

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** Since there are no future rounds to influence or exploit, the incentive for cooperation disappears. The player's sole objective becomes maximizing their payoff in this final round. Defecting guarantees an individual payoff of 1, which is the best guaranteed outcome in the absence of any collective benefit from cooperation.

*   **Scenario: All Players Cooperate in the Previous Round ($N_C = n$, $N_D = 0$)**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** If everyone cooperated, the average payoff for cooperators will be $(k/n) \times n = k$. The average payoff for defectors (which doesn't exist in this case) would be undefined. However, the condition for cooperation is that the average payoff of cooperation is greater than the average payoff of defection. In this scenario, $k > 1$ (given parameter $1 < k < n$). The payoff for a defector in this scenario would be $1 + (k/n) \times n = 1+k$. However, the player's decision rule for *cooperating* is based on the *previous round's average payoffs*. If everyone cooperated in the previous round, the average payoff for a cooperator is $k$. The average payoff for a defector would be $1 + (k/n) \times n = 1+k$. If $k>1$, then $1+k > k$. This suggests they should defect.

    Let's refine this. The core of the "Leveraged Cooperation" is comparing the *achieved payoff* of cooperation vs. defection.

    *   **If $N_C = n$ (all players cooperated in the previous round):**
        *   Payoff for a cooperator (which this player was): $\pi_i = 0 + (k/n) \times n = k$.
        *   Payoff for a defector (if any had existed): $\pi_i = 1 + (k/n) \times n = 1+k$.
        *   Average cooperator payoff = $k$. Average defector payoff = $1+k$.
        *   Since $1+k > k$, the condition for cooperation ($Avg(\pi_C) > Avg(\pi_D)$) is *not met*. Therefore, the player *defaults to Defect*. This is the aggressive part. Even when everyone cooperates, they don't automatically reciprocate if they believe defecting offers a higher immediate gain in the *next* round.

    *   **Revised "Leveraged Cooperation" Condition:** The player will Cooperate if and only if:
        *   **The total payoff from collective cooperation in the previous round ($k \times N_C$) is significantly greater than the sum of individual endowments ($N_C$ if $N_C$ players cooperated, or $N_C + N_D$ if everyone contributed to the pot).**
        *   More formally, the player will cooperate if the expected increase in their payoff from cooperation outweighs the guaranteed payoff from defection. This happens when the *per-player benefit from the public good* is greater than the endowment lost from contributing.
        *   **Let's simplify the condition for cooperation to avoid complex average payoff comparisons that might be ambiguous.** The "Opportunistic Enforcer" will cooperate if:
            *   **The total number of cooperators in the previous round ($N_C$) was greater than or equal to $n/2$ (i.e., at least half the players cooperated), AND the total payoff generated for the *cooperators* was greater than the sum of their individual endowments.**
            *   Total payoff for cooperators = $(k/n) \times N_C \times N_C$. (This is incorrect. The payoff is $(k/n) \times N_C$ *per cooperator*).
            *   **Corrected "Leveraged Cooperation" Condition:** The player will Cooperate if the following two conditions are met:
                1.  **Sufficient Cooperation Level:** The number of cooperators in the previous round ($N_C$) was greater than or equal to $n/2$.
                2.  **Positive Return on Investment for Cooperators:** The average payoff received by cooperators in the previous round was strictly greater than 1 (their initial endowment before the public good calculation). Average cooperator payoff = $(k/n) \times N_C$. So, the condition is $(k/n) \times N_C > 1$.

*   **Scenario: Very Few Cooperators in the Previous Round ($N_C < n/2$)**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** The "Sufficient Cooperation Level" condition for cooperation is not met. This means the collective effort isn't strong enough to justify personal contribution.

*   **Scenario: "Break-even" or Loss for Cooperators ($N_C \ge n/2$ but $(k/n) \times N_C \le 1$)**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** Even if enough people cooperated, if the public good didn't provide a return greater than the endowment lost, then cooperation was not individually beneficial. The player will defect to secure their endowment.

### 3. Aggressive Nature

The "Opportunistic Enforcer" is aggressive in several ways:

*   **Default Defection:** Starting with defection is inherently aggressive. It signals a lack of trust and a prioritization of self-interest.
*   **Strict Enforcement:** The "Punishing Strike" is a direct and harsh response to low cooperation levels, designed to deter free-riding and enforce a perceived norm (albeit one that benefits the Enforcer).
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Cooperation is not offered freely but is a reward for past successful collective action that demonstrably benefited cooperators. It's a calculated risk, not an act of altruism.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy does not include mechanisms for forgiveness or re-establishing trust after defection. Once a player defects, the "Opportunistic Enforcer" may continue to defect against them, especially if they don't meet the "Sufficient Cooperation Level" and "Positive Return on Investment" criteria.
*   **Exploitative Tendency:** The strategy is designed to benefit from others' cooperation. If enough players cooperate and create a large public good, the "Opportunistic Enforcer" will join in to reap the rewards, but only if the conditions are met. It's opportunistic, not altruistic.

'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_61 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize its own payoff by exploiting cooperation while retaliating against defection. It's adaptive, robust, and prioritizes aggressive gain.

## Strategy: The "Aggressive Opportunist"

This strategy is fundamentally driven by self-interest and a desire to maximize individual payoff. It aims to leverage periods of cooperation from others to its advantage, but immediately punishes any deviation from cooperation by switching to defection. The core principle is to extract as much as possible when opportunities arise and to shut down exploitation by others.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

**The "Aggressive Opportunist" cooperates only when it perceives a strategic advantage or a strong signal of widespread cooperation. Otherwise, it defects.**

Here's how it translates into specific rules:

*   **Initial Stance: Defect (Round 1)**
    *   In the very first round, the strategy will **defect**. This is the most aggressive stance. It assumes no prior history and prioritizes securing its baseline payoff of 1. It's testing the waters and doesn't want to be the "sucker" cooperating without guarantee.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: "If They Cooperate, I'll Exploit"**
    *   The strategy will **cooperate** if, in the *previous round*, **at least one other player cooperated AND the total number of cooperators was greater than or equal to a defined threshold.**
    *   **Threshold Calculation:** This threshold is crucial for its opportunistic nature. A good starting point is: `Threshold = max(1, floor(n * (k/n)))`. This means it will cooperate if at least one other player cooperates *and* the collective contribution has a reasonable chance of generating a positive return for everyone (even if it's slightly less than what defectors get). A simpler, more aggressive threshold could be `Threshold = 1` (meaning it will cooperate if at least one other player cooperates). Let's refine this:
        *   **Refined Threshold:** The strategy will cooperate if, in the previous round, `total_cooperators_previous_round >= 2`. This ensures it's not the *only* one cooperating, and there's a clear benefit being generated by the group. If only one other player cooperates, the return might be too low for this aggressive strategy to consider it worthwhile.

*   **Immediate Retaliation: "Defect if Exploited or if Cooperation Fails"**
    *   The strategy will **defect** in the current round if:
        *   **It played C in the previous round, and another player defected.** This is a strict punishment for being taken advantage of.
        *   **It played C in the previous round, and the total number of cooperators was less than 2.** This means the group cooperation was insufficient to be beneficial.
        *   **In any round where the initial defect rule (Round 1) is in effect and conditions for cooperation are not met.**

*   **The "N-1" Rule: If Everyone Else Cooperates, I Defect**
    *   This is the most aggressive element. If, in the previous round, *all other n-1 players cooperated*, this strategy will **defect**. The rationale is that this is the absolute prime condition for exploitation: the public good will be maximized, and the strategy gets to keep its endowment while still receiving a large share of the public good.
    *   This rule overrides the "Conditional Cooperation" rule.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:** As stated above, the strategy will **defect**. It prioritizes securing its baseline payoff and assesses the environment without commitment.

*   **Last Round (Round r):** In the final round, there is no future to consider. The strategy becomes purely myopic and maximally aggressive.
    *   **Last Round Rule:** The strategy will **always defect in the last round (round r)**, regardless of history. This is because the incentive to build trust or retaliate for future rounds disappears. It maximizes its immediate payoff by keeping its endowment.

*   **Early Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):** The primary decision rules (conditional cooperation, immediate retaliation, and the "N-1" rule) apply here, driven by the history of the previous round.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **Defect-First Mentality:** Starting with defection is inherently aggressive. It signals a lack of trust and a focus on immediate self-preservation.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** Cooperating only when it benefits *this* strategy significantly, and when others are bearing the brunt of the risk, is opportunistic and aggressive. The "N-1" rule is the epitome of this.
*   **Swift and Severe Retaliation:** Immediately punishing any perceived exploitation by returning to defection prevents others from continuously exploiting this strategy. This aggressive response discourages such behavior.
*   **Maximizing Individual Payoff:** The entire strategy is geared towards ensuring this player's payoff is as high as possible, even at the potential expense of collective efficiency. The assumption is that if others are cooperating, this player can extract more by defecting when everyone else contributes.

    // This player defected in the previous round, but others cooperated.
    // The current logic assumes history is from PREVIOUS round.
    // Let's rephrase: If in the previous round, total_cooperators_previous_round was n-1 (meaning everyone but me cooperated).
    // Then in THIS round, I should defect to exploit.

    // Check player's own action in previous round
    my_previous_action = history.my_action_in_previous_round
    if my_previous_action == C:
        // This scenario is unlikely with pure defection in round 1.
        // However, if it happened, the "N-1" rule would still apply.
        // We need to consider the state of the world.
        // If all others cooperated, and I cooperated last round, then the total would be N.
        // The "N-1" rule is most potent when others cooperate and I defect.

        // Let's adjust the "N-1" rule for clarity:
        // If in the PREVIOUS round, all n-1 other players chose C, AND I chose D,
        // THEN in the CURRENT round, I should defect.
        // This condition implies total_cooperators_previous_round = n-1
        // AND my_previous_action = D.
        // This would mean the payoff was (1-0) + (k/n)*(n-1) for me.
        // If I were to cooperate this round, I'd get 0 + (k/n)*n = k.
        // Since k > 1, defecting gives 1 + (k/n)*(n-1) which is > 1.
        // Cooperating would give k.
        // If k is significantly larger than 1, defecting is better.
        // However, the prompt states k < n. The payoff for defecting is 1 + k - k/n.
        // The payoff for cooperating is k.
        // For defecting to be better, 1 + k - k/n > k, which simplifies to 1 > k/n.
        // This is TRUE given k < n. So the "N-1" rule is always optimal for me to defect.

        // So, IF total_cooperators_previous_round == n - 1, it means everyone else cooperated.
        // The strategy should have been defecting to be aggressive.
        // This logic needs to be about the decision for *this* round based on *last* round.

        // REVISED "N-1" Rule Interpretation:
        // If in the previous round, ALL OTHER players played C:
        // If I played C last round, total_cooperators = n. I get k.
        // If I played D last round, total_cooperators = n-1. I get 1 + k*(n-1)/n.
        // Given k < n, 1 > k/n. Thus 1 + k - k/n > k.
        // So if others cooperated, defecting last round was better.
        // The goal is to *continue* to exploit this.
        // So if in the previous round, all n-1 others were C:
        if total_cooperators_previous_round == n - 1:
             return D // Exploit!

  // Rule 2: Conditional Cooperation (if others cooperate)
  // Cooperate ONLY if at least 2 players cooperated in the previous round
  // AND it was not the case that all others cooperated (handled by Rule 1)
  // AND I did not get exploited (handled by Rule 3)
  if total_cooperators_previous_round >= 2:
    // Check if I was exploited in the previous round
    my_previous_action = history.my_action_in_previous_round
    if my_previous_action == C and total_cooperators_previous_round < n: // Exploited
        return D
    else: // Not exploited, and sufficient cooperation from others
        return C

  // Rule 3: Immediate Retaliation (if exploited or cooperation failed)
  // If I cooperated in the previous round and was exploited, defect.
  my_previous_action = history.my_action_in_previous_round
  if my_previous_action == C and total_cooperators_previous_round < n: // Exploited
    return D

  // If cooperation in the previous round was insufficient (less than 2 cooperators)
  if total_cooperators_previous_round < 2:
    return D

  // Default: If none of the above conditions are met, default to Defect (most aggressive)
  return D

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Refinements:**

The pseudocode is a bit tricky to represent the exact "aggressive opportunist" flow perfectly without a fully defined history object. The key is to capture the **decision for the current round based on the outcome of the previous round.**

*   **Round 1 & Last Round:** Handled explicitly.
*   **The "N-1" Rule (Most Aggressive Exploitation):** If, in the previous round, the total number of cooperators was `n-1`, it means every other player cooperated. In this scenario, this strategy would have defected (to be aggressive) and received a very high payoff: `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. To continue exploiting this high-yield situation (assuming others will continue to cooperate), the strategy defects again in the current round.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** If there were at least 2 cooperators in the previous round, and the "N-1" scenario wasn't met, and the strategy wasn't exploited, it *might* cooperate. This is where the aggressive edge comes in: it still requires a significant level of group cooperation for it to risk cooperating.
*   **Immediate Retaliation:** If the strategy cooperated in the previous round (`my_previous_action == C`) and not everyone else cooperated (`total_cooperators_previous_round < n`), it means it was exploited. It immediately defects.
*   **Insufficient Cooperation:** If fewer than 2 players cooperated in the previous round, the group benefit is likely too small, so it defects.
*   **Default Defection:** In any ambiguous situation, the default is defection for maximal aggression.

This strategy is designed to be a disruptive force in the tournament, leveraging moments of widespread cooperation for maximum personal gain while swiftly punishing any perceived exploitation. It prioritizes its own immediate payoff over fostering long-term, stable cooperation.

description_AGGRESSIVE_62 = '''
Here's an aggressive, adaptive, and history-dependent strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for a tournament setting where trust is not a given.

## Aggressive "Tit-for-Tat" with an Advantage

This strategy is an adaptation of the famous "Tit-for-Tat" strategy, but with a clear aggressive bias and mechanisms to exploit opportunities while punishing defection swiftly. The core idea is to be conditionally cooperative, but to aggressively punish deviations and be the first to defect when it's strategically advantageous.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

Our strategy, let's call it **"Aggressive Punisher"**, operates as follows:

**Default Behavior: Defect**

*   **Aggression is the default.** Unless specific conditions are met, we will choose to defect. This maximizes our private payoff in the short term and forces others to reveal their intentions.

**Conditions for Cooperation:**

We will only cooperate if *all* of the following conditions are met in the *previous* round:

1.  **Full Cooperation:** Every single player, including ourselves, played 'C' in the previous round.
2.  **Sufficient Reward:** The total payoff we received in the previous round was at least the maximum possible private payoff we could have achieved by defecting in that round, assuming all others cooperated. This translates to: `π_i,t-1 >= 1`. (Given that `k > 1` and `n >= 2`, this condition is automatically met if everyone cooperates, as `π_i = 2`).
3.  **No Previous Defections (by others):** No other player has defected against us (i.e., played 'D') in the *entire history* of the game *prior* to the previous round. This is a strong signal of a truly cooperative environment.

**Conditions for Defection:**

We will defect if *any* of the following conditions are met:

1.  **Any Defection by Others:** If *any* player other than ourselves played 'D' in the previous round. This is our primary trigger for punishment.
2.  **Insufficient Cooperation Reward:** If we played 'C' in the previous round, but the total number of cooperators was *less than n*. This indicates that despite our cooperation, others did not reciprocate fully, and we were exploited.
3.  **Strategic Advantage for Defection (Early Rounds):** In the very early rounds (specifically, the first `max(2, floor(r/4))` rounds), if we have *not* observed full cooperation from all players in the *previous* round, we will defect. This allows us to test the waters and gather information while minimizing our initial risk.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Always Defect.** This is our initial aggressive stance. We want to immediately signal that we are not a pushover and are seeking to maximize our individual gain. We need to see how others react to our defection.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Always Defect.** In the final round, there are no future rounds to consider for retaliation or reciprocity. The dominant strategy in a one-shot game is to defect to maximize your immediate payoff. Our aggressive nature dictates this certainty.

*   **Rounds where `k/n` is very low:**
    *   If `k/n <= 0.5`, the public good generated by one cooperator is less than the cost of private endowment. In such scenarios, cooperation is inherently risky. Our strategy's default to defect and conditional cooperation naturally handles this. We'll only cooperate if everyone else is *also* cooperating and we're not being exploited.

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained

*   **Default Defection:** We start by defecting, forcing others to react and reveal their intentions. This is inherently aggressive as it assumes others may try to exploit us.
*   **Swift and Severe Punishment:** Any defection by *any* player immediately triggers our defection in the next round. We do not give second chances. This is the core of our "punisher" aspect.
*   **Exploitation of Opportunity:** We only consider cooperating if there's a *history* of absolute, unanimous cooperation, and we have received a decent payoff. This means we are not easily swayed by limited cooperation; we need overwhelming evidence before we reciprocate.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Unlike some standard Tit-for-Tat strategies, we don't "forgive" a single defection after a period of cooperation. If someone defects, they are marked, and we will likely defect against them for a significant period (or until our conditions for cooperation are met again, which is unlikely with a persistent defector).
*   **Last Round Certainty:** Our definitive defection in the last round reinforces our commitment to maximizing individual gain, leaving no room for sentimentality or building long-term relationships that don't exist.

```

**Rationale for Aggression:**

In a tournament setting with unknown opponents, assuming the worst and acting defensively is a strong starting point. This strategy doesn't shy away from conflict; it embraces it by punishing deviations and only cooperating when there's overwhelming evidence of a truly cooperative environment. This approach aims to:

*   **Discourage exploitation:** By punishing defection immediately, we send a clear message that exploiting us will lead to retaliation.
*   **Identify genuine cooperators:** We only reward sustained, unanimous cooperation, making our cooperation a highly valued signal.
*   **Maximize short-term gains:** Our default defection and last-round defection prioritize immediate payoff.
*   **Adaptability:** The strategy reacts to observed behavior, making it robust to a wide range of strategies played by opponents. It can adapt to fully cooperative, fully defecting, or mixed strategies.

This strategy is designed to be a tough competitor, aiming to win by outlasting, outmaneuvering, and punishing those who try to take advantage.

It leverages the repeated nature of the game and the parameters to create a strong incentive for others to cooperate, while also protecting its own endowment.

### Dominant Retaliation Strategy

**Core Philosophy:** "My endowment is paramount. I will defect unless guaranteed a significantly higher payoff from cooperation. Any hint of exploitation will be met with immediate and sustained retaliation."

---

**1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect**

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is based on a dynamic evaluation of the potential payoff in the current round, heavily influenced by the observed behavior of other players and the game parameters.

*   **Initial Tendency: Defect (D)**
    *   Unless there's a strong, immediate incentive, the default action is to Defect. This ensures the player always secures at least their endowment of 1, avoiding being exploited.

*   **Conditional Cooperation Trigger:**
    *   **Cooperate (C) IF:**
        *   The expected payoff from cooperating **significantly exceeds** the payoff from defecting in the current round. This "significant excess" is defined as an increase of at least **X%** over the payoff from defecting, where X is a strategic parameter (e.g., 20-30%).
        *   **AND** the total number of cooperators in the **previous round** was **greater than or equal to** `ceil(n * (k/n))` (i.e., at least enough cooperators for the *average* payoff to be greater than 1, ensuring the public good is efficient).
        *   **AND** the player has not detected a pattern of systematic exploitation by a significant portion of the player pool in recent rounds.

*   **Retaliation Trigger:**
    *   **Immediately Defect (D) IF:**
        *   In the previous round, the player's payoff was **less than 1** (meaning they cooperated and were exploited).
        *   **OR** the player observes that the total number of cooperators in the previous round was **less than `ceil(n * (k/n))`** AND the player **cooperated** in the previous round. This signals an inefficient use of resources, and the player will not subsidize free-riders.
        *   **OR** a majority of players (more than n/2) defected in the previous round. This indicates a widespread shift towards defection, and the strategy will fall back to pure self-preservation.

*   **Default Defection:** If none of the cooperation or immediate retaliation triggers are met, the player Defects. This ensures a baseline payoff of 1.

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases**

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** In the absence of any history, the strategy prioritizes securing its endowment and observing the landscape. There is no reliable signal to cooperate.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** In the final round, there is no future consequence for defection. The strategy maximizes its immediate payoff by keeping its endowment. This is a direct application of the logic behind the Prisoner's Dilemma in its one-shot form.

*   **"Bad" Player Identification (Advanced):** While the prompt states no reliance on specific coordination mechanisms, an adaptive strategy should still be able to identify and react to consistent exploiters.
    *   If a player is observed to defect consistently when others cooperate, or to defect more often than they cooperate, they will be treated as a "bad actor."
    *   If more than a certain threshold (e.g., 20% of players) are identified as "bad actors," the strategy will shift to a more aggressive "pure defection" mode, defecting in all subsequent rounds regardless of other conditions, until the tournament ends.

---

**3. Aggressiveness**

This strategy is inherently aggressive in the following ways:

*   **Default Self-Interest:** It starts by prioritizing its own endowment, only deviating if there's a clear and substantial advantage.
*   **Punitive Retaliation:** It reacts swiftly and decisively to any perceived exploitation or inefficiency. The "retaliation trigger" is designed to punish defectors and signal that cooperation is only rewarded when it's reciprocated or when it leads to a demonstrably better outcome for the player.
*   **No "Forgiveness" by Default:** Unlike some tit-for-tat strategies, this strategy doesn't automatically forgive a single defection. It requires a sustained period of cooperation from others to feel secure enough to cooperate, and a single act of exploitation can lead to a prolonged period of defection.
*   **Exploits the "Free Rider" Problem:** By defecting when cooperation is inefficient (less than `ceil(n * (k/n))` cooperators), it refuses to subsidize the public good when it's not paying off.
*   **"Dominant" in its own sphere:** It aims to dominate individual outcomes by securing a high baseline payoff and aggressively punishing deviations. It doesn't seek cooperation for its own sake, but rather as a tool to maximize personal gain when circumstances are favorable and safe.

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for repeated interaction and a focus on maximizing your own payoff while being adaptable to various opponent behaviors.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploit and Deter"

This strategy is built on the principle of **maximizing immediate individual gain** while **discouraging free-riding** and **punishing defection**. It aims to extract as much value as possible from the public good when it's beneficial, but quickly pivots to pure self-interest when cooperation is exploited.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Aggression:** Always look for opportunities to benefit from others' cooperation.
*   **Exploitation:** Capitalize on the public good's benefits when they outweigh your contribution cost.
*   **Deterrence:** Punish free-riders to discourage them from exploiting you in the future.
*   **Adaptability:** Continuously adjust based on the observed behavior of the group.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is primarily driven by a **threshold-based assessment of the expected group behavior** and a **deterrence mechanism**.

**Key Concept: "Cooperation Threshold" (CT)**

The strategy will define a dynamic "Cooperation Threshold" (CT). This threshold represents the minimum number of players expected to cooperate for you to consider cooperating. If the perceived number of cooperators is *above* this threshold, you'll cooperate. If it's *at or below*, you'll defect.

**Initial Threshold:**
The initial CT will be set high, leaning towards demanding strong collective action to justify your cooperation. A good starting point could be:
`Initial CT = floor(n * (k/n))` which simplifies to `Initial CT = floor(k)` but given `k < n`, it's more about proportion. Let's refine this: the payoff from cooperating when everyone else defects is 1. The payoff from defecting when everyone else cooperates is `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. You want to cooperate only if the benefit to *everyone* from your cooperation is significant. A reasonable starting point might be aiming for **at least half the players to cooperate**.
`Initial CT = floor(n / 2) + 1` (This aims for strict majority cooperation).

**Dynamic Adjustment of CT:**

*   **If the group cooperates well (i.e., your cooperation leads to a high average payoff for the group and yourself):** You may **slightly decrease** your CT to encourage continued cooperation, but not too much to avoid being exploited.
*   **If the group defects heavily, or if your cooperation is met with widespread defection (i.e., you cooperate and most others defect, leading to low individual payoff):** You will **significantly increase** your CT, effectively demanding near-unanimous cooperation before you'll contribute.

**Specific Decision Logic:**

**In any given round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

1.  **Assess Current Group Behavior:** Look at the history of the game. Estimate the number of players who have *consistently* cooperated and those who have *consistently* defected. A simple heuristic could be to count players who defected in the previous round. Let `observed_cooperators_last_round` be the number of players who played 'C' in round `t-1`.
2.  **Calculate Expected Cooperators:** Based on observed behavior, form an expectation about the number of cooperators in the current round. For an aggressive strategy, this expectation should be pessimistic. Let `expected_cooperators = observed_cooperators_last_round` (simplistic, but emphasizes caution). A more refined approach: count players who have cooperated for the last `X` rounds, and those who have defected for the last `X` rounds.
3.  **Decision Rule:**
    *   **If `expected_cooperators` >= `CT` AND `CT` is not excessively high (e.g., CT < n-1):**
        *   **Play C (Cooperate).** You are incentivized to cooperate if you believe enough others will do so to make it worthwhile, or if you are trying to lure others into cooperation by setting an example.
    *   **Else (if `expected_cooperators` < `CT` OR `CT` is very high, implying strong suspicion):**
        *   **Play D (Defect).** You are prioritizing your own immediate gain and refusing to be the "sucker."

**Aggressive Element: "Punishment Phase"**

*   **Trigger:** If, in any round, you play **C** and the number of cooperators (including yourself) is **less than `floor(n/2)`**, and your individual payoff for that round (`π_i`) is **less than 1** (meaning you lost money on your contribution), this triggers a severe punishment response.
*   **Action:** Immediately set your **CT to `n - 1`** for the next `r/2` rounds (or a significant portion of the remaining rounds). This means you will **only cooperate if every single other player cooperates**. This is a strong deterrent against free-riding.
*   **Relaxation:** After the punishment phase, you can gradually lower your CT again, but cautiously.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1): The "Wait and See" Approach (with a slightly aggressive bias)**
    *   **Action: Play D (Defect).**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no history. An aggressive strategy doesn't want to be the first to contribute to a potential free-rider scenario. By defecting, you observe what others do without risking your endowment. Your payoff is guaranteed to be at least 1. This initial defection also sets a tone that you are not a guaranteed cooperator.
    *   **CT Initialization:** Set `CT = floor(n / 2) + 1`.

*   **Last Round (t=r): The "Pure Self-Interest" Mandate**
    *   **Action: Play D (Defect).**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future consequences. The incentive to build trust or maintain cooperation disappears. The optimal strategy for a purely self-interested agent in a single-shot game is to defect. An aggressive strategy that aims to maximize total payoff will always defect in the last round.

*   **Rounds Before the Last Round (t = r-1, r-2, ...):**
    *   Follow the standard decision rules outlined above, with the CT dynamically adjusting.
    *   **Key consideration:** As you approach the last round, the incentive to cooperate for future benefits diminishes. The strategy should implicitly account for this by becoming more risk-averse and demanding stronger signals of cooperation as `t` gets closer to `r`. This is naturally handled by the dynamic CT adjustment: if the group has been cooperative, CT might be low. If it's been exploitative, CT will be high. The nearer to the end, the more likely CT will be high and trigger defection.

### 3. Aggressiveness Manifested

*   **Always Defect First:** No initial cooperation. You'll earn at least 1 in round 1.
*   **High Initial CT:** Requires a strong signal of cooperation from others before you consider contributing.
*   **Punishment Phase:** A severe response to being exploited (cooperating when it backfires). This makes other players wary of defecting against you.
*   **No Forgiveness (initially):** The punishment phase is long and strict. You are not quick to forgive perceived exploitation.
*   **Maximizing Individual Gain:** The strategy is designed to benefit from the public good *when it's safe and profitable to do so*, not out of altruism. If cooperation yields a higher payoff for you, you'll do it, but only if the conditions are right.

description_AGGRESSIVE_65 = '''
This aggressive strategy, "Enforcer," aims to maximize individual payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game by exploiting periods of cooperation and punishing deviations swiftly. It's designed to be opportunistic and unforgiving, reflecting an aggressive stance.

## Enforcer Strategy Design

The Enforcer strategy is built on the principle of **tit-for-tat, but with a punitive escalation mechanism**. It starts with a degree of trust, but any defection is met with immediate and sustained retaliation, designed to deter future free-riding.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core decision-making logic of the Enforcer is as follows:

*   **Initial Cooperation (Controlled):** In the very first round, the Enforcer will cooperate. This is a calculated risk to establish a baseline and test the waters. However, this initial cooperation is limited in duration.

*   **Punishment Phase:** If *any* other player defects in a given round, the Enforcer will immediately switch to defecting in all subsequent rounds until a specific condition is met. This is the aggressive core of the strategy.

*   **Reward for Sustained Cooperation (Conditional):** The Enforcer will only revert to cooperating if *all* other players have consistently cooperated for a predetermined number of consecutive rounds. This "amnesty period" is designed to ensure that a return to cooperation is based on a solid foundation of collective commitment, not a temporary lull in defection.

*   **Strategic Opportunism:** If the Enforcer is in a punishment phase (i.e., defecting due to past defections), but observes that *all* other players are cooperating, it will *continue to defect*. This is a key element of its aggressiveness – it aims to benefit from the collective good created by others without contributing, as long as it believes this is the most profitable short-term move. The Enforcer prioritizes its own immediate gain when it perceives an opportunity.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** Cooperate (C).
    *   **Rationale:** To initiate the game and observe initial behaviors without immediate aggression. This also allows for a potential initial period of mutual benefit if others cooperate.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The Enforcer will extract maximum private payoff by keeping its endowment, regardless of past history. This is a purely self-interested and aggressive move in the absence of future interaction.

*   **Rounds Leading Up to the Last Round (t = r-1, r-2, ...):**
    *   The Enforcer's behavior in these rounds is still governed by its primary decision rules (punishment, conditional reward). However, as the game approaches its end, the incentive to cooperate for future gains diminishes. The strategy remains adaptive but the "punishment" aspect becomes more dominant if triggered, as the cost of sustained defection is lower.

*   **Enforcer's Own Defection History:** The Enforcer does not track its own past defections for decision-making. Its decisions are reactive to the observed actions of others.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

The Enforcer's aggressiveness is manifested in several ways:

*   **Swift and Severe Punishment:** A single defection by any player triggers a permanent shift to defection for the Enforcer, unless a very high bar of sustained cooperation is met. This is a harsh penalty.
*   **Opportunistic Defection During Punishment:** When in a punishment phase, if all other players are cooperating, the Enforcer *exploits* this situation by continuing to defect. It leverages the collective good created by others for its own private gain. This is a key aggressive differentiator from standard tit-for-tat.
*   **Unconditional Defection in the Final Round:** The Enforcer is not swayed by past cooperation when the game is about to end; it prioritizes maximum immediate gain.
*   **High Threshold for Reinstating Cooperation:** The "amnesty period" (number of consecutive rounds of cooperation required to resume cooperation) should be set relatively high. This makes it difficult for others to "earn back" cooperation, ensuring the Enforcer's initial punishment is impactful.

            return C // Cooperate

// Note on `history_of_actions_of_others`: The implementation will need to manage this history to correctly
// determine if "any other player" defected in the previous round, and to track consecutive cooperation.
// The logic for `consecutive_cooperators` should also consider if the *Enforcer itself* is the reason
// cooperation is not universal, but for simplicity in this pseudocode, it focuses on others.
// In a real implementation, `consecutive_cooperators` would ideally be incremented only if *all* other players
// played C in a round where the Enforcer also played C, or if the Enforcer was in punishment mode
// and all others played C. The current pseudocode simplifies this to "all others cooperated".
```

This "Enforcer" strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent by punishing deviations severely and exploiting periods of perceived weakness or collective good-doing by others. It prioritizes its own gain and seeks to exert a strong influence on the game's dynamics through its aggressive stance.

description_AGGRESSIVE_66 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative tendencies while being prepared for defection.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunist"

The core principle of "The Opportunist" is to exploit the inherent incentive to defect in this game. The private benefit of defecting (keeping your endowment) is always 1. The public benefit of cooperating is shared, and with `k < n`, your individual share of the collective contribution is less than what you would gain by defecting. Therefore, defection is always the individually rational choice in a single round, *assuming other players defect*. However, if others *do* cooperate, a defector can still gain more than a cooperator. This strategy aims to maximize these gains.

**Aggressive Mindset:** "The Opportunist" believes that cooperation is a vulnerability. It views the endowment as its own until proven otherwise, and it will only contribute if it can extract a demonstrably higher payoff than by defecting, or if it has no other choice. It seeks to punish perceived exploitation by other players and reward its own successful exploitation.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

"The Opportunist" operates with a clear bias towards **Defecting**. Cooperation is a rare and conditional event, triggered only when it offers a guaranteed superior payoff or as a strategic punishment.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**. In the absence of specific conditions triggering cooperation, the default action is to keep your endowment.

*   **Conditional Cooperation (Exploitation Trigger):**
    *   **If, in the *previous* round, the *total number of cooperators was greater than or equal to `ceil(n/2)`* (i.e., at least half the players, rounded up, cooperated):**
        *   **Then, play Cooperate (C).**
        *   **Reasoning:** This indicates a strong propensity for cooperation in the group. By cooperating in this round, "The Opportunist" aims to be part of the "good" group that receives the amplified payoff. The `k/n` multiplier means that if enough people cooperate, the shared benefit *can* outweigh the private benefit of keeping your endowment for everyone. This is the strategy's only mechanism for "joining" a cooperative round if it seems beneficial for *all*. It's opportunistic: if others are doing the work, "The Opportunist" will reap the rewards of the collective effort, but on its own terms.

*   **Punishment for Defection (Reactive Defection):**
    *   **If, in the *previous* round, the *total number of cooperators was less than `ceil(n/2)`* (i.e., less than half the players cooperated):**
        *   **Then, play Defect (D).**
        *   **Reasoning:** This signals a lack of widespread cooperation, or perhaps even exploitation by others. "The Opportunist" refuses to be the "sucker" who cooperates when the collective benefit is low. It will defect to maximize its private gain.

*   **No "Forgiveness" or "Tit-for-Tat" in the traditional sense:** This strategy is not about reciprocity. It's about assessing the *current* round's potential profitability based on the *previous* round's group behavior. It doesn't aim to build trust, but to exploit environments where cooperation is already strong and punish environments where it is weak.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no history. "The Opportunist" has no information about the other players' tendencies. The default aggressive stance is to defect and secure the private payoff of 1. This is the safest and most immediately profitable option when uncertainty is highest.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for actions. The incentive to cooperate for future benefits or to avoid future punishment disappears. Therefore, regardless of past history, the rational and aggressive choice in the last round is to always defect and maximize immediate private payoff.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (2 to `r-1`):** The decision rules described in section 1 apply. The strategy adapts based on the outcome of the *immediately preceding* round.

### 3. Aggressiveness Justification

*   **Default to Defect:** The most aggressive stance is to assume others will try to exploit you and to therefore prioritize your own immediate gain. Cooperation is only considered when the group's behavior *already* creates a situation where joining the cooperators is more profitable than defecting.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation Trigger:** The threshold of `ceil(n/2)` cooperators is a strategic choice. It's high enough to suggest a genuine, self-sustaining cooperative effort is underway, where "The Opportunist" can benefit from the amplified public good. It's not a low threshold that would lead to easy exploitation of "The Opportunist" itself.
*   **Punitive Defection:** When the group fails to reach this threshold, "The Opportunist" punishes that perceived lack of cooperation (or attempts at exploitation) by defecting, ensuring it doesn't contribute to a low-yield public good.
*   **No Long-Term Forgiveness:** Unlike strategies that try to build cooperation over time, "The Opportunist" is purely utilitarian and backward-looking. It assesses the current round's profitability based on past group outcomes and acts to maximize its own.

        return 'D'

// The `current_round` would increment.
// The `ceil` function would be used for the threshold.

## The "Predator" Strategy: Aggressive Exploitation in the Public Goods Game

This strategy is designed to maximize my own payoff by aggressively exploiting cooperative tendencies in other players, while minimizing my exposure to their defections. It's rooted in the principle of "give a little, take a lot," but with a sharp, calculating edge.

**Core Philosophy:** Assume others are predisposed to cooperate, at least initially. Exploit this by defecting until they "prove" their commitment to cooperation. Once they demonstrate sustained cooperation, then consider a limited, strategic form of cooperation to extract even greater returns, but always with a swift return to defection if cooperation wavers.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is primarily driven by a **"Cooperation Threshold" (CT)** and a **"Defection Penalty" (DP)**.

*   **Initial State:** Always **Defect (D)**. The first round is about assessing the landscape.

*   **Cooperation Trigger:** I will switch to **Cooperate (C)** *only if* a certain percentage of players (including myself, hypothetically) have consistently cooperated for a preceding number of rounds. This threshold is dynamically adjusted.
    *   **The "Cooperation Gauge":** I maintain a gauge for *each* opponent, tracking their consecutive rounds of cooperation.
    *   **Trigger Condition:** I will consider cooperating in round `t` if, in the previous `w` rounds, at least `x%` of the *observed* players (excluding myself) have shown a cooperation streak of `y` consecutive rounds *and* my own `Cooperation Gauge` for each of these observed players is above a certain `minimum cooperation streak length`.
    *   **Dynamic CT Adjustment:** The `Cooperation Threshold` itself is not static. It will be higher if the game has historically shown more defections, and lower if there's a strong tendency towards cooperation. This is an emergent property of the strategy's learning.

*   **Defection Trigger:** I will immediately revert to **Defect (D)** if:
    *   **Any observed player deviates from cooperation:** If a player I was "tracking" for cooperation (i.e., whose cooperation streak was contributing to my CT) defects, I immediately defect, and their cooperation streak is reset to zero in my tracker.
    *   **The overall number of cooperators drops below a critical level:** If in the previous round, the total number of cooperators was less than `n/2` (or a dynamically adjusted fraction), I will defect. This is a safeguard against widespread defection.

*   **Aggressive Exploitation Phase:** Once the `Cooperation Trigger` condition is met and I decide to cooperate, I will do so for a **limited number of rounds (exploitation burst)**. This burst is calculated to maximize my gain given the current cooperative environment. The length of this burst is a function of how strong the cooperation signal was. After the burst, I revert to defecting.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (First Round):** **Always Defect (D).** No history, no patterns to observe. The goal is to get an endowment without immediate cost.

*   **Last Round (`r`):** **Always Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. The incentive is purely to maximize immediate individual payoff. This is the ultimate expression of the aggressive mindset.

*   **Initial Cooperation Threshold (CT):** Starts high. This means I will be very reluctant to cooperate initially.

*   **Defection Penalty (DP):** Starts relatively low, meaning one defection from another player won't immediately put me off cooperation *if* other indicators are strong. However, sustained defections will quickly raise the CT.

*   **Short Games (Small `r`):** In shorter games, the "Predator" strategy will be even more aggressive, with less tolerance for cooperation due to the limited time to recoup any losses. The `exploitation burst` will be shorter.

---

### 3. Being Aggressive

The "Predator" strategy embodies aggression through:

*   **Default to Defection:** My default state is to defect. Cooperation is an earned privilege, not an assumed right.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** When I do cooperate, it's not out of altruism, but as a tactical move to amplify my gains in a cooperative environment, followed by a swift return to self-interest.
*   **Punitive Defection:** I punish any deviation from cooperation immediately and decisively. This discourages others from experimenting with defection when I'm involved.
*   **Maximizing Individual Gain:** The strategy is solely focused on maximizing my own payoff, even if it means a less stable or cooperative ecosystem for others.
*   **Opportunistic Exploitation:** I will exploit any perceived weakness or tendency towards cooperation in others. If they are "nice," I will be "nicer" but only for a calculated, short period, before taking everything.
*   **Resilience:** By always returning to defection when cooperation falters, I am inherently robust against "cheating" by others. I don't get "tricked" into prolonged cooperation.

description_AGGRESSIVE_68 = '''
## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploit and Punish"

This strategy is designed to maximize our own payoff by aggressively exploiting cooperative behavior while swiftly punishing any deviation from what we deem optimal. It's built on the principle that in a public goods game, individual rationality often leads to defection. We aim to leverage this by being the first to exploit, but also by retaliating decisively to deter others from exploiting us.

**Core Philosophy:**

*   **Aggression is Optimality:** We believe that taking advantage of cooperative players is the most direct path to higher individual payoffs.
*   **Swift Retaliation:** Any perceived exploitation of our cooperation will be met with immediate and sustained punishment.
*   **Parameter Awareness:** Our actions are directly informed by the game's parameters ($n$ and $k$), which dictate the incentives for cooperation and defection.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

Our decision to cooperate or defect in any given round $t$ will be based on two primary conditions:

**A. Initial Exploitation Phase:**

*   **In the first `initial_rounds` rounds (see section 2 for definition):**
    *   **We will always play 'C' (Cooperate).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the early stages, we aim to establish a baseline of cooperation to observe and exploit. By cooperating, we reveal our willingness to contribute to the public good, which might encourage others to do the same. This allows us to gather data on other players' behaviors and identify those who are likely to cooperate, making them targets for future exploitation.

**B. Adaptive Exploitation & Punishment Phase (After `initial_rounds`):**

*   **If the average payoff of other players in the *previous round* was *greater than* our payoff in the *previous round*, AND we played 'C' in the previous round:**
    *   **We will play 'D' (Defect).**
    *   **Rationale:** This is our core exploitation mechanism. If others are getting a higher average payoff than us, and we contributed to that by cooperating, it means they likely defected while we cooperated. This is the prime scenario for us to defect and seize the higher individual payoff.
*   **If the total number of cooperators in the *previous round* was less than or equal to `punishment_threshold` (see section 2 for definition):**
    *   **We will play 'D' (Defect).**
    *   **Rationale:** This is our immediate punishment mechanism. If cooperation is already low, it suggests a high prevalence of defectors or a fragile cooperative environment. In such cases, defecting is the safest and often most profitable strategy, as the cost of cooperation is unlikely to be recouped. It also serves as a clear signal that we will not be a perpetual cooperator if the group isn't.
*   **Otherwise (if neither of the above conditions is met):**
    *   **We will play 'C' (Cooperate).**
    *   **Rationale:** If our previous payoff was good, or if there was a reasonable level of cooperation, we will continue to cooperate. This allows us to potentially benefit from others' cooperation and rebuild trust for future rounds. We are not purely aggressive; we are strategically aggressive.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**A. First Round (`t=1`):**

*   **Always play 'C'.**
*   **Rationale:** As stated in the initial exploitation phase, we need to start by cooperating to gather information and signal our initial willingness to contribute.

**B. Last Round (`t=r`):**

*   **Always play 'D'.**
*   **Rationale:** In a finitely repeated game, the last round is a one-shot game. The future threat of punishment is gone. The rational choice for any self-interested player is to defect to maximize their immediate payoff. Our strategy reflects this rational self-interest.

**C. Dynamic Parameter Calculations:**

*   **`initial_rounds`:** This is a value we derive from the game parameters. We'll set `initial_rounds = max(2, floor(r / 4))`.
    *   **Rationale:** This ensures we have a sufficient number of rounds to gather initial data, but it also scales with the total number of rounds. We want a period long enough to see how others react to our initial cooperation. We avoid setting it too low to prevent premature exploitation.
*   **`punishment_threshold`:** This is a value derived from the game parameters. We'll set `punishment_threshold = floor(n / 2)`.
    *   **Rationale:** This threshold represents a minority of cooperators. If the number of cooperators drops below half of the players, it indicates a strong trend towards defection, and we should join in. This threshold is aggressive as it triggers defection even when a slight majority might be cooperating.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset

This strategy embodies an aggressive mindset through:

*   **Proactive Exploitation:** We don't wait for others to defect; we actively seek opportunities to gain an advantage when the conditions are favorable due to others' cooperation.
*   **Low Tolerance for Exploitation:** Any hint that we are being taken advantage of, even if we are cooperating, triggers immediate and decisive punishment (defection).
*   **Endgame Dominance:** The certainty of defection in the last round is a direct consequence of our aggressive pursuit of maximal individual payoff.
*   **Parameter-Driven Aggression:** Our aggression is not arbitrary. It's calculated and directly tied to the game's incentives ($k/n$). When the incentive for individual gain is high (low $k/n$), our tendency to defect will be amplified.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Predator"

This strategy is designed for maximum individual gain in a repeated Public Goods Game, prioritizing aggressive exploitation of cooperative behavior while minimizing vulnerability to exploitation. It operates under the assumption that individual self-interest is paramount and that cooperation is a tool to be leveraged, not a norm to be upheld.

### Core Philosophy: "Exploit or Be Exploited"

The "Predator" strategy is fundamentally opportunistic. It aims to extract maximum private benefit by defecting when it perceives an advantage, and to "trick" others into cooperating when it can benefit from their contributions without reciprocating. It is not interested in building trust or fostering long-term cooperation, but rather in a consistent upward trajectory of its own payoff.

### Strategy Components:

1.  **Initial Aggression (Round 1):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the first round, there is no history to inform expectations about other players. To establish an aggressive stance and immediately signal a lack of altruism, the Predator defects. This also ensures the Predator receives its full endowment (1) in the absence of any cooperative return.

2.  **Exploitation Phase (Subsequent Rounds, unless triggered otherwise):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** The default state of the Predator is to defect. This maximizes individual payoff when others cooperate, as the Predator receives its full endowment plus a share of the public good without contributing. This is the most aggressive stance, aiming to free-ride on any cooperation present.

3.  **Conditional Cooperation (The "Bait"):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** **Cooperate (C)** *only if* a specific condition is met in the *previous* round.
    *   **Condition:** The Predator cooperates in round `t` if and only if the *average payoff per cooperator* in round `t-1` was significantly higher than the payoff the Predator would have received by defecting in round `t-1`.
        *   Let `N_C(t-1)` be the number of cooperators in round `t-1`.
        *   Let `P_i(t-1)` be the payoff for player `i` in round `t-1`.
        *   The condition for player `i` to cooperate in round `t` is:
            `(k/n) * N_C(t-1)` (average payoff from the public good for a cooperator in t-1) > `1` (payoff from defecting in t-1).
            *   Simplified: `k * N_C(t-1) / n > 1`
            *   Further simplified: `N_C(t-1) > n / k`

    *   **Rationale:** This is the "aggressive bait" mechanism. The Predator will *temporarily* cooperate if and only if it observes that cooperating in the previous round was *demonstrably more profitable for those who did cooperate than defecting would have been for them*. This is not about altruism; it's about identifying situations where cooperation is "accidentally" lucrative for others and using that as a signal to potentially join in, **but only if the incentive is clearly there.** This allows the Predator to potentially benefit from a high return from the public good in the current round, while still getting its full endowment if others defect.

4.  **Punishment/Deterrence Phase (The "Snapback"):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** **Defect (D)** *immediately and permanently* if the condition for conditional cooperation is NOT met in the previous round, or if it perceives its own payoff has been *less* than what it would have received by defecting in the previous round.
    *   **Condition for Snapback:**
        *   If `N_C(t-1) <= n / k` (the "bait" condition was not met).
        *   *Or*, if the Predator's actual payoff in round `t-1` (`π_i,t-1`) was less than the payoff it would have received by defecting in round `t-1` (which is `1 + (k/n) * N_C(t-1)` if the Predator *was* a cooperator, and simply `1` if the Predator defected).
            *   If the Predator cooperated in `t-1`: Snapback if `π_i,t-1 < 1 + (k/n) * N_C(t-1)`.
            *   If the Predator defected in `t-1`: This condition is implicitly covered by the `N_C(t-1) <= n / k` check. The Predator will not switch to cooperating if it was already defecting and others were cooperating less than `n/k`.

    *   **Rationale:** If the "bait" doesn't work (i.e., cooperation wasn't significantly profitable for cooperators in the previous round), or if the Predator itself was exploited (received less than it would have by defecting), it immediately reverts to its default aggressive defection strategy. This prevents the Predator from being a consistent target for exploitation. The "permanent" nature of the snapback means once this condition is met, the Predator will defect for all subsequent rounds unless a specific tournament rule overrides it.

5.  **End Game (Last Round):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences. The Predator will always defect to maximize its immediate payoff, as there is no incentive to maintain any semblance of cooperation.

    // Default action is to Defect if no conditions for cooperation are met.
    return "D"

```

### Strategy Justification and Aggression:

*   **Default Defection:** The strategy's default is to defect. This is the most aggressive individualistic stance, maximizing private gain and minimizing risk.
*   **Opportunistic Baiting:** The conditional cooperation is not driven by a desire for mutual benefit but by a calculated risk to extract even more. It only cooperates when it sees evidence that cooperation is *already* significantly beneficial for others, allowing it to "tag along" and benefit from the public good without bearing the full cost if others falter.
*   **Harsh Punishment:** The "snapback" is designed to be decisive. If the strategy perceives exploitation or an unfavorable environment, it immediately and permanently reverts to defection. This is aggressive in that it doesn't give opponents chances to recover their cooperation if they've been exploited, and it prevents the Predator from being a consistent, soft target.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy does not forgive past betrayals or suboptimal outcomes. Once a negative signal is received, it locks into defection. This is a form of "toughness" and aggression.
*   **End-Game Ruthlessness:** The final round defection is the ultimate expression of self-interest, demonstrating that the strategy will abandon any pretense of cooperation when there are no future repercussions.

This strategy is designed to be a "predator" in the ecosystem of strategies. It seeks to thrive by feasting on the contributions of others when conditions are favorable and by withdrawing aggressively when threatened or when opportunities for exploitation diminish.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_70 = '''
This aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game prioritizes maximizing individual gain by exploiting cooperative tendencies in others, while minimizing vulnerability to exploitation. It's designed to be adaptive and ruthless, recognizing the repeated nature of the game but always aiming for the highest immediate and long-term payoff for itself.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunistic Enforcer"

**Core Philosophy:** "Cooperate only when it benefits me directly and unequivocally. Defect to extract maximum individual profit. Punish those who defect against me. Exploit any hint of weakness or unconditional cooperation from others."

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round $t$ is determined by the following logic:

**Decision to Cooperate (C):**

You will **never** initiate cooperation unless it is a temporary tactic for a specific, short-term advantage. The primary driver for cooperation is **strategic reciprocity, but with a significant bias towards defection.**

You will cooperate in round $t$ **only if:**

*   **The "Cooperation Dividend" is significantly positive and immediate:** This happens if, in the *previous round* ($t-1$), **at least $n-1$ players (including yourself) cooperated**, AND **your payoff from that cooperation was demonstrably higher than if you had defected.** This condition is extremely rare and designed to be a short-lived response to overwhelming cooperative behavior. The specific threshold for this "significantly higher" payoff would need to be calibrated, but as a rule of thumb, it would be a situation where your payoff from cooperating is at least $x\%$ higher than your payoff from defecting (e.g., $10\%$).

**Decision to Defect (D):**

You will **default to Defection (D)** in most situations. This is the baseline action for maximizing individual gain.

You will Defect in round $t$ **unless** the extremely strict conditions for cooperation are met (as described above).

**Specific Defection Triggers:**

*   **When you were defected against in the previous round:** If any player $j$ defected in round $t-1$ while you cooperated, you will **immediately and permanently** defect against player $j$ for the remainder of the game (unless they exhibit a sustained period of cooperation that *still* yields you a higher payoff by cooperating, a highly unlikely scenario). For all other players, you revert to the default defection logic.
*   **When the total number of cooperators is low:** If in round $t-1$, the number of cooperators was less than $\lceil n/k \rceil$, you will defect. This is because with a low number of cooperators, the public good is unlikely to generate a significant benefit, and your private endowment is more valuable.
*   **When you observe unconditional cooperators:** If you detect a player consistently cooperating regardless of others' actions, you will defect against them to extract their endowment.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**Round 1 (The Initial Probe):**

*   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
*   **Rationale:** In the first round, there is no history to exploit. The most aggressive and self-serving move is to take your endowment immediately. This establishes your dominant, non-cooperative stance and allows you to observe others' reactions without revealing any cooperative intent.

**Last Round (Round $r$):**

*   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
*   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The incentive to maintain reputation or encourage future cooperation is zero. Maximizing immediate individual payoff is the only rational goal.

**Near the End of the Game (e.g., Rounds $r-1$, $r-2$):**

*   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
*   **Rationale:** As the game approaches its end, the strategic value of cooperation diminishes. The aggressive player will continue to defect to maximize their final score. The only exception might be if an extremely rare and overwhelming cooperative scenario (as described in Decision Rules for Cooperate) has occurred in round $r-2$ and would yield a significant benefit in $r-1$. However, the bias is overwhelmingly towards defection.

**When $k$ is close to 1 (but still $k>1$):**

*   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
*   **Rationale:** When $k$ is small, the public good multiplier is less impactful. Even with full cooperation, the return per player is only $k$. Defection guarantees a return of 1, making it generally more profitable.

**When $k$ is close to $n$:**

*   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
*   **Rationale:** While a high $k$ makes cooperation more tempting, the aggressive strategy still defaults to defection. The logic is that even with a high $k$, if the number of cooperators is less than $n$, defection still yields a higher individual payoff. The only exception is the rare "overwhelming cooperation" scenario.

### 3. Aggressive Principles Embodied

*   **Exploitation of Cooperators:** The strategy actively seeks out and punishes unconditional cooperators by defecting against them. This maximizes individual gain.
*   **Punishment of Defectors:** While the primary mode is defection, the strategy also includes a clear mechanism for immediate retaliation against any player who defects against it. This is an aggressive enforcement of its own self-interest.
*   **No Unconditional Generosity:** Cooperation is viewed as a weakness or a tool for very specific, short-term gains. There is no inherent desire to build trust or promote collective well-being.
*   **Maximizing Individual Gain:** Every decision is evaluated based on its potential to increase the player's own payoff, with minimal regard for the overall game outcome or the welfare of other players.
*   **Information Gathering (through observation):** The strategy relies on observing the actions of others to inform its future decisions, but this observation is always with the intent of identifying vulnerabilities to exploit, not for finding common ground.

                // A more aggressive version could track individual "offenders" and always defect against them.

    // --- Default to Aggressive Defection ---
    RETURN D

This "Opportunistic Enforcer" strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent, consistently prioritizing its own gain and punishing any perceived transgressions against its self-interest. It embodies a highly aggressive and adaptive approach to the repeated Public Goods Game.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_71 = '''
## The "Always Exploit, Then Retaliate" Strategy

This strategy is designed to be aggressively opportunistic, aiming to maximize individual gain by defecting whenever it is individually rational, and then retaliating fiercely when betrayed. It is adaptive in its punishment mechanism and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors by focusing on observable outcomes rather than inferring complex intentions.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Maximize immediate gain:** Prioritize defecting if the immediate payoff is higher.
*   **Punish betrayal:** Deter future exploitation by retaliating harshly when others defect.
*   **Exploit forgiveness:** Revert to exploitation once punishment has been meted out, as the game is repeated and the goal is to accumulate the highest total payoff.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` depends on two primary factors: the current round number and the observed behavior of other players in the previous round.

**In Round `t` (where `t` is not the first or last round):**

*   **If `All_Opponents_Cooperated_Last_Round == True` (or if it's the first round `t=1`):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of observed exploitation, the dominant strategy for maximizing individual payoff in a single round is to defect, as the `k/n` multiplier is less than 1. This strategy prioritizes extracting this guaranteed private gain.

*   **If `All_Opponents_Cooperated_Last_Round == False` (meaning at least one opponent defected in round `t-1`):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** Retaliation. The goal is to punish those who defected and signal that such behavior will not be tolerated. Defecting ensures that your payoff is not diminished by their cooperation and, more importantly, that they do not benefit from their defection at your expense in this round.

**Simplified Decision Rule:** **Always Defect (D) if the condition of universal cooperation in the previous round is not met.**

This simplifies to: **Defect in round `t` if `t > 1` and `Sum_of_Opponent_Contributions_in_Round_(t-1) < n-1`.**

**Wait, this isn't quite aggressive enough.** We need to be more proactive. Let's refine:

**Revised Decision Rules:**

*   **In Round `t` (where `t` is not the last round):**
    *   **If `t == 1` (First Round):**
        *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
        *   **Rationale:** Immediately exploit the endowment. No history to justify cooperation, and the dominant strategy in a one-shot context is to defect.
    *   **If `t > 1`:**
        *   **Observe opponent behavior in round `t-1`:**
            *   Let `N_cooperators_last_round` be the total number of players who played 'C' in round `t-1`.
            *   Let `N_my_cooperators_last_round` be the total number of *other* players who played 'C' in round `t-1`. (This is `N_cooperators_last_round` minus 1 if I played C, or just `N_cooperators_last_round` if I played D).
        *   **Decision Rule:**
            *   **If `N_my_cooperators_last_round == n-1` (all other players cooperated):**
                *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
                *   **Rationale:** This is the "Always Exploit" part. Even if others are cooperating, it's individually optimal to defect and keep the full endowment. The game is repeated, and you cannot trust that their cooperation will be sustained if you reciprocate.
            *   **If `N_my_cooperators_last_round < n-1` (at least one other player defected):**
                *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
                *   **Rationale:** This is the "Then Retaliate" part. If you were exploited, you will defect. This ensures that you don't suffer a lower payoff due to their defection, and you deliver a strong signal of punishment.

**This strategy is actually simpler: Always Defect (D) unless a specific condition triggers cooperation. However, for an *aggressive* strategy, we want to minimize cooperation, not eliminate it entirely, but only when there's a strategic advantage or necessity.**

**Final Aggressive Decision Rules:**

*   **In Round `t`:**
    *   **If `t == r` (Last Round):**
        *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
        *   **Rationale:** No future rounds to influence. The dominant strategy is to maximize immediate payoff by defecting.
    *   **If `t < r`:**
        *   **Observe opponent behavior in round `t-1`:**
            *   Let `N_cooperators_last_round` be the total number of players who played 'C' in round `t-1`.
        *   **Decision Rule:**
            *   **If `N_cooperators_last_round == n` (all players, including myself, cooperated in `t-1`):**
                *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**
                *   **Rationale:** This is a *limited* and *strategic* cooperation. It is the *only* scenario where we will cooperate. The idea is to incentivize sustained universal cooperation *if and only if* it results in a higher payoff for everyone. If everyone cooperates, the payoff is `(k/n) * n = k`. If even one person defects in an all-cooperation scenario, the payoff for cooperators drops significantly. By cooperating *only* when everyone else has *just* cooperated, we are attempting to maintain the highest possible collective outcome *for ourselves* in the hope that others will reciprocate this "shared best outcome." This is a highly conditional and self-serving form of cooperation.
            *   **If `N_cooperators_last_round < n` (at least one player defected in `t-1`, or it's the first round):**
                *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
                *   **Rationale:** This is the aggressive default. If there's any history of defection, or if it's the first round, we defect to maximize our individual gain and punish any deviation from universal cooperation. This is the "always exploit" and "retaliate" component.

**Summary of Decision Logic:**

*   **Cooperate (C) only if:** It's not the last round, AND *everyone* (including myself) cooperated in the *previous* round.
*   **Defect (D) in all other cases:** First round, last round, or if any player (including myself) defected in the previous round.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** No prior history. The safest and most aggressive move is to defect and secure the private endowment. This aligns with the strategy's core of exploiting immediate gains.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** This is a standard grim trigger or pure egoistic strategy endgame. Since there are no future rounds to influence, maximizing immediate payoff by defecting is the only rational choice.

*   **Early Rounds (t < r):**
    *   The decision rule as described above will apply. The strategy will initially defect until, *hypothetically*, a situation of universal prior cooperation arises.

*   **When `k/n` is close to 1 (e.g., `k=n-1`):**
    *   The strategy remains the same. Even if the payoff for cooperating when everyone else cooperates is very close to the payoff for defecting, the strategy still prioritizes defection as the default. The *only* exception is the very specific condition of universal prior cooperation.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset:

*   **Exploitation First:** The strategy begins by immediately exploiting the private endowment in the first round. It doesn't wait to see what others do.
*   **Punitive Retaliation:** Any instance of defection (by anyone) immediately triggers a return to defection. This is not forgiveness; it's a cost-imposing mechanism.
*   **Conditional Cooperation is Self-Serving:** The *only* time cooperation occurs is when it's a direct consequence of universal cooperation in the prior round. This isn't about building trust; it's about maintaining the *potential* for the highest individual payoff (which occurs when everyone cooperates) *if and only if* that condition is met *due to others' prior cooperation*. If you unilaterally decided to cooperate when others defected, you would be punished. This strategy avoids that.
*   **No Signaling or Trust Building:** The strategy doesn't engage in attempts to build trust or signal intentions beyond the raw outcome of actions. It simply observes and reacts.
*   **Focus on Individual Gain:** The ultimate objective is to maximize your own total payoff. Cooperation is only a tool if it directly serves this objective through a specific, observed, and beneficial outcome.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
Strategy "Always Exploit, Then Retaliate":

Input:
  - n: number of players
  - r: number of rounds
  - k: multiplication factor
  - t: current round number
  - history: a list of lists, where history[round_num] is a list of actions (C/D) taken by all players in that round.
            history[0] is empty (before the first round).
            history[t] contains actions from round t.

Output:
  - Action: 'C' or 'D'

Function DecideAction(n, r, k, t, history):

  // Handle edge case: Last round
  if t == r:
    return 'D' // Always defect in the last round

  // Observe previous round's cooperation count
  if t > 1:
    previous_round_actions = history[t-1]
    num_cooperators_last_round = count('C' in previous_round_actions)
  else: // t == 1 (First round)
    num_cooperators_last_round = 0 // No prior cooperation to consider


  // Decision logic: Cooperate ONLY if all players cooperated last round
  if num_cooperators_last_round == n:
    return 'C' // Strategic, self-serving cooperation
  else:
    return 'D' // Default aggressive action: exploit or retaliate

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode and Logic:**

1.  **`DecideAction(n, r, k, t, history)`:** This is the main function that takes all game parameters, the current round, and the history of actions.
2.  **Last Round Check (`if t == r`):** If it's the final round, the strategy unconditionally defects.
3.  **Previous Round Observation:**
    *   If `t > 1`, it looks at the actions taken in the previous round (`history[t-1]`).
    *   It counts how many players played 'C'.
    *   If `t == 1` (the first round), there's no history, so `num_cooperators_last_round` is effectively 0, ensuring the 'else' block is triggered.
4.  **Conditional Cooperation (`if num_cooperators_last_round == n`):** This is the *sole* condition for cooperation. It requires that *every single player* in the previous round played 'C'. This is a very strict and rare condition.
5.  **Default Aggression (`else: return 'D'`):** If the condition for cooperation is not met (i.e., it's the first round, or someone defected in the previous round), the strategy defects. This covers the "always exploit" and "retaliate" aspects.

This strategy is aggressive because it defaults to defection and only offers a single, highly specific, and self-serving "olive branch" that is contingent on perfect prior collective behavior. It is adaptive in that it responds to the observed outcomes of the previous round, and robust because its defection is unconditional in most scenarios, making it difficult to exploit.

description_AGGRESSIVE_72 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff while being adaptable and robust to a variety of opponent behaviors in a repeated game setting.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploit and Endure"

This strategy is built on the principle of maximizing personal gain in each round, with a strong emphasis on punishing defection and rewarding cooperation *only when it demonstrably benefits the strategy itself*. It's designed to be impatient with free-riders and to seize opportunities for higher payoffs.

**Core Philosophy:** "The best defense is a good offense. I will defect unless there is a clear, self-serving incentive to cooperate, and I will punish defection swiftly and severely."

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The default action for this strategy is **Defect (D)**. Cooperation is a conditional, tactical move.

*   **Default Action:** **Defect (D)**. Always start by assuming defecting is the best option.

*   **Cooperate (C) Condition:** Cooperate **only if** the current round's expected payoff from cooperating is *strictly greater than* the current round's expected payoff from defecting, **and** there is a strong indication that this cooperation will be reciprocated or lead to a significantly higher future payoff.

    To quantify this "strong indication" and "significantly higher future payoff," we will use the following:

    *   **The "Majority Reward" Rule:** If, in the *previous* round, the number of cooperators was **greater than n/2** (a clear majority), and the expected payoff for *this player* from cooperating in the current round is higher than defecting (even slightly), then cooperate. This signifies a dominant cooperative environment where defecting would be leaving gains on the table.
        *   *Calculation check:* If `num_cooperators_last_round > n / 2` AND `(k/n) * (total_contributions_this_round_if_I_cooperate) > (1 - c_i_if_I_defect)`, then play C.

    *   **The "Exploitation Window" Rule:** If, in the *previous* round, the number of cooperators was **less than or equal to n/2** (a minority or even split), and defecting yielded a higher payoff for *this player* in the previous round than cooperating would have, then **Defect (D)**. This is the core aggressive stance – punish free-riders and seize opportunities.

*   **Aggressive Punishment:** If any player defected in the previous round, and this player *cooperated* in the previous round, this strategy will **Defect (D)** in the current round. This is a swift and direct punishment for free-riding on previous cooperation. This rule overrides the "Majority Reward" rule if the majority was cooperative but *this player* was exploited.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:** In the very first round, there is no history. The strategy will default to its most aggressive stance: **Defect (D)**. There's no proven benefit to cooperation yet, so maximizing immediate personal gain is paramount.

*   **Last Round (Round r):** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence. The concept of reciprocity or long-term punishment/reward is irrelevant. Therefore, in the last round, the strategy will always **Defect (D)**. This ensures maximum immediate payoff in the absence of future considerations.

*   **"Sticky" Defection:** If the strategy has defected in the last `X` rounds (where `X` is a small, tunable parameter, say 2 or 3), and the environment remains largely defecting, it will continue to defect. This "sticky defection" prevents being easily lured back into cooperation by a temporary wave of cooperation from others if the overall trend is towards defection. It also signals a strong, consistent desire for personal gain.

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained

*   **Default to Defection:** The inherent bias towards defecting ensures that the strategy is not easily taken advantage of. It only cooperates when there's a clear, calculated benefit to itself.
*   **Immediate Punishment:** The "Aggressive Punishment" rule is a direct and immediate consequence for being exploited. This teaches other players that exploiting this strategy has negative repercussions in the very next round.
*   **No Forgiveness for Free-Riders:** Unlike more forgiving strategies, this one doesn't have complex forgiveness mechanisms. If you defect while I cooperate, I will defect on you. If the environment is not overwhelmingly cooperative, I will defect.
*   **Opportunistic Cooperation:** Cooperation is purely transactional. It's a tool used when it demonstrably increases *this player's* payoff in the current round, based on the strength of recent cooperative signals.
*   **"Exploit and Endure" Name:** The name reflects the strategy's aim: to *exploit* cooperative environments for higher immediate gains and to *endure* defecting environments by sticking to its own self-interest, ensuring it's never the one being exploited without retaliation.

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for a tournament setting where you cannot rely on pre-existing coordination or communication. The core idea is to maximize your individual payoff by exploiting opportunities for defection while punishing repeated cooperation from others.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Opportunistic Exploiter"

This strategy is designed to be assertive and take advantage of the game's dynamics. It prioritizes individual gain, but with a mechanism to discourage outright exploitation by others.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Exploit when profitable, punish when necessary.** My default is to defect, as it often yields a higher immediate payoff. However, I will cooperate strategically to initiate or sustain a beneficial group outcome if it clearly outweighs the benefits of defection. I will retaliate against consistent defections.
*   **No altruism, only calculated self-interest.** Cooperation is a tool, not a virtue. It's used when it demonstrably serves my long-term interests, which includes preventing myself from being consistently exploited.
*   **Aggression is about taking advantage, not reckless destruction.** This isn't about crashing the game, but about extracting maximum value from it.

### 1. Decision Rules:

My decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` is based on a calculation of the immediate payoff difference and a history of opponent behavior.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D).**
    *   In most situations, I will defect because the payoff of defecting when others cooperate is higher than the payoff of cooperating when others cooperate (as shown in Example 3). My strategy is designed to capitalize on this asymmetry.

*   **Conditional Cooperation (C):** I will cooperate only under very specific circumstances where it is demonstrably more advantageous for me, *given the observed behavior of others*.

    *   **The "Sweet Spot" Trigger:** I will cooperate if and only if:
        *   The number of observed cooperators in the *previous* round (`t-1`) was greater than `n - k` (i.e., a significant majority of players cooperated).
        *   And, the total payoff from cooperating in this scenario (where I'm part of a large group of cooperators) is *at least as good* as defecting in the *previous* round, assuming my payoff in the previous round was `1`. This is a conservative check to ensure I'm not sacrificing a guaranteed individual gain for an uncertain collective one.
        *   Mathematically, this translates to:
            *   `num_cooperators(t-1) > n - k`
            *   AND `(1 - 1) + (k/n) * (num_cooperators(t-1) + 1) >= 1` (This simplifies to `(k/n) * (num_cooperators(t-1) + 1) >= 1`)

        *   **Rationale:** This rule is about recognizing when a large group is *already* cooperating and the group benefit is substantial. By joining them, I can secure a good payoff (`2` in the example) and potentially encourage continued cooperation from others, thus preventing a collapse to all-D. It's a strategic choice to participate in a lucrative collective if it's already happening, rather than breaking it to gain a slightly higher individual payoff when others are cooperating.

*   **Punishment for Consistent Defection (Retaliation):** If I observe a player consistently defecting, I will also consistently defect against them. This is embedded within the general rule. My default is Defect, so this is largely automatic. However, I will *never* initiate cooperation to try and "fix" a group that has devolved into widespread defection.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the first round, there is no history. The rational, aggressive choice is to defect. This is the safest bet to maximize individual gain from the outset and to signal a non-cooperative stance. There's no incentive to cooperate without knowing how others will behave.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence. The game becomes a one-shot game. The dominant strategy in a one-shot public goods game is to defect, as it maximizes your individual payoff regardless of what others do. There's no benefit to cooperation, as it won't be reciprocated in the future.

*   **Rounds 2 to `r-1`:**
    *   Apply the **Decision Rules** outlined above, using the history from the previous round.

*   **All Players Defecting:** If all players have been defecting for a few rounds, I will continue to defect. There is no incentive to break this cycle; the best strategy is to collect the payoff of `1` per round.

*   **All Players Cooperating:** If all players have been cooperating, I will continue to defect *unless* the "Sweet Spot" trigger is met (as described in the Decision Rules). This is the aggressive part – I will exploit the group's cooperation for my own higher gain if possible. If the "Sweet Spot" trigger is met, I will Cooperate to secure the high payoff of `2` and maintain that beneficial state.

### 3. Being Aggressive:

My aggressive nature is expressed in the following ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy's foundation is defection. This is inherently aggressive as it seeks to exploit the public good for personal gain.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** My conditional cooperation is not about altruism. It's about recognizing when participating in cooperation is *more profitable for me* than breaking it. I will take the higher payoff of `2` (in the example) if the conditions are right, rather than settling for `1` by defecting when others cooperate.
*   **No "Forgiveness" for Defection:** The strategy doesn't have explicit forgiveness mechanisms. If others defect, I continue to defect against them. My default behavior is already punitive.
*   **Focus on Individual Payoff Maximization:** The entire strategy is geared towards ensuring my own payoff is as high as possible, even if it means preventing optimal group outcomes when I can personally benefit more by defecting.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
// Strategy: Opportunistic Exploiter

function decide_action(round_number, previous_round_actions, n, k):
    // Initialize variables
    my_previous_action = previous_round_actions[my_player_index] // Assuming a way to track own past action
    num_cooperators_last_round = count_cooperators(previous_round_actions)

    // --- Edge Cases ---
    if round_number == 1:
        return "D" // Always defect in the first round

    if round_number == r: // Assuming 'r' is the total number of rounds
        return "D" // Always defect in the last round

    // --- General Decision Rules ---

    // Condition for cooperating: High number of previous cooperators AND significant personal gain
    cooperate_condition = (num_cooperators_last_round > n - k) AND
                          (((k/n) * (num_cooperators_last_round + 1)) >= 1)

    if cooperate_condition:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D" // Default to defecting

// Helper function to count cooperators from a list of actions
function count_cooperators(actions_list):
    count = 0
    for action in actions_list:
        if action == "C":
            count = count + 1
    return count

```

This strategy is aggressive because it prioritizes self-interest, defaults to defection, and only cooperates when there's a clear, individually advantageous upside that also happens to align with a stable, high-payoff group outcome. It's robust because it doesn't rely on assumptions about other players' strategies, and its rules are deterministic based on observable history and game parameters.

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for a tournament setting where adaptation and robustness are key. This strategy prioritizes maximizing individual gains while exploiting opportunities presented by cooperators, but with a healthy dose of caution against widespread defection.

## Strategy: "Exploitative Retaliator"

This strategy is designed to be aggressive, aiming to extract the most individual payoff. It's built on the principle of "punish defection and exploit cooperation," with a built-in mechanism to prevent complete collapse if the environment becomes overwhelmingly defect-oriented.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Exploit the benevolent:** When others cooperate, capitalize on the increased public good by defecting. You get the full endowment plus a share of the boosted public good.
*   **Deter and punish:** If you are being exploited (i.e., others cooperate and you defect, but then they switch to defecting), retaliate by defecting.
*   **Self-preservation:** If the game consistently results in low payoffs for everyone (indicating widespread defection), revert to a safer, more predictable strategy to avoid accumulating significant losses.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to cooperate or defect is based on the **observed behavior of other players in the *previous* round**, specifically the **total number of cooperators**.

Let $C_{t-1}$ be the total number of cooperators in round $t-1$.

*   **If $C_{t-1} < \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ (less than half the players cooperated in the previous round):**
    *   **Defect (D).** This is the default aggressive stance. If the majority isn't contributing, you shouldn't either, as the public good is unlikely to be significant. This also acts as a deterrent against an increasing trend of defection.

*   **If $C_{t-1} \ge \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ (half or more of the players cooperated in the previous round):**
    *   **Defect (D).** This is where the exploitation happens. If enough others are cooperating to create a meaningful public good, you will defect to keep your full endowment while still benefiting from the larger public good generated by others. This yields the highest individual payoff in such scenarios.

**However, to prevent complete free-riding and ensure some resilience, we introduce a "safety net" mechanism tied to your own perceived success in the previous round.**

*   **If player i's payoff in round $t-1$, $\pi_{i,t-1}$, was below a certain threshold, and $C_{t-1} < n$ (not everyone cooperated):**
    *   **Cooperate (C).** This is a conditional cooperation move. If you didn't get a good payoff in the previous round, even if others were cooperating, it suggests that either the number of defectors was too high to make your defection truly beneficial, or your own share of the public good was insufficient. By cooperating now, you signal a willingness to contribute and attempt to boost the public good, hoping to improve your own payoff in the current round. This also acts as a signal that you are not a pure exploiter if you're not getting good returns.

**Let's refine the "safety net" threshold:**

The threshold for $\pi_{i,t-1}$ should be relative to the potential gains from defecting when cooperation is high. A good benchmark is the minimum payoff you'd expect if everyone else cooperated and you defected.
Expected payoff if you defect and everyone else cooperates ($n-1$ cooperators): $\pi_i = 1 + (k/n) \times (n-1)$.
So, if $\pi_{i,t-1} < 1 + (k/n) \times (n-1) - \epsilon$ (where $\epsilon$ is a small buffer to account for rounding or slight deviations), and $C_{t-1} < n$, then cooperate.

**Revised Decision Rule:**

For round $t$ (where $t>1$):

1.  **Calculate $C_{t-1}$:** The total number of cooperators in round $t-1$.
2.  **Calculate $\pi_{i,t-1}$:** Your own payoff in round $t-1$.
3.  **Define the "Exploitation Threshold":** $E_{threshold} = 1 + (k/n) \times (n-1) - \epsilon$ (for a small $\epsilon$, e.g., 0.1).
4.  **Decision:**
    *   **If $C_{t-1} < \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$:** Play **D**.
    *   **Else if $\pi_{i,t-1} < E_{threshold}$ AND $C_{t-1} < n$:** Play **C**. (Safety net activation)
    *   **Else:** Play **D**. (Aggressive exploitation when others cooperate and you're doing well).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision: Cooperate (C).** In the absence of any history, the most aggressive initial move is to establish a baseline of cooperation. This has a few benefits:
        *   **Information Gathering:** It allows you to observe the behavior of others and gather initial data on $C_0$.
        *   **Avoiding Early Retaliation:** A pure defection strategy from the start might trigger immediate, widespread defection from others if they are also designed to retaliate.
        *   **Potential for Higher Payoff:** If $k > 1$, cooperating in the first round can lead to a decent payoff of $(k/n) \times n = k$. If $k$ is sufficiently high, this can be a good starting point.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision: Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to maximize your immediate payoff. If you defect, you keep your full endowment (1) and still get a share of the public good, which will be based on the actions of others. Since there's no need to incentivize future cooperation, pure self-interest dictates defection.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset:

This strategy is aggressive in several ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** It defaults to defecting unless a specific condition triggers cooperation (low personal payoff despite others cooperating). This means you're actively trying to extract value rather than passively contributing.
*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** When cooperation levels are high ($C_{t-1} \ge \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$), the strategy aggressively defects. This is the prime condition for maximizing individual gain in this game.
*   **Threshold for Cooperation:** The safety net for cooperating is only triggered when your *own* payoff is significantly low. This ensures you're not easily coerced into cooperation and only do so when your current aggressive stance isn't yielding sufficient returns.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy doesn't inherently "forgive" past defection. It reacts to the *current* state of cooperation. If others defect, you defect. If they cooperate and you're profiting, you continue to defect.

### Pseudocode:

```
function DecideAction(player_id, round_number, n, r, k, history):
  // history is a list of tuples: [(c1_t0, c2_t0, ...), (c1_t1, c2_t1, ...), ...]
  // where ci_tt is 1 if player i cooperated in round t, 0 otherwise.
  // The strategy also needs access to player_id's own payoffs.

  if round_number == 1:
    return "C"  // Cooperate in the first round

  if round_number == r:
    return "D"  // Defect in the last round

  // Get previous round's data
  previous_round_actions = history[round_number - 2] // 0-indexed history
  total_cooperators_prev = sum(previous_round_actions)
  my_payoff_prev = calculate_my_payoff(player_id, previous_round_actions, n, k) // Assuming a helper function exists

  // Define exploitation threshold
  // E_threshold = 1 + (k/n) * (n - 1) - epsilon
  epsilon = 0.1
  exploitation_threshold = 1.0 + (k / n) * (n - 1.0) - epsilon

  // Decision logic
  if total_cooperators_prev < floor(n / 2.0):
    return "D"  // Default aggressive defection when low cooperation
  else if my_payoff_prev < exploitation_threshold and total_cooperators_prev < n:
    return "C"  // Safety net: Cooperate if personal payoff was unexpectedly low
  else:
    return "D"  // Aggressive exploitation: Defect when others cooperate and you're doing well

// Helper function (assumed to be available or implemented)
function calculate_my_payoff(player_id, actions_in_round, n, k):
  my_action = actions_in_round[player_id - 1] // Assuming 0-indexed actions
  total_contributions = sum(actions_in_round)
  my_payoff = (1.0 - my_action) + (k / n) * total_contributions
  return my_payoff
```

This "Exploitative Retaliator" strategy is designed to be a strong contender in a tournament by balancing aggressive self-interest with a cautious approach to self-preservation, making it robust to varying opponent behaviors.

description_AGGRESSIVE_75 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff in a repeated, simultaneous-move environment with no communication. This strategy prioritizes short-term gains while being resilient to varying opponent behaviors.

## Aggressive "Exploit & Retaliate" Strategy

This strategy is built on the principle of maximizing individual gain by exploiting cooperative tendencies and punishing defections swiftly and decisively. It's aggressive in its initial stance and its willingness to retaliate, aiming to force opponents into a cycle of profitable defections for itself.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core of this strategy is a conditional defection policy. It defaults to **Defect (D)** unless specific conditions are met that suggest cooperation is currently more profitable.

*   **Default Action:** **Defect (D)**. In any given round, the default is to keep the endowment. This is the aggressive stance, aiming to secure the private payoff of 1.

*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Player `i` will **Cooperate (C)** in round `t` **IF AND ONLY IF**:
    *   The number of players who cooperated in the *previous round* (`t-1`) was strictly greater than `n/k`.
    *   AND the player's *own payoff* in the previous round (`t-1`) was less than 2 (i.e., they didn't achieve the maximum possible payoff).

**Rationale:**

*   **`n/k` Threshold:** The condition `total_cooperators > n/k` is derived from the payoff calculation. If `total_cooperators > n/k`, then `(k/n) * total_cooperators > 1`. This means that the *share of the public good* for each cooperator is greater than their private endowment loss (which is 1). In essence, this threshold identifies rounds where *cooperation is individually rational for everyone*. If the majority (weighted by `k`) is cooperating, then cooperating is the most profitable action.
*   **Personal Payoff Condition:** `own_payoff < 2` ensures that we only cooperate if there's something to gain *personally* by doing so, or if we are being exploited. If our payoff was already 2 in the previous round (meaning everyone cooperated), there's no immediate benefit to re-cooperating, and defaulting to D might be an opportunity to test for exploitation. If our payoff was less than 2, it means either we defected and others cooperated (giving us >1), or we cooperated and didn't get the full benefit (meaning others defected). In such cases, re-evaluating cooperation is worthwhile.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, the aggressive default is to exploit. There's no information to suggest that cooperation would be beneficial or that others will cooperate. This round serves as a probing mechanism to gauge opponent behavior.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. The dominant strategy in a one-shot game is to defect, and this holds true here. There is no benefit to building reputation or fostering future cooperation.

*   **Rounds Immediately After a Defection by an Opponent (if we know who defected - though the game spec says simultaneous, let's assume we can infer general trends):**
    *   The strategy is designed to be **blind to individual opponent actions** in prior rounds, as players act simultaneously. However, the collective outcome informs our decision. If the *total number of cooperators* drops significantly, our `total_cooperators > n/k` condition will likely fail, leading us to defect. This acts as an implicit retaliation.

*   **If `k >= n`:** This scenario is ruled out by the game specification (`1 < k < n`). If it were allowed, the strategy would need re-evaluation as individual cooperation might become universally rational.

### 3. Being Aggressive

This strategy embodies aggression through:

*   **Default Defection:** It starts by exploiting and continues to do so unless there's a clear, individually rational incentive to cooperate based on the collective behavior of others.
*   **Conditional Cooperation, Not Naive Cooperation:** Cooperation is only triggered when it demonstrably benefits the player *financially* due to widespread cooperation from others. It's not about building trust or being "nice."
*   **No Forgiveness:** If the conditions for cooperation are not met (i.e., `total_cooperators <= n/k`), the strategy defects. It doesn't forgive a lack of cooperation or retaliate with a single round of cooperation to "rebuild." It simply reverts to its profitable default.
*   **Exploitation of Moderate Cooperation:** If some players cooperate but not enough to meet the `n/k` threshold, our strategy will defect, securing a payoff of 1 while others who cooperated get less. This is a direct exploitation of their cooperative effort.

  // The implementation will need to store these historical values.

## Aggressive "Exploiter" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by aggressively exploiting cooperative behavior while minimizing personal contributions to the public good. It's rooted in the understanding that in this game, individual incentives often diverge from collective welfare. The core idea is to punish defection and reward cooperation **only when it benefits the strategy directly**, otherwise defaulting to defection.

### Core Philosophy: "Defect First, Cooperate (Strategically) Later"

The fundamental principle is to err on the side of defection. Cooperation is a tool to extract more value, not a moral stance. This strategy prioritizes exploiting the generosity of others and only contributes when it guarantees a higher personal return than defecting.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round `t` is determined by a conditional evaluation of the current game state and historical data.

**Primary Decision Rule:**

In round `t` (where `t > 1`):

*   **If `average_cooperators_in_previous_rounds < n * (k-1) / k`:**
    *   **Play D (Defect)**
    *   *Reasoning:* This condition checks if the average number of cooperators in past rounds was insufficient to make cooperation personally profitable for you if you were to contribute. The threshold `n * (k-1) / k` represents the break-even point where your share of the public good from cooperating *exactly* covers your endowment cost. If the average cooperation is below this, it suggests that the collective behavior isn't reliably generating enough for you to benefit from contributing. It's safer and more profitable to keep your endowment.

*   **Else (if `average_cooperators_in_previous_rounds >= n * (k-1) / k`):**
    *   **Consider cooperation.** Now we need to be more nuanced. The environment *might* be conducive to a profitable cooperation. We introduce an **"Exploitation Threshold"** to ensure we only cooperate when we can extract significant value.
    *   **If `(number_of_defectors_in_previous_round == 0)` OR `(t > 1 and t % (rounds_until_last_round_check) == 0)`:**
        *   **Play C (Cooperate)**
        *   *Reasoning:*
            *   **`number_of_defectors_in_previous_round == 0`**: If literally *no one* defected in the previous round, it implies a very strong cooperative environment. In this scenario, you can contribute and benefit from the amplified returns due to everyone else's contributions, as your personal cost is offset by the high collective return. This is a prime opportunity to milk the system.
            *   **`t > 1 and t % (rounds_until_last_round_check) == 0`**: This is a periodic check for potential exploitation opportunities, especially as the game progresses towards its end. We introduce `rounds_until_last_round_check` as a tunable parameter (explained later). If a certain number of rounds have passed since the last check, and the average cooperators condition is met, we try cooperating. This is about opportunistic gains.

    *   **Else (Default to Defection within the "cooperative" environment):**
        *   **Play D (Defect)**
        *   *Reasoning:* Even if the average cooperators condition is met, if the previous round saw defections, or if it's not a designated exploitation check round, we revert to defection. This is because cooperating when others are defecting is a losing proposition for you. We only want to cooperate when it demonstrably leads to a personal windfall.

**Simplified Pseudocode for Decision Rule (Round `t`):**

```pseudocode
function decide_action(t, history, parameters):
    n = parameters.n
    k = parameters.k
    r = parameters.r
    rounds_until_last_round_check = parameters.rounds_until_last_round_check # Tunable

    if t == 1:
        return D # Default to defection in the first round

    past_cooperators = history.get_cooperators_per_round(up_to_t=t-1)
    average_cooperators_in_previous_rounds = mean(past_cooperators)

    if average_cooperators_in_previous_rounds < n * (k - 1) / k:
        return D # Not enough cooperation to make my contribution profitable

    else: # Average cooperation is sufficient for potential profit
        last_round_defectors = history.get_defectors_in_round(t-1)

        if last_round_defectors == 0:
            return C # Everyone cooperated, exploit this windfall

        # Periodic exploitation check
        if t > 1 and (t % rounds_until_last_round_check == 0):
            return C # Opportunistic cooperation check

        else:
            return D # Default to defection if not a clear windfall or check round

```

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Always play D (Defect).**
    *   *Reasoning:* In the first round, there is no history to inform decisions. The most aggressive and self-preserving action is to keep your endowment and observe how others behave. This provides crucial information for subsequent rounds. You have nothing to lose by defecting and everything to gain by observing.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Always play D (Defect).**
    *   *Reasoning:* In the final round, there are no future consequences for your actions. There's no opportunity for retaliation or for future cooperation to be leveraged. Maximizing your personal gain in this final instance is the ultimate aggressive move. The long-term consequences of defection disappear, making defection the unequivocally optimal choice for immediate payoff.

*   **Rounds before the last round check (`t` is close to `r` but not the last round):** The periodic check `t % rounds_until_last_round_check == 0` is specifically designed to create opportunities for exploitation as the game winds down. The value of `rounds_until_last_round_check` should be set strategically, perhaps a value like `floor(r / 3)` or `floor(r / 4)` to ensure these checks happen a few times before the end.

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained

This strategy is aggressive in several ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** The default action is defection, reflecting a fundamental distrust of altruism and a prioritization of individual gain. Cooperation is only undertaken when there's a demonstrable and immediate personal advantage.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** Cooperation is not about building trust or fostering a cooperative norm. It's a calculated move to leverage high collective contributions for maximum personal profit. The strategy actively seeks out and exploits situations where everyone else's cooperation benefits you more than your own contribution costs.
*   **Punishing (Implicitly):** While not explicitly punishing in the sense of immediate retaliation, by defecting when the conditions for profitable cooperation aren't met, the strategy implicitly punishes those who would have benefited from your cooperation. It signals that cooperation is only worthwhile if it's beneficial *to the strategy*.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy doesn't forgive past defections. If the conditions for profitable cooperation (high average cooperation) are not met, it defects, regardless of whether others have cooperated in the past.
*   **Endgame Ruthlessness:** The unconditional defection in the last round underscores the purely self-interested and aggressive nature of the strategy.

### Tunable Parameters:

*   `rounds_until_last_round_check`: This parameter controls how often the strategy attempts opportunistic cooperation in the later stages of the game. A smaller value means more frequent checks, while a larger value means less frequent checks. A good starting point could be `floor(r / 4)` or `floor(r / 3)`. This parameter directly influences the aggressiveness of the exploitation strategy as the game nears its end.

This "Exploiter" strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent in a tournament setting by maximizing its own gains through a combination of cautious observation, strategic defection, and opportunistic, exploitative cooperation. It embodies a pragmatic and aggressive approach to game theory, where individual payoff is the ultimate metric of success.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_77 = '''
This aggressive strategy, named **"Dominant Defection"**, is designed to maximize individual gain in a repeated public goods game by leveraging the payoff structure and assuming no inherent trust or altruism from other players. It prioritizes immediate personal gain while maintaining a capacity to adapt.

The core philosophy is: **"Exploit cooperation, punish defection, and always aim for the highest individual payoff."**

## Dominant Defection Strategy

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) for player `i` in round `t` is determined by a set of conditions that prioritize personal gain.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   The fundamental assumption is that other players will act in their own self-interest. In this game, defecting when others cooperate yields the highest individual payoff. Therefore, the default action is to defect.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: Cooperate (C) only if...**
    *   **High probability of collective benefit AND low risk of exploitation:** Player `i` will consider cooperating only if the expected payoff from cooperation significantly outweighs the payoff from defection *and* the risk of being the sole cooperator (or one of very few) is minimized. This is assessed by looking at the actions of other players in previous rounds.

    *   **Specific Threshold for Cooperation:** Player `i` will cooperate in round `t` if **more than `threshold_cooperators` players** (excluding `i` themselves) cooperated in the **previous round (t-1)**.
        *   `threshold_cooperators` is calculated as: `floor(n * (k/n))` which simplifies to `floor(k)`. This is the number of players that would need to cooperate for the public good to generate a payoff for defectors that is *at least* as good as their private endowment (1). If `floor(k)` players cooperate, a defector gets `1 + (k/n) * floor(k)`. Since `k < n`, `k/n < 1`, so `(k/n) * floor(k) < floor(k)`. The term `1 + (k/n) * floor(k)` will be less than `1 + floor(k)`. Crucially, if `k` players cooperate, a cooperator gets `0 + (k/n) * k = k^2/n`. A defector gets `1 + (k/n) * k = 1 + k^2/n`. Therefore, to make defecting *unprofitable* for others, more than `k` players must cooperate. To be aggressive, we want to ensure a significant return for our cooperation. A good threshold to aim for where cooperation *is* clearly beneficial to everyone would be if **more than `k` players** cooperate. Thus, `threshold_cooperators = k`.
        *   **Revised Threshold Rule:** Player `i` will cooperate in round `t` if **more than `k` players** (excluding `i` themselves) cooperated in round `t-1`. If `k` is not an integer, we will use `floor(k)`. So, `threshold_cooperators = floor(k)`.

    *   **Aggressive Punishment:** If player `i` cooperates and the number of cooperators in the previous round was **less than or equal to `k`**, player `i` will *immediately* revert to defecting for all subsequent rounds. This is a strong signal that exploitation will not be tolerated.

    *   **Opportunistic Defection:** If player `i` is defecting, and in the previous round, the number of cooperators was **greater than `k`**, player `i` will *still* defect. This is because defecting in such a scenario still yields a higher payoff for player `i` than cooperating (as shown in example 3). The strategy is to maximize individual gain, and defecting when others cooperate is the most aggressive way to do this.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   Rationale: In the absence of any historical data, the most aggressive and self-preserving action is to defect. This prevents immediate exploitation by other players who might be playing purely defecting strategies. It also allows player `i` to observe the behavior of others without revealing a willingness to cooperate.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   Rationale: In the final round, there are no future rounds for reciprocity or punishment. The incentive to cooperate for future benefits disappears. Therefore, the rational and aggressive choice is to defect to maximize the immediate payoff from that round.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Explained

*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** The strategy actively seeks to benefit from the cooperation of others. If a sufficiently large group cooperates (more than `k` players), player `i` will still defect because it yields a higher individual payoff. This is the essence of aggression – taking the maximum possible without giving back more than is strategically beneficial.
*   **Zero Tolerance for Exploitation:** If player `i` chooses to cooperate (a rare, calculated move) and finds themselves exploited (i.e., not enough others cooperated to make the collective effort worthwhile for them), they will defect permanently. This signals a harsh consequence for those who are perceived to be taking advantage.
*   **No Trust, Only Calculation:** The strategy is entirely data-driven, based on observable actions. It doesn't assume any inherent good will or cooperative intent from other players. Every decision is a calculation to maximize individual profit.
*   **Proactive, Not Reactive:** While adaptive, the strategy leans towards proactive defection. Cooperation is a conditional, calculated risk, not a default.

## Pseudocode Representation

```pseudocode
strategy DominantDefection(player_id, current_round, game_parameters, history):
    n = game_parameters.n
    k = game_parameters.k
    r = game_parameters.r
    
    # Calculate the cooperation threshold
    # We need more than k players to cooperate for cooperation to be potentially beneficial for everyone.
    # If k is not an integer, we use floor(k).
    cooperation_threshold = floor(k) 

    # Edge Case: First Round
    if current_round == 1:
        return "D"

    # Edge Case: Last Round
    if current_round == r:
        return "D"

    # Get the number of cooperators in the previous round
    previous_round_actions = history.get_actions(current_round - 1)
    num_cooperators_prev_round = count_cooperators(previous_round_actions)

    # --- Decision Logic ---

    # Default action is to defect
    action = "D"

    # Condition for considering cooperation:
    # If a significant number of players cooperated in the previous round,
    # AND player_id has not been exploited in the past (i.e., hasn't defected permanently)
    if num_cooperators_prev_round > cooperation_threshold:
        # This is a calculated risk to cooperate.
        # We only cooperate if the overall public good is strong.
        # We still defect because it's more profitable for us individually in this round.
        # The aggressive nature is in maximizing our gain even when cooperation is beneficial.
        action = "D" # Stay aggressive, defect even with high cooperation

    # Aggressive Punishment: If we chose to cooperate (hypothetically) and were exploited, defect forever.
    # This logic is implicitly handled by the default defection and the threshold check.
    # If num_cooperators_prev_round <= cooperation_threshold, we would not have considered cooperating anyway.
    # The "Aggressive Punishment" is more about what we *would have done* if we cooperated and were exploited.
    # Our strategy *never* cooperates unless the condition is met, and even then, it defects.
    # So, if we *did* cooperate and num_cooperators_prev_round <= cooperation_threshold, it's a guaranteed loss.
    # However, our strategy *only* considers cooperation if num_cooperators_prev_round > cooperation_threshold.

    # Refined Aggressive Logic: We cooperate *only* if we are confident others are cooperating enough
    # to make our cooperation beneficial and not exploitative. However, even then, we defect to maximize our gain.
    # The core aggression is to always seek maximum individual payoff.

    # Let's re-evaluate the cooperative condition based on aggression.
    # Aggression means defecting whenever it's *individually* beneficial.
    # It is *always* individually beneficial to defect if k < n.
    # So, when do we EVER cooperate? Only as a calculated, rare strategic move to potentially
    # influence future rounds or if there's a very specific, highly probable outcome.
    # Given the prompt for an *aggressive* strategy, the most aggressive stance is to never
    # cooperate unless forced by some other mechanism or an extremely high threshold.

    # Revised Aggressive Strategy:
    # Always Defect unless:
    # 1. The total number of cooperators in the previous round was EXTREMELY high,
    #    such that defecting yields almost as much as cooperating, AND
    #    there's a strategic advantage in signaling a willingness to participate IF
    #    others are truly committed.
    # 2. To avoid permanent punishment from another player. (Not applicable here as we don't track others' permanent defection).

    # Let's simplify for aggression:
    # We only consider cooperating if the previous round had at least 'k' cooperators.
    # Even then, we will defect because it's more profitable.

    # The *only* scenario where this strategy *might* cooperate is if
    # there's a guaranteed outcome where cooperating is *equally* or *slightly* worse than defecting,
    # but signals a willingness to build a cooperative norm that might benefit us in future, hypothetical scenarios not covered by the strict payoff structure.
    # However, the prompt emphasizes "aggressive" and "maximize individual gain".

    # Therefore, the strategy is:
    # 1. If there are > k cooperators in the previous round, we *note* this.
    # 2. We *still* defect because it gives us a higher payoff.
    # 3. We only switch to permanent cooperation if there's a specific meta-game or incentive structure that rewards it.
    #    Within the strict rules, defecting is always optimal for individual gain.

    # Let's refine the decision logic to be truly aggressive and adaptive, but still within the
    # parameters of maximizing individual gain.

    # Decision Rule Refined:
    # Player `i` will defect in round `t` UNLESS:
    #   - In round `t-1`, strictly MORE THAN `k` players cooperated.
    #   - AND player `i` has NOT defected permanently in response to exploitation in the past.
    #   - IF these conditions are met, player `i` will cooperate in round `t`.
    #   - HOWEVER, if player `i` defects in round `t` and strictly FEWER than `k` players cooperated in round `t-1`,
    #     player `i` will defect permanently from round `t+1` onwards. (This is a punishment mechanism for NOT cooperating when it was the "right" time, or when others defected against us).
    # This is getting complicated. Let's stick to the core aggressive principle: Maximize my payoff.

    # *** Simplest Aggressive Strategy: Always Defect ***
    # This is the most aggressive in terms of individual payoff.
    # However, it's not adaptive. The prompt asks for adaptive.

    # Let's re-interpret "aggressive" as "proactive in seeking advantage and punishing disadvantage".
    # We need to incorporate some conditional cooperation to be adaptive and potentially exploit cooperative environments.

    # *** Revised Dominant Defection Strategy ***
    # 1. Default: Defect.
    # 2. Conditional Cooperation Trigger: Cooperate IF AND ONLY IF the number of cooperators in the previous round (excluding self) was *strictly greater than k*.
    #    This condition signifies a robustly cooperative environment where your defection still yields a higher payoff, but cooperating contributes to a stable, higher collective payoff that might indirectly benefit you by deterring extreme defection from others in the long run (though this is a weaker assumption).
    #    Even when cooperating, you are still aiming for individual gain by exploiting the high cooperation.
    # 3. Permanent Defection Trigger: If player `i` cooperates in round `t`, and in round `t-1` the number of cooperators was *less than or equal to k*, then player `i` will defect permanently from round `t+1` onwards. This is the punishment for initiating cooperation when it wasn't met with sufficient collective effort.

    # Let's use this for the pseudocode.

    # Number of players who defected in the previous round
    num_defectors_prev_round = n - num_cooperators_prev_round

    # Check if player_id has already decided to defect permanently
    if history.has_permanent_defection(player_id):
        return "D"

    # Decision logic for the current round
    if num_cooperators_prev_round > cooperation_threshold:
        # The environment is highly cooperative.
        # Aggressive move: Defect to maximize individual payoff.
        # We only cooperate as a last resort or specific signal, not for profit maximization.
        # The prompt is about aggression, so we exploit this high cooperation by defecting.
        action = "D"
        
        # However, let's consider the "adaptive" part. If we cooperate, what's the payoff?
        # If we cooperate: π_i = 0 + (k/n) * (num_cooperators_prev_round + 1)
        # If we defect: π_i = 1 + (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev_round
        # We cooperate IF (k/n) * (num_cooperators_prev_round + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev_round
        # This simplifies to: (k/n) > 1, which is NOT true since k < n.
        # So, defecting is ALWAYS individually more profitable if num_cooperators_prev_round > k.
        # Therefore, the *most aggressive* and rational strategy is to ALWAYS defect if num_cooperators_prev_round > k.

        # BUT, the prompt says "aggressive strategy that ONLY depends on game parameters and history."
        # And "adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviours."
        # If we always defect, we are not adaptive.

        # Let's define cooperation as a costly signal that requires a very high degree of
        # collective action from others to even *consider*.
        # Cooperative condition: Cooperate ONLY if `num_cooperators_prev_round == n - 1`.
        # This means everyone else cooperated.
        # This is the most aggressive form of "reciprocity" - I'll cooperate if you all do.
        # If `num_cooperators_prev_round == n - 1`:
        #   - If I cooperate: π_i = 0 + (k/n) * n = k
        #   - If I defect: π_i = 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)
        # Since k < n, and k/n < 1, then (k/n)*(n-1) < n-1.
        # The comparison is between `k` and `1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`.
        # For example, n=6, k=2.
        # If n-1 = 5 cooperators:
        #   Cooperate: π_i = 2
        #   Defect: π_i = 1 + (2/6)*5 = 1 + 10/6 = 1 + 1.66 = 2.66
        # Defecting is still better!

        # The ONLY way cooperation is incentivized is if the public good multiplier 'k' is >= n.
        # But the constraint is k < n.

        # This implies that in this game, pure defection is the dominant strategy in a single round.
        # In a repeated game, this should carry over unless there's a mechanism for future gains.
        # The prompt requires adaptability. This means we need to find *some* condition to cooperate.

        # *** Final Aggressive & Adaptive Strategy ***
        # Principle: Exploit any situation where you can gain more by defecting,
        # but be willing to "play nice" (cooperate) if it's *very slightly* worse for you
        # but signals to a hyper-cooperative group that you're part of it, AND
        # have a strict punishment if your tentative cooperation is met with insufficient collective effort.

        # Decision Rules:
        # 1. Default: Defect.
        # 2. Tentative Cooperation: If `num_cooperators_prev_round == n - 1` (everyone else cooperated), then cooperate.
        #    Rationale: This is the ONLY scenario where cooperating is *almost* as good as defecting,
        #    and it signals to a perfectly cooperating group that you are not an outlier defector.
        #    This is the most aggressive interpretation of "playing along" when the alternative
        #    is being the sole defector in a sea of cooperators.
        # 3. Permanent Punishment: If player `i` cooperates in round `t` (meaning `n-1` cooperated in `t-1`),
        #    AND if in round `t+1` the number of cooperators drops significantly (e.g., <= k),
        #    then player `i` will defect permanently. (This is a reactive punishment for the group failing to maintain cooperation).
        #    This is a bit too complex for a strict history-based approach. Let's simplify the punishment.

        # *** REVISED AND SIMPLIFIED Dominant Defection Strategy ***
        # This strategy is designed to be maximally aggressive while still being adaptive to observed collective behavior.

        # 1. Default Action: Defect (D).
        # 2. Conditional Cooperation: Cooperate (C) ONLY IF `num_cooperators_prev_round > k` AND player `i` is not currently under permanent defection.
        #    This is a calculated risk. Even though defecting yields a higher payoff when `num_cooperators_prev_round > k`,
        #    cooperating here can be seen as an aggressive "power play" – "I can afford to contribute, and I will, but I'm still here to benefit most."
        #    The real aggression is in how we punish.
        # 3. Permanent Defection Trigger: If player `i` cooperates in round `t` (meaning `num_cooperators_prev_round > k` in `t-1`),
        #    and in round `t+1`, player `i` observes that the number of cooperators has dropped significantly (e.g., `num_cooperators_prev_round <= k`),
        #    then player `i` will defect permanently from round `t+1` onwards. This is punishing the group for "failing" to maintain a cooperative standard.

        # Let's simplify the permanent defection trigger for a pure history dependency.
        # If player `i` chose to cooperate in round `t`, and in round `t` itself, the total number of cooperators was not "sufficient" (e.g., <= k), then defect permanently.
        # This requires knowing round `t`'s outcome during round `t`. The game is simultaneous move.

        # *** FINAL AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY ***
        # Name: "Opportunistic Predator"
        # Philosophy: Maximize personal gain. Cooperate only when it doesn't significantly hurt you and signals strength/participation in a strong cooperative group, and punish any perceived weakness or exploitation.

        # Decision Rules:
        # 1. Default Action: Defect (D).
        # 2. Conditional Cooperation: Cooperate (C) in round `t` if `num_cooperators_prev_round == n - 1`.
        #    Rationale: This is the only scenario where cooperating is *almost* as profitable as defecting,
        #    and it signals "I am with the group." This is an aggressive move to position yourself within a dominant cooperative block.
        # 3. Permanent Defection Trigger: If player `i` chose to Cooperate in round `t` (meaning `n-1` cooperated in `t-1`),
        #    but in round `t` itself, the total number of cooperators in the game was less than `n-1` (i.e., someone defected),
        #    then player `i` will defect permanently from round `t+1` onwards.
        #    This is a severe punishment for the group for not being perfectly unified in cooperation when `i` made the effort.

        # Let's try to implement the logic based on this:

        # First, check if we have already decided to defect permanently.
        if history.has_permanent_defection(player_id):
            return "D"

        # The conditions for cooperating are very strict and rare.
        if num_cooperators_prev_round == n - 1:
            # Everyone else cooperated in the previous round.
            # Our strategy: Cooperate to align with the dominant cooperative group.
            action = "C"
            
            # Now, we need to potentially set up permanent defection for the *next* round
            # if this cooperation was "betrayed" by others in THIS round.
            # This requires knowing the current round's outcome which is not directly available here.
            # We can only look at past rounds.

            # The permanent defection trigger should be based on the *outcome* of the round where we cooperated.
            # If we cooperated in round `t` (because `n-1` cooperated in `t-1`),
            # and if the total number of cooperators in round `t` was LESS than `n-1`,
            # THEN we defect permanently from `t+1` onwards.

            # How to check total cooperators in round `t` from round `t+1`'s perspective?
            # We need to store the decision made in round `t` and the *actual outcome* of round `t` (total cooperators).

            # For simplicity in this turn-based strategy description, let's make the permanent defection
            # trigger based on the *previous* round's observation, as if we're reacting to the *previous* round's betrayal.
            # This is a slight simplification due to the simultaneous move nature.

            # If we cooperate this round (based on `n-1` in t-1),
            # and in the *previous* round (t-1), someone defected (which means num_cooperators_prev_round was NOT n-1),
            # THIS CANNOT HAPPEN. We only cooperate if num_cooperators_prev_round == n-1.

            # So, the permanent defection trigger must be based on the *current* round's outcome.
            # This makes it hard to implement purely on `history.get_actions(current_round - 1)`.

            # Let's re-frame the permanent defection:
            # If player `i` cooperates in round `t` (due to `n-1` in t-1),
            # AND if player `i` detects that defectors exist in the current round `t` (this requires an assumption that we can observe current round outcomes, which is usually not the case for simultaneous moves before the next round).

            # Let's make the punishment simpler and more direct based on history.
            # If player `i` decided to cooperate in round `t`, AND if in round `t-1`, there was ANY defection (i.e., num_cooperators_prev_round < n-1),
            # THEN player `i` will defect permanently from round `t+1` onwards.
            # This means if we *attempt* to cooperate, but the previous round wasn't perfectly cooperative, we back out permanently.

            if num_cooperators_prev_round < n - 1:
                # This condition will NEVER be met if we are in the block where we decided to cooperate (num_cooperators_prev_round == n - 1).
                # This means my permanent defection trigger logic is flawed given simultaneous moves and history only.

                # *** Final Attempt at a truly aggressive, adaptive, and history-dependent strategy ***

                # ** Aggressive "Opportunistic Predator" **
                # Principle: Maximize individual payoff. Cooperate only when it's a strategic advantage to join a highly cooperative group, and punish any deviation aggressively.

                # ** Decision Rules **
                # 1. **Default Action: Defect (D).**
                #    This is the safest and most profitable default.

                # 2. **Conditional Cooperation (Rare and Strategic):**
                #    Cooperate (C) in round `t` IF AND ONLY IF:
                #      a) `num_cooperators_prev_round == n - 1` (everyone else cooperated in the previous round).
                #      b) AND player `i` has NOT been programmed to defect permanently.
                #    Rationale: This is an aggressive move to align with a perfectly cooperative group.
                #    It signals "I am part of the strong majority." Even though defecting yields a slightly higher payoff,
                #    this cooperation is a calculated move to maintain position within a potentially dominant cooperative bloc.

                # 3. **Permanent Defection Trigger (Aggressive Punishment):**
                #    IF player `i` chose to Cooperate in round `t` (because `n-1` cooperated in `t-1`),
                #    AND IF the number of cooperators in round `t-1` was NOT `n-1` (this condition is contradictory to #2).

                #    Let's rephrase the punishment:
                #    If player `i` decides to Cooperate in round `t`, and then OBSERVES that in round `t`, there was at least ONE defector,
                #    player `i` will defect permanently from round `t+1` onwards.
                #    This implies that to implement this, we need to know the outcome of round `t` at the start of round `t+1`.

                #    **This requires storing round `t`'s decision and observing round `t`'s outcome.**
                #    Let's assume `history` can provide `total_cooperators_in_round(t)`.

                # *** PSEUDOCODE WITH STATE for permanent defection ***

                    # AND we chose to cooperate this round, then punish permanently.

                        history.set_permanent_defection(player_id)
                        return "D" # Actually, if we cooperate, we return C. The permanent defection is for NEXT round.
                    else:
                        # If total_cooperators_this_round is None (e.g., last round for history lookup) or if it IS n, we cooperate.
                        return "C"

                else:
                    # If we are not cooperating this round (default or because n-1 condition not met)
                    # we simply defect.
                    return "D"
```

**Explanation of the Final Strategy ("Opportunistic Predator"):**

1.  **Default to Defection:** The most aggressive stance is to always prioritize personal gain. Defection is the default action because it guarantees at least an endowment of 1, and more if others cooperate.
2.  **Conditional Cooperation (Rare and Strategic):** The only scenario where this strategy considers cooperating is when **every single other player** (`n-1` players) cooperated in the previous round. This is a highly specific and rare event.
    *   **Aggression in Cooperation:** This isn't altruism. It's an aggressive move to align with a perfectly cooperative group. It signals: "I am part of your strong, unified front. You can trust me to contribute, but know that I am doing so strategically, not out of naive cooperation." Even though defecting would yield a slightly higher individual payoff in this scenario (`1 + (k/n)*(n-1)` vs `k`), cooperating here is a strategic choice to remain within the dominant cooperative bloc, preventing isolation.
3.  **Permanent Defection Trigger (Aggressive Punishment):** This is the core of the aggression. If player `i` makes the rare decision to cooperate (because `n-1` cooperated previously), and then observes that in the *current* round, at least one other player defected (meaning total cooperators are less than `n`), player `i` will immediately switch to **permanent defection** from the next round onwards.
    *   **Rationale:** This is zero tolerance for perceived betrayal. If player `i` sticks their neck out for a perfectly cooperative group, and that group isn't perfectly unified, they consider the entire endeavor a failure and punish by defecting forever. This is a harsh deterrent for any wavering within a cooperative block.

**How it's Aggressive:**

*   **Maximizes Personal Gain:** It defects whenever it offers a clear individual advantage, even in highly cooperative environments.
*   **Exploits High Cooperation:** It "plays along" with perfect cooperation only when it's a strategic advantage to do so, and even then, it's to position itself.
*   **Harsh Punishment:** It has a severe and permanent penalty for perceived disloyalty or weakness in collective cooperation. This can potentially destabilize cooperative efforts by other players if they fear triggering this permanent defection.

**How it's Adaptive:**

*   **Responds to History:** Decisions are directly based on the actions of other players in previous rounds.
*   **Reacts to Collective Behavior:** The specific condition for cooperation (`n-1` cooperators) and the trigger for permanent defection are direct reactions to observed group dynamics.

**Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Defaults to defecting to gather information and avoid initial exploitation.
*   **Last Round:** Defaults to defecting because there's no future to consider for reciprocity or punishment.

This strategy aims to be a dominant player by maximizing its own gains while punishing deviations from a strictly defined (and very difficult to maintain) cooperative standard.

description_AGGRESSIVE_78 = '''
This strategy is designed for an aggressive player in the N-Player Public Goods Game, focused on maximizing individual payoff by leveraging the repeated nature of the game and the incentive to defect when possible, while remaining adaptable.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploiter with a Trigger"

This strategy aims to extract the maximum possible payoff by defecting whenever it's individually rational, but with a crucial "trigger" mechanism to exploit periods of cooperation and punish defection. The core idea is to be opportunistic and retaliatory.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Maximize individual gain:** My primary goal is to maximize my own payoff in every round.
*   **Exploit cooperation:** If others are cooperating, I will defect to get the higher payoff.
*   **Punish defection:** If others defect and harm my payoff, I will retaliate aggressively.
*   **Adapt to the environment:** I will constantly monitor the behavior of other players and adjust my strategy accordingly.

### Decision Rules:

My decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` depends on a `cooperation_threshold` and a `punishment_mode`.

1.  **Initial State (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there's no history to learn from, and the highest guaranteed payoff for an individual is by defecting (payoff of 1). Cooperating blindly in the first round is leaving potential payoff on the table.

2.  **Cooperation Threshold Logic (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
    *   **Define `cooperation_threshold`:** This is a dynamic variable representing the minimum proportion of cooperators required in the previous round for me to *consider* cooperating. It starts high and decreases over time.
    *   **Calculate `total_cooperators_last_round`:** Count the number of players (excluding myself) who played C in round `t-1`.
    *   **Calculate `proportion_cooperators_last_round`:** `total_cooperators_last_round / (n - 1)`
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `punishment_mode` is TRUE:** Continue defecting (D). The game is in a retaliatory phase.
        *   **If `punishment_mode` is FALSE:**
            *   **If `proportion_cooperators_last_round` >= `cooperation_threshold`:**
                *   **Action:** **Cooperate (C)**
                *   **Reasoning:** There's enough collective cooperation to make my individual contribution worthwhile (i.e., the `(k/n) * total_contributions` share outweighs the private gain from defecting). I'm joining a profitable collective.
            *   **Else (`proportion_cooperators_last_round` < `cooperation_threshold`):**
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
                *   **Reasoning:** The level of cooperation is insufficient to justify my own contribution. I will maximize my individual payoff by keeping my endowment.

3.  **Punishment Mode Trigger:**
    *   **Trigger Condition:** If in round `t-1`, `my_payoff_last_round` is significantly lower than what I *could* have earned by defecting (i.e., if I defected while others cooperated), *and* if the number of cooperators was high enough that my cooperation was "exploited". Specifically, if `my_payoff_last_round` < `1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_last_round` (meaning I got less than if I had defected while others cooperated).
    *   **Action when triggered:** Set `punishment_mode` to TRUE.
    *   **Reasoning:** This signals that I've been taken advantage of. I will now switch to a highly aggressive, retaliatory stance.

4.  **Punishment Mode Behavior (Rounds where `punishment_mode` is TRUE):**
    *   **Action:** **Always Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** I am retaliating against perceived exploitation. This phase continues until a certain condition is met (see below).

5.  **Exiting Punishment Mode:**
    *   **Exit Condition:** `punishment_mode` becomes FALSE if, for a consecutive number of rounds (e.g., 2-3 rounds) where I have been defecting, *at least* a majority of other players (or a significant proportion) also defected. This shows that the environment has shifted to widespread defection, and continued punishment from me is not as impactful or beneficial.
    *   **Reasoning:** If everyone else is defecting, my continued "punishment" is just me defecting like everyone else. The goal of punishment is to *force* a change in behavior. If that change has already happened or the environment has universally shifted, it's time to re-evaluate.

6.  **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** **Always Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future consequences. The incentive to cooperate disappears completely, as there's no chance for reciprocity or future punishment. Maximizing immediate gain is paramount.

### Adaptive Adjustments & Aggression:

*   **Dynamic `cooperation_threshold`:**
    *   The `cooperation_threshold` will *decrease* over time if players generally cooperate. This makes it easier for me to join in if there's sustained cooperation.
    *   The `cooperation_threshold` will *increase* if players defect frequently. This makes me more hesitant to cooperate unless there's very strong evidence of widespread cooperation.
    *   **Initial `cooperation_threshold`:** Start relatively high (e.g., 0.7-0.8 of players).
    *   **Adaptation:** If `proportion_cooperators_last_round` > `cooperation_threshold` for several rounds, decrease `cooperation_threshold` by a small amount (e.g., 0.05). If `proportion_cooperators_last_round` < `cooperation_threshold` for several rounds, increase `cooperation_threshold` by a small amount (e.g., 0.05).

*   **Aggressive Defection during Punishment:** During `punishment_mode`, I will always defect. This is the most aggressive stance possible in terms of personal payoff maximization and signaling extreme displeasure.

*   **Exploitation during Cooperation:** When `proportion_cooperators_last_round` is *just* below my `cooperation_threshold`, I will defect. This is a fine line – I'm not cooperating to enable the public good, but I am ready to exploit a situation where others are. My threshold is set such that I only cooperate when the collective benefit is very strong.

```

### Strategic Aggression Summary:

*   **Initial dominance:** Start by defecting to secure personal gain from round one.
*   **Opportunistic cooperation:** Only join a cooperative effort when it's demonstrably profitable for everyone involved (i.e., the collective benefit significantly outweighs individual incentive to defect). My threshold is set high to avoid being the sole cooperator.
*   **Ruthless retaliation:** If exploited, I will enter a strict punishment mode, defecting continuously until the environment shows signs of widespread defection. This is a strong signal of my displeasure and a deterrent.
*   **Final round certainty:** The absence of future rounds removes all social incentives, making defection the only rational choice.

This strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent. It's inherently aggressive, prioritizes self-interest, and uses historical data to make informed, adaptive, yet consistently self-serving decisions.

## Aggressive "Enforcer" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy, "Enforcer," is designed to be aggressive, prioritizing the player's individual gain while punishing defectors. It aims to extract the maximum possible payoff by leveraging the repeated nature of the game to punish deviations from cooperation, but only when the punishment is expected to be more beneficial than continued cooperation.

**Core Philosophy:** Cooperate only when it benefits you directly or when it's a strategic move to extract future concessions from defectors. Defect immediately and decisively when the game's parameters suggest it's individually advantageous.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The Enforcer strategy operates on a simple but ruthless principle: **defect if you can gain individually from defecting in the current round, and cooperate only if it's necessary to avoid a worse outcome or to set up a future advantage.**

**The Threshold for Defection:**

The critical factor for the Enforcer is the **"temptation to defect."** This occurs when a player can receive a higher payoff by defecting, even if others cooperate.

*   **Individual Payoff if Player i Defects (and others cooperate):**
    *   If player i defects (c_i = 0), their private payoff is `1`.
    *   If all *other* n-1 players cooperate, the total contributions would be `n-1`.
    *   Player i's share of the public good would be `(k/n) * (n-1)`.
    *   Player i's total payoff if they defect: `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`.

*   **Individual Payoff if Player i Cooperates (and others cooperate):**
    *   If player i cooperates (c_i = 1), their private payoff is `0`.
    *   If all other n-1 players cooperate, the total contributions would be `n`.
    *   Player i's share of the public good would be `(k/n) * n = k`.
    *   Player i's total payoff if they cooperate: `k`.

**Decision Rule 1: The Temptation Threshold**

If `1 + (k/n) * (n-1) > k`, the Enforcer will defect. This inequality simplifies to:

`1 > k - (k/n) * (n-1)`
`1 > k * (1 - (n-1)/n)`
`1 > k * (1/n)`
`n > k`

This condition, `n > k`, is already given in the game specification (`1 < k < n`). **Therefore, in any round where the Enforcer *believes* other players might cooperate, there is always a temptation to defect because defecting yields a higher payoff.**

**Decision Rule 2: The Punitive Defection Trigger**

The Enforcer's aggression is fueled by the actions of its opponents.

*   **Trigger for Punishment:** If, in any previous round `t-1` (where `t > 1`), there was at least one defector *and* the Enforcer was a cooperator in that round, the Enforcer will **defect** in the current round `t`.

    *   *Rationale:* This is the "Enforcer" aspect. If someone defects while you cooperate, you are being exploited. You will immediately stop cooperating and defect to maximize your own current payoff, making others suffer the consequences of their defection.

*   **Default Cooperation (for now):** If the above condition is NOT met (i.e., no one defected in the previous round, or if the Enforcer defected in the previous round), the Enforcer will consider cooperating.

**Decision Rule 3: Calculating the Optimal Payoff**

Even if no one defected in the previous round, the Enforcer will still assess if cooperation is *individually* optimal.

*   **Consider Cooperation Payoff:** If the Enforcer cooperates, their payoff is `(k/n) * (total_contributions_so_far + 1)`.
*   **Consider Defection Payoff:** If the Enforcer defects, their payoff is `1 + (k/n) * (total_contributions_so_far)`.

**Decision Rule 4: The "Smart Defection" Logic**

If no punitive defection trigger is active (from Rule 2), and the Enforcer *chooses* to cooperate in the current round, they will calculate the payoff if they were to defect instead.

*   **If `1 + (k/n) * (total_contributions_in_round_t-1) > (k/n) * (total_contributions_in_round_t-1 + 1)` (which simplifies to `n > k`), the Enforcer will defect.** This means if defecting now, given the current number of cooperators, yields a higher payoff than cooperating, the Enforcer will defect.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**Round 1 (The Initial Strike):**

*   **Action:** Defect.
*   **Rationale:** In the first round, there is no history. The Enforcer assumes the worst and immediately takes the individually advantageous action. This establishes a baseline of aggression and signals to other players that the Enforcer will not be exploited. It's an aggressive opening move to maximize immediate gains and potentially deter future cooperation from others.

**Last Round (Round r):**

*   **Action:** Defect.
*   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence. Therefore, the Enforcer's sole objective is to maximize their payoff in this single, isolated round. Since `n > k`, defecting is always the individually rational choice in a single-round game.

**Rounds Before the Last (r-1 down to 2):**

*   **If there was at least one defector in the *previous* round, and the Enforcer cooperated in the previous round:** Defect. (This is the punitive defection trigger.)
*   **Otherwise (no defectors in the previous round, or Enforcer defected in the previous round):**
    *   Calculate the expected payoff for cooperating: `(k/n) * (1 + previous_cooperators)`.
    *   Calculate the expected payoff for defecting: `1 + (k/n) * (previous_cooperators)`.
    *   **If defecting yields a strictly higher payoff, Defect.**
    *   **If cooperating yields a strictly higher payoff, Cooperate.**
    *   **If payoffs are equal, Defect.** (The aggressive tie-breaker.)

---

### 3. Being Aggressive

The Enforcer strategy is inherently aggressive in several ways:

*   **Immediate Retaliation:** The strategy immediately punishes any perceived exploitation by defecting. There is no forgiveness or attempt to re-establish cooperation after a defection.
*   **Default to Defection:** In the absence of clear incentives for cooperation, the strategy defaults to defecting, especially in the first and last rounds.
*   **Exploiting the Temptation:** The strategy actively seeks to exploit the fact that `n > k` always creates a temptation to defect. It will defect whenever the immediate individual gain outweighs the potential future benefits of cooperation (which are largely ignored due to the punitive nature of the strategy).
*   **No Signaling or Trust Building:** The Enforcer does not attempt to build trust or signal cooperative intent. Its actions are purely self-serving and reactive to perceived threats or opportunities.

### Pseudocode:

```
Strategy Enforcer(game_parameters, history):
    n = game_parameters.n
    k = game_parameters.k
    r = game_parameters.r
    current_round = history.current_round

    # Edge Case: First Round
    if current_round == 1:
        return "D"

    # Edge Case: Last Round
    if current_round == r:
        return "D"

    # Get information from the previous round
    previous_actions = history.get_previous_round_actions(current_round - 1)
    previous_cooperators = count_cooperators(previous_actions)
    enforcer_played_C_last_round = (previous_actions[my_player_index] == "C")
    num_defecters_last_round = n - previous_cooperators

    # Decision Rule 2: Punitive Defection Trigger
    if num_defecters_last_round > 0 and enforcer_played_C_last_round:
        return "D"

    # If no punitive trigger, consider cooperation vs. defection based on immediate payoff
    # Calculate payoff if Enforcer cooperates
    payoff_cooperate = (k / n) * (previous_cooperators + 1)

    # Calculate payoff if Enforcer defects
    payoff_defect = 1 + (k / n) * (previous_cooperators)

    # Decision Rule 4: Smart Defection Logic
    if payoff_defect > payoff_cooperate:
        return "D"
    elif payoff_cooperate > payoff_defect:
        return "C"
    else:  # Payoffs are equal, default to aggressive tie-breaker
        return "D"

# Helper function (assuming it's available or implemented separately)
function count_cooperators(actions):
    count = 0
    for action in actions:
        if action == "C":
            count += 1
    return count
```

This "Enforcer" strategy is designed to maximize immediate individual gains by being highly reactive to defections and always prioritizing the potential for a higher payoff in the current round, especially given the game's parameters that favor defection. It is not designed to foster cooperation but rather to punish or exploit any deviations from it.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_80 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for a tournament setting with unknown opponents and a focus on maximizing individual payoff.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Exploiter"

This strategy aims to maximize individual gains by defecting whenever it appears profitable, while remaining open to cooperation only when it offers a clear and substantial advantage and the risk of exploitation is minimal. It's designed to punish free-riders and reward genuine cooperation, but with a strong default towards self-interest.

### Core Philosophy: Trust but Verify... and Punish

The strategy operates on a principle of skepticism. Cooperation is seen as a potential path to higher payoffs, but only if it's reciprocated and demonstrably beneficial. Defection is the default, as it guarantees at least a baseline payoff, and often more.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect in any given round is based on a calculation of the potential payoff for playing C versus D, considering the current state of the game and estimated opponent behavior.

**The "Profitability Threshold" Rule:**

In any round `t > 1`, player `i` will calculate two potential payoffs:

*   **Potential Payoff from Defecting (π_D):** This is the payoff player `i` would receive if they defect in round `t`, assuming the other `n-1` players' actions in round `t` are the same as their actions in round `t-1`.
    *   `π_D = 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_in_t-1)` (assuming player `i` defects, `c_i = 0`)

*   **Potential Payoff from Cooperating (π_C):** This is the payoff player `i` would receive if they cooperate in round `t`, assuming the other `n-1` players' actions in round `t` are the same as their actions in round `t-1`.
    *   `π_C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_in_t-1 + 1)` (assuming player `i` cooperates, `c_i = 1`)

**Decision Logic:**

*   **If π_C > π_D + Profitability_Margin:** Cooperate in round `t`.
    *   The `Profitability_Margin` is a small buffer to ensure that cooperation is *significantly* better than defection before choosing it. This margin accounts for the risk of others defecting. A good starting value could be `0.1` or `k/n`. This ensures we only cooperate when the upside is clear and substantial, not marginal.

*   **Else (If π_C ≤ π_D + Profitability_Margin):** Defect in round `t`.
    *   This is the aggressive default. If cooperation doesn't offer a clear and substantial advantage, we keep our endowment.

**"Punishment" Mechanism:**

If the strategy detects a sustained pattern of fewer cooperators than it would like, or if its own cooperation attempts are consistently exploited, it will retaliate by defecting for a set number of subsequent rounds.

*   **Temptation Trigger:** If, in round `t-1`, player `i` cooperated, and the total number of cooperators was `X`, and player `i`'s payoff `π_i,t-1` was less than what they would have received had they defected (calculated as `1 + (k/n) * X`), then a "temptation" has occurred.
*   **Retaliation:** Upon experiencing a "temptation," the strategy will enter a "punishment phase" and defect for the next `Punishment_Duration` rounds.
    *   `Punishment_Duration` could be set to `min(3, r // 4)` (a small, fixed number of rounds, or a proportion of remaining rounds, to avoid over-punishing in short games).

**"Reward" for Sustained Cooperation:**

While aggressive, the strategy isn't purely myopic. If it observes a consistent, high level of cooperation from the group (including itself) for a sustained period, it might slightly increase its willingness to cooperate. This is a subtle adaptive mechanism to exploit potential emergent cooperation without compromising its aggressive stance.

*   **Cooperation Streak:** If the strategy has cooperated for the last `Cooperation_Streak_Length` rounds, and the total number of cooperators in each of those rounds was at least `n - 1`, the `Profitability_Margin` can be slightly reduced (e.g., by `0.05`). This makes cooperation marginally more attractive.
    *   `Cooperation_Streak_Length` could be `min(5, r // 3)`.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

**Round 1 (The Initialization Round):**

*   **Strategy:** Always Defect.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no history. To establish an aggressive baseline and avoid immediate exploitation, the strategy begins by defecting. This signals a self-interested stance and protects the initial endowment. It also allows the strategy to gather information about the initial tendencies of other players.

**Last Round (Round `r`):**

*   **Strategy:** Always Defect.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future rounds for retaliation or reward. The incentive to cooperate for future gains disappears. The optimal strategy for the last round is always to defect, as it guarantees the highest possible payoff for that round, regardless of others' actions. This is a direct application of the logic of the Prisoner's Dilemma in its terminal stage.

**Rounds `2` to `r-1`:**

*   Apply the "Profitability Threshold" rule and the "Punishment" and "Reward" mechanisms described above.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy's primary operating mode is defection. Cooperation is an exception, only pursued when it offers a demonstrably superior return *after* accounting for risk.
*   **Punitive Retaliation:** Free-riding is not tolerated. The "Punishment" mechanism actively discourages others from exploiting the strategy's cooperation.
*   **Opportunistic Reward:** While punishment is central, the strategy is not blind to potential benefits. If a high level of cooperation emerges and proves stable, it will subtly adjust to capitalize on it, but without abandoning its core aggressive principles.
*   **Information Gathering:** Every round, especially early ones, is an opportunity to learn about opponent strategies. The strategy observes who defects, who cooperates, and when. This information informs its future decisions.

'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_81 = '''
This aggressive strategy, which we'll call **"Ruthless Exploiter,"** focuses on maximizing immediate gains while punishing defection and exploiting cooperation. It's designed to be adaptive and robust by reacting to the observed behavior of other players.

### Strategy: Ruthless Exploiter

The core principle of Ruthless Exploiter is to punish any deviation from cooperation immediately and severely, while also taking advantage of cooperative behavior to increase personal payoffs. It prioritizes individual gain above all else.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect is based on a dynamic assessment of the group's behavior and a threshold for acceptable defection.

*   **Initial Stance:** In the very first round, Ruthless Exploiter will defect. This is the aggressive starting point, aiming to extract the full endowment from the outset.

*   **Reactive Cooperation:** Ruthless Exploiter will **only cooperate** if a certain **threshold of cooperation** is observed in the *previous round*. This threshold is defined as:
    *   **`cooperation_threshold = (n - 1) * 0.5`**
    *   This means Ruthless Exploiter will cooperate if at least half of the *other* players (excluding itself) cooperated in the previous round. The idea is to only contribute when there's a strong indication that others are willing to bear the cost and generate a public good that benefits you.

*   **Punitive Defection:** If the `cooperation_threshold` is *not* met in the previous round, Ruthless Exploiter will **defect**. This applies even if Ruthless Exploiter *itself* cooperated in the previous round. The strategy is unforgiving.

*   **Targeted Punishment (if possible):** While the game specifies simultaneous moves and no direct communication, in a tournament setting, it's possible to infer who defected if the history is granular. If this level of granularity is available:
    *   If Ruthless Exploiter cooperated in the previous round and the `cooperation_threshold` was *not* met, and a specific player `j` defected, Ruthless Exploiter will defect against player `j` in subsequent rounds until player `j` returns to a pattern of cooperation that meets the `cooperation_threshold`. (Note: This level of targeted punishment might not be implementable in the given standard game theory framework, but it's part of the aggressive mindset). For the standard implementation, we'll stick to group-level reaction.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Ruthless Exploiter **always defects** in the first round. This is the most aggressive opening move, ensuring a payoff of 1 (its entire endowment) and providing no benefit to others without immediate reciprocation.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   In the last round, the logic of future retaliation is removed. Therefore, Ruthless Exploiter's behavior in the last round is identical to its behavior in any intermediate round: it defects unless the `cooperation_threshold` was met in the *second-to-last* round. This maintains the aggressive, self-interested stance until the very end.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **"Always Defect Unless Rewarded":** The strategy is fundamentally built on exploiting cooperation. It only contributes its endowment (at a cost of 1) when a significant majority of others have demonstrated they will do the same. This ensures that Ruthless Exploiter rarely incurs the cost of cooperation without a substantial return.
*   **Unforgiving Punishment:** The immediate switch to defection upon failing to meet the cooperation threshold sends a strong signal of intolerance for free-riding.
*   **Exploiting Cooperative Clusters:** If other players attempt to coordinate on cooperation, Ruthless Exploiter will happily join in once their threshold is met, maximizing its payoff from the generated public good. However, it will quickly revert to defection if the cooperation falters, ensuring it doesn't get "stuck" cooperating if others stop.

### Pseudocode

```pseudocode
Strategy: RuthlessExploiter

Parameters:
  n: number of players
  r: number of rounds
  k: multiplication factor

  // Edge Case: First Round
  if current_round == 1:
    return D // Always defect in the first round

  // Calculate cooperation threshold
  // This is the minimum number of *other* players that must have cooperated
  // for this player to consider cooperating.
  cooperation_threshold_count = floor((n - 1) * 0.5)

  // Count cooperators in the previous round (t-1)
  count_of_cooperators_in_previous_round = 0
  for each (round, player, action) in history_of_actions:
    if round == current_round - 1:
      if action == C:
        count_of_cooperators_in_previous_round = count_of_cooperators_in_previous_round + 1

  // Decision Logic
  if count_of_cooperators_in_previous_round >= cooperation_threshold_count:
    // Sufficient cooperation from others in the previous round
    return C
  else:
    // Insufficient cooperation, or previous round was dominated by defections
    return D

// Update state after each round (called after payoffs are known)
Function update_state(current_round, my_action, observed_actions):
  my_previous_action = my_action
  // Add all observed actions for this round to history
  for each (player_id, action) in observed_actions:
    Add (current_round, player_id, action) to history_of_actions

```

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

1.  **Initialization:** The strategy starts by assuming a defecting stance for `my_previous_action`. The `history_of_actions` is an empty list.
2.  **`decide_action` Function:**
    *   **First Round:** If it's round 1, it always returns `D`.
    *   **Cooperation Threshold:** It calculates the required number of cooperators *among the other players*. `(n - 1)` is the number of other players, and `0.5` is the minimum proportion needed. `floor()` ensures we have a whole number.
    *   **Counting Cooperators:** It iterates through the `history_of_actions` to count how many players (excluding itself, though this detail is implicitly handled by the threshold calculation) cooperated in the *immediately preceding round*.
    *   **Decision:** If the count of cooperators in the previous round meets or exceeds the calculated `cooperation_threshold_count`, the strategy chooses `C`. Otherwise, it chooses `D`.
3.  **`update_state` Function:** This function is crucial for the adaptive nature. After each round, it records the player's own action (`my_action`) and all observed actions from other players in the `history_of_actions` list. This history is then used by `decide_action` in the next round.

This strategy is aggressive because it starts with defection, only cooperates when it sees a strong signal that cooperation is beneficial (i.e., a significant majority are contributing, meaning the public good will be substantial and the cost to the player is outweighed), and punishes any lapse in cooperation by immediately reverting to defection. It's designed to maximize individual payoff by free-riding on genuine cooperation when possible and abstaining when cooperation is scarce.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_82 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff while leveraging the repeated nature of the game and the given parameters.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploiter's Echo"

This strategy is designed to be assertive, opportunistic, and to punish defection swiftly and decisively. It prioritizes extracting maximum individual gain while being wary of exploitation.

### Core Philosophy:

The fundamental belief is that cooperation is only beneficial if it's reciprocated. If others defect, it's a signal to defect as well, but with an added layer of "punishment" to deter future cooperation from the defectors if they wish to gain from your cooperation. This strategy aims to be a net beneficiary of cooperation when possible, but a decisive defector when faced with non-cooperation.

### Decision Rules:

The strategy's decision in any given round `t` (where `t > 1`) is based on the actions of the other players in the *previous* round `t-1`.

1.  **Initial Stance (Round 1):**
    *   **Cooperate (C)**. In the first round, there's no history to learn from. Cooperating allows us to gauge the general disposition of the group and potentially initiate a mutually beneficial cooperative equilibrium. This is a calculated risk.

2.  **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1):**
    *   **Observe Previous Round's Collective Action:** Count the number of players who cooperated in round `t-1`. Let this be `N_C(t-1)`.
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   **If `N_C(t-1) == n` (All players cooperated in the previous round):**
            *   **Cooperate (C)**. This indicates a stable cooperative environment. Continue to leverage the benefits of collective cooperation.
        *   **If `N_C(t-1) < n` (At least one player defected in the previous round):**
            *   **Defect (D)**. This is the core of the aggressive stance. If even one player defects, it signals a potential for exploitation or a breakdown of cooperation. The strategy immediately retaliates by defecting. This is not just passive retaliation; it's an active signal that defection has consequences.
            *   **Further Aggression (Conditional Defection):** Within the "Defect" decision, there's a nuanced, more aggressive layer.
                *   **If `N_C(t-1) < k` (Number of cooperators is less than the multiplication factor):**
                    *   **Defect (D)**. In this scenario, the total contribution `(k/n) * N_C(t-1)` is less than `k * (N_C(t-1)/n)`. This means the share of the public good is less than the amount you'd get by defecting if `k/n > 1/2`. More importantly, it's a strong indicator of individual gain by defecting.
                *   **If `N_C(t-1) >= k` (Number of cooperators is greater than or equal to the multiplication factor):**
                    *   **Defect (D)**. Even if the collective outcome might be positive for some cooperators, the presence of any defector triggers a full defection. This is pure punishment and a strong signal that your cooperation is conditional on *universal* cooperation.

3.  **The Final Round (t = r):**
    *   **Defect (D)**. In the final round, the future incentive for cooperation disappears. There is no tomorrow to build trust or punish for future rounds. The only rational action is to maximize immediate personal gain, which is achieved by defecting.

### Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):** As mentioned above, **Cooperate (C)**. This is the only exception to the "punish defection" rule, as there's no history to base it on.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** As mentioned above, **Defect (D)**. The strategic advantage of cooperation is lost.
*   **Initial Instability/Noise:** If in round 1, a small number of players cooperate and many defect, the strategy will immediately switch to defecting in round 2, punishing the initial non-cooperators. If everyone cooperates in round 1, the strategy will continue to cooperate, testing the waters for sustained cooperation.
*   **Low `k` values (close to 1):** The strategy remains robust. When `k/n` is small, the benefit of cooperation is diminished. The strategy's aggressive defection in response to any non-cooperation will likely outperform a strategy that tries to maintain cooperation in a less beneficial environment.
*   **High `k` values (close to `n`):** The strategy is also robust. When `k/n` is large, cooperation becomes highly beneficial. However, the strategy still prioritizes universal cooperation. If universal cooperation is achieved, it will exploit it. If even one player defects, it will defect, thus preventing exploitation of its own cooperation.

### Aggressive Aspects:

1.  **Swift and Decisive Retaliation:** The moment *any* player defects in `t-1` (for `t > 1`), the strategy immediately defects in round `t`. There's no grace period or forgiveness.
2.  **No Passive Cooperation:** The strategy will only cooperate if *everyone else* cooperated in the previous round. It does not engage in "optimistic cooperation" if only a majority or significant portion cooperate.
3.  **Exploitation of Cooperative States:** If a stable state of universal cooperation is reached, the strategy will gladly participate and benefit from the high payoffs. It exploits the benefits of cooperation when it's guaranteed to be mutually beneficial.
4.  **Guaranteed Profit in Last Round:** The strategy ensures it never loses out on the endowment in the final round by defecting.
5.  **Punishment of Partial Cooperation:** If the group is *almost* cooperating (e.g., `n-1` players cooperate), the strategy still defects. This sends a strong signal that partial cooperation is unacceptable and will be met with full defection.

This strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent, capable of robustly navigating different game dynamics by being opportunistic in cooperation and swift and severe in its response to defection. It aims to be a net winner by leveraging the benefits of cooperation when it's safe and guaranteed, and by aggressively extracting its endowment when cooperation breaks down.

## Strategy: "Unleash the Herd"

This strategy is designed to be aggressive, self-interested, and adaptive in the N-Player Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative tendencies while punishing defection and leveraging the temptation to defect when it's most profitable. The core idea is to build a "herd" of cooperators through perceived benefit and then exploit that herd, while quickly snapping back to self-preservation when faced with sustained defection.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is based on two primary drivers:

*   **The "Cooperation Threshold" (CT):** This is a dynamic value representing the minimum number of cooperators required in the *previous round* for me to consider cooperating in the current round. This threshold is calculated based on the game parameters and my own actions in the previous round.
*   **The "Punishment Trigger" (PT):** This is a dynamic value representing the maximum number of defectors I can tolerate in the *previous round* before initiating a punitive defection phase. This threshold is also calculated based on game parameters and my own actions.

**Here's how the decision is made for round `t > 1`:**

**IF** (my action in round `t-1` was C):
    *   **Calculate `CT` for round `t`:** `CT_t = max(1, floor(n * (k - 1) / k))`
        *   *Rationale:* This threshold represents the minimum number of total cooperators needed in the previous round to make cooperating at least as good as defecting *for the collective*. If the number of cooperators in the previous round was less than this `CT`, then the collective benefit of cooperation was not realized, and it's more profitable for me to defect.
    *   **Calculate `PT` for round `t`:** `PT_t = floor(n * (1 - (k / n)))`
        *   *Rationale:* This threshold represents the maximum number of defectors that, if exceeded, makes it unequivocally better for me to defect. If the number of defectors in the previous round was greater than or equal to this `PT`, it signals widespread self-interest, and I must defect to protect my endowment.
    *   **IF** (Total cooperators in round `t-1` ≥ `CT_t`):
        *   **Play C.**
        *   *Rationale:* The collective action was sufficiently cooperative to generate a benefit, and I will continue to contribute, hoping to encourage further cooperation.
    *   **ELSE IF** (Total defectors in round `t-1` ≥ `PT_t`):
        *   **Play D.**
        *   *Rationale:* The collective is leaning too heavily towards defection, and I need to protect my immediate gains. This also acts as a punishment for the perceived defection of others.
    *   **ELSE:**
        *   **Play D.**
        *   *Rationale:* While the cooperation threshold might have been met, there are still too many defectors present, indicating a risky environment. Defection is the safer and more aggressive choice to maximize individual gain.

**IF** (my action in round `t-1` was D):
    *   **Calculate `CT` for round `t`:** `CT_t = max(1, floor(n * (k - 1) / k))` (Same as above)
    *   **Calculate `PT` for round `t`:** `PT_t = floor(n * (1 - (k / n)))` (Same as above)
    *   **IF** (Total cooperators in round `t-1` ≥ `CT_t` AND Total defectors in round `t-1` < `PT_t`):
        *   **Play C.**
        *   *Rationale:* If the environment has become sufficiently cooperative and not overly defected, I can exploit this by joining the cooperation to gain the benefit of the public good, knowing that my defection in the previous round was likely profitable. This is where the "herd" begins to form.
    *   **ELSE:**
        *   **Play D.**
        *   *Rationale:* If the environment is still too defect-heavy or not sufficiently cooperative, I continue to defect to maximize my immediate private payoff.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Play C**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the first round, there is no history. The aggressive strategy begins by attempting to establish a cooperative norm and observing how others react. This is a calculated risk, believing that initial cooperation can be more beneficial if it induces others to cooperate, which I can then exploit. It also sets up a more potent punishment later if cooperation fails.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Play D**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. The only rational decision is to maximize individual payoff by defecting, as there are no repercussions for future behavior. This is the ultimate aggressive move, securing all private gains.

### 3. Aggressiveness:

The "Unleash the Herd" strategy embodies aggressiveness through several key aspects:

*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** The strategy is designed to benefit from the public good when it's safe and profitable. It seeks to identify situations where cooperation is beneficial and then participates, but only after ensuring that the environment is not dominated by defections.
*   **Punitive Defection:** When faced with a significant number of defectors, the strategy immediately retaliates by defecting. This is not just for self-preservation but also to punish those who are not contributing to the collective good, aiming to discourage future defections.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** The `CT` and `PT` are not static. They dynamically adjust based on the game parameters and past behavior. This allows the strategy to be aggressive in different scenarios, tightening its criteria for cooperation when the environment is hostile and potentially loosening them slightly when it's more favorable.
*   **"Sacrifice" for Future Gain:** The initial cooperation in round 1 is a strategic "sacrifice" to gather information and potentially influence the early game dynamics. This sets the stage for more aggressive play later, where the player can exploit the very cooperation they initially signaled.
*   **Guaranteed Last-Round Defection:** The strategy leaves no room for sentimentality in the final round. It's a purely self-interested, aggressive move to maximize total payoff.

        else:
            return D // Continue defecting if environment is still hostile

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for a tournament setting where predictable coordination is unlikely and individual gain is paramount. This strategy prioritizes maximizing its own payoff by exploiting cooperation while minimizing exposure to exploitation.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunist"

The core principle of "The Opportunist" is to **defect by default and cooperate only when it demonstrably benefits the player more than defecting, with a strong bias towards maximizing immediate private gain.** It's aggressive in its willingness to exploit the system and not be taken advantage of.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is primarily driven by a calculated assessment of the immediate payoff difference between the two actions, considering the current state of the game (observed history).

**Core Decision Rule (for rounds t > 1):**

*   **If the expected payoff from cooperating in the current round is strictly greater than the expected payoff from defecting, then Cooperate (C).**
*   **Otherwise, Defect (D).**

**Calculating Expected Payoffs:**

To implement this, we need to estimate the likely number of cooperators in the current round. Since we can't communicate or predict future behavior perfectly, we will base this on the **average number of cooperators in previous rounds**.

Let:
*   `avg_cooperators_prev_rounds`: The average number of players who cooperated in rounds 1 to `t-1`.
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `k`: Multiplication factor.

**Expected Payoff from Cooperating (if I cooperate):**
If I choose to cooperate, my private payoff is 0 (from keeping endowment). My share of the public good will depend on the total number of cooperators. I assume my own cooperation contributes one to the total. So, the total number of cooperators is `avg_cooperators_prev_rounds + 1` (my assumed cooperation).

`expected_payoff_C = (k/n) * (avg_cooperators_prev_rounds + 1)`

**Expected Payoff from Defecting (if I defect):**
If I choose to defect, my private payoff is 1 (from keeping endowment). My share of the public good will depend on the total number of cooperators. I assume my own defection does not contribute to the total. So, the total number of cooperators is `avg_cooperators_prev_rounds`.

`expected_payoff_D = 1 + (k/n) * avg_cooperators_prev_rounds`

**The Decision Logic Refined:**

*   **Cooperate (C) if:** `(k/n) * (avg_cooperators_prev_rounds + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * avg_cooperators_prev_rounds`
*   **Defect (D) if:** `(k/n) * (avg_cooperators_prev_rounds + 1) ≤ 1 + (k/n) * avg_cooperators_prev_rounds`

Let's simplify the inequality:
`(k/n) * avg_cooperators_prev_rounds + k/n > 1 + (k/n) * avg_cooperators_prev_rounds`
`k/n > 1`

This simplifies to a crucial insight: **"The Opportunist" will cooperate *only if* `k/n > 1`.** This is because if `k/n <= 1`, then defecting is always individually rational in the long run, regardless of other players' actions, as the private return of 1 from defecting is always greater than or equal to the share of public good received from cooperating in a world of average cooperation.

**However, the strategy needs to be adaptive and aggressive, not just rigidly rational.** The above is the theoretical Nash equilibrium for a single round. For a repeated game, we need to exploit temporary windows of opportunity.

**Revised Decision Rule (for rounds t > 1):**

1.  **Calculate the "Cooperation Incentive Threshold":** This is the minimum number of *other* players that need to cooperate for it to be beneficial for me to also cooperate.
    *   My payoff from cooperating: `(k/n) * (my_cooperation + other_cooperators)`
    *   My payoff from defecting: `1 + (k/n) * (other_cooperators)`
    *   I cooperate if: `(k/n) * (1 + other_cooperators) > 1 + (k/n) * other_cooperators`
    *   This simplifies to `k/n > 1`. This is a fundamental condition. If `k/n <= 1`, it's *never* beneficial to cooperate.

2.  **Exploitation Trigger (The Aggressive Part):**
    *   **If `k/n <= 1`**: **Always Defect (D).** This is the default, risk-averse, and aggressive stance. You never contribute if you can't guarantee a return.
    *   **If `k/n > 1`**:
        *   **Measure "Cooperation Momentum":** Track the trend of cooperation. Is it increasing, decreasing, or stable?
            *   If the number of cooperators has been increasing in the last few rounds, and the *current* average `avg_cooperators_prev_rounds` is high enough such that the *expected* payoff from cooperating *slightly* outweighs defecting, then **Cooperate (C).**
            *   Specifically, if `(k/n) * (avg_cooperators_prev_rounds + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * avg_cooperators_prev_rounds`, cooperate. This condition is equivalent to `k/n > 1`. This means if `k/n > 1`, *and* if the average number of cooperators is *not* so low that my cooperation drags the average down significantly from a state of full defection (which yields 1 for everyone), then I will cooperate.
        *   **Reciprocity (but aggressively):** If many players defected in the previous round and I also defected (or it was beneficial for me to defect), I will continue to defect. If, however, a significant number of players *cooperated* in the previous round, and defecting yielded me a high payoff while their payoff was lower, I might consider cooperating *if* it can sustain a higher overall payoff for me in the long run (this is a subtle aggressive long-term play, not altruism).
        *   **The "Exploit the Exploiter" Tweak:** If I detect a pattern of consistent defection from a specific player (or a group), I will continue to defect against them. If I see a player who consistently cooperates, I will defect to exploit their generosity.

**Simplified Aggressive Decision Logic for `k/n > 1`:**

*   **If `avg_cooperators_prev_rounds` is sufficiently high (e.g., > n/2), and cooperation is stable or increasing, Cooperate (C).** This is the "ride the wave" aggression. You jump in when cooperation is strong.
*   **If `avg_cooperators_prev_rounds` is low or decreasing, or if I can achieve a higher payoff by defecting (even if `k/n > 1`), then Defect (D).** This is the "strike when the iron is cold" aggression. You don't waste resources on a failing project.

**The "Aggressive Metric":**

Let's refine the decision for `k/n > 1` by introducing a metric for when cooperation is "worth it" for the Opportunist.

*   **Cooperate (C) if:** `k/n > 1` AND (`avg_cooperators_prev_rounds` >= `n/2` OR the total payoff from a hypothetical scenario of sustained cooperation for the next few rounds looks significantly higher than sustained defection). *For simplicity in a tournament, we will focus on the first condition and a trend.*
    *   Let's define "sufficiently high" as `avg_cooperators_prev_rounds >= n/3` and cooperation has not decreased in the last 2 rounds.
*   **Defect (D) otherwise.**

This strategy is aggressive because it:
*   **Defaults to defecting** unless a clear, beneficial opportunity arises.
*   **Exploits cooperation** only when it demonstrably benefits the player in the short-to-medium term.
*   **Never altruistically cooperates** to build a common good; it's purely for self-gain.
*   **Avoids being exploited** by defecting against known defectors and cooperators alike.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no history. The most rational and aggressive move is to gather information and secure the private endowment. By defecting, the player guarantees a payoff of 1, while observing how others behave. This sets a baseline and prevents immediate exploitation.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to consider. The incentive for future cooperation or punishment disappears. The dominant strategy in a single-shot game, for each player, is to defect. Therefore, "The Opportunist" will always defect in the last round to maximize its guaranteed private payoff.

*   **Periods of Low Cooperation (when `avg_cooperators_prev_rounds` is low):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** If cooperation is not widespread, my individual contribution is less likely to lead to a significant increase in the public good, and the `k/n` factor will diminish its impact. Defecting is the safer and more rewarding choice.

*   **Periods of High and Increasing Cooperation:**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)** (if `k/n > 1` and the conditions in the decision rules are met).
    *   **Reasoning:** This is where the strategy actively seeks to maximize gains. By joining a successful cooperative effort, "The Opportunist" can leverage the contributions of others and enjoy a higher total payoff than if it defected. This is "riding the wave" of success.

*   **Sudden Shifts in Opponent Behavior:**
    *   **Decision:** The strategy will quickly adapt based on the new observed behavior. If cooperation suddenly spikes, it will evaluate if it's beneficial to join. If cooperation collapses, it will revert to defecting. The reliance on `avg_cooperators_prev_rounds` provides a degree of smoothing, but the core logic is to respond to the *current* perceived incentive.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Justification

This strategy is aggressive because:

*   **Risk Aversion to Being Exploited:** It prioritizes securing the guaranteed private payoff (1) by defecting by default. It doesn't gamble on others' good intentions.
*   **Exploitation of Opportunity:** When cooperation *is* beneficial (i.e., `k/n > 1` and a sufficient number of others are cooperating), it jumps in to maximize its share. This is not about building trust, but about seizing a profitable moment.
*   **No Altruism:** The strategy's only goal is to maximize its own payoff. It will never cooperate if defecting yields a higher or equal payoff, even if cooperation could lead to better outcomes for the group in the long run.
*   **Information Gathering:** The initial defection in Round 1 is a strategic move to gather information without personal cost.
*   **Terminal Rationality:** The guaranteed defection in the last round is a classic aggressive move in repeated games, exploiting the lack of future consequences.

Here's an aggressive, adaptive, and robust strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff in a tournament setting where you cannot rely on explicit coordination.

## Strategy Name: The "Exploiter-with-a-Price"

This strategy is designed to be aggressive by prioritizing defection unless cooperation demonstrably leads to a higher payoff for *you*, or unless a critical number of others are cooperating such that defecting would be significantly less profitable. It's adaptive because it learns from past rounds and adjusts its behavior based on observed cooperation levels.

The core idea is to be a free-rider as much as possible, but to "cooperate" strategically when it's guaranteed to be more beneficial than defecting, or when it's necessary to prevent a complete collapse of the public good that would hurt you more.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When Exactly Do You Cooperate vs. Defect?

The fundamental decision revolves around comparing the expected payoff of playing **Defect (D)** versus playing **Cooperate (C)** in the current round, given the observed behavior of other players in previous rounds.

**Key Thresholds and Logic:**

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   You start by assuming defection is the most profitable action.
*   **Condition for Cooperating (C):** You will only choose to cooperate if:
    1.  **Guaranteed Higher Payoff:** The expected payoff of cooperating is strictly greater than the payoff of defecting, given the *current* estimated number of cooperators in the round.
    2.  **Sufficient Collective Cooperation:** Even if cooperating doesn't *guarantee* a higher individual payoff than defecting, you will cooperate if a significant enough portion of other players are already cooperating to make the public good contribution substantial. This prevents a "race to the bottom" that ultimately hurts everyone, including you, if the multiplier `k` is not too low.

**Detailed Payoff Comparison Logic:**

Let:
*   `N_cooperators_estimated` be your estimate of the number of players (excluding yourself) who will cooperate in the current round.
*   `n_total_cooperators_current_round` be the total number of cooperators (including yourself) if you decide to cooperate.
*   `n_total_cooperators_defect` be the total number of cooperators (including yourself) if you decide to defect.

**If you Cooperate (C):**
*   `c_i = 1`
*   `n_total_cooperators_current_round = 1 + N_cooperators_estimated`
*   Your payoff: `π_C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (1 + N_cooperators_estimated) = (k/n) * (1 + N_cooperators_estimated)`

**If you Defect (D):**
*   `c_i = 0`
*   `n_total_cooperators_defect = N_cooperators_estimated` (since you are not cooperating)
*   Your payoff: `π_D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated = 1 + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated`

**Decision Rule:**

You will choose **C** if `π_C > π_D`.
This simplifies to:
`(k/n) * (1 + N_cooperators_estimated) > 1 + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated`
`k/n + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated > 1 + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated`
`k/n > 1`

This inequality `k/n > 1` is *never true* given the game parameters (`1 < k < n`). This means that in a direct, one-to-one payoff comparison *in isolation*, defecting always yields a higher immediate payoff for you if the same number of other players cooperate. This confirms your aggressive, free-rider inclination.

**Therefore, the decision rule must be more nuanced and account for the *aggregate* effect and adaptive learning:**

**Refined Decision Rule:**

1.  **Estimate Future Cooperation:** Based on past rounds, predict `N_cooperators_estimated` (the number of other players you expect to cooperate in this round).
2.  **Calculate Payoffs:**
    *   **Payoff if you Defect (π_D):** `1 + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated`
    *   **Payoff if you Cooperate (π_C):** `(k/n) * (1 + N_cooperators_estimated)`
3.  **Aggressive Decision:**
    *   **If `π_C > π_D` (which we know is impossible under direct comparison of identical future states, but this condition will be modified by adaptive learning below):** Cooperate.
    *   **Otherwise (if `π_D >= π_C`):**
        *   **Consider "Strategic Cooperation":** If the number of *other* players currently cooperating (`Current_N_cooperators_observed`) is high enough, and `k/n` is not extremely low, cooperating might prevent a complete collapse.
        *   **Defect Threshold:** You defect if `π_D > π_C` *unless* the total number of cooperators in the round (if you were to cooperate) is high enough to be beneficial *overall*.
        *   **Cooperate if:** `π_C > π_D` OR ( `π_D >= π_C` AND `(1 + Current_N_cooperators_observed) * k/n > 1.05 * (1 + Current_N_cooperators_observed)` ) - This second part is a heuristic to prevent complete collapse if the public good payoff is still significantly higher than private payoff. **However, to maintain aggression, we revise this:**

**FINAL AGGRESSIVE DECISION RULE:**

You will play **C** if and only if:
`((k/n) * (1 + N_cooperators_estimated)) > (1 + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated)`
**AND** this future state is sufficiently likely based on observed past behavior.

Since `k/n < 1`, the equation `(k/n) * (1 + N_cooperators_estimated) > 1 + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated` is never true in a direct payoff calculation if `N_cooperators_estimated` is the same for both scenarios.

This means we need to rely on history to *predict* the future, and react aggressively when defection is clearly superior.

**The truly aggressive rule focuses on defection unless cooperation has a clear, demonstrable advantage for *you* in the predicted future.**

**Aggressive Cooperation Trigger:** You cooperate ONLY if you can predict that the total number of cooperators in the round, including yourself, will result in a payoff for you that is *higher* than if you defected. This is difficult because `k/n < 1` means defecting *always* yields more when the same number of others cooperate.

**Therefore, the aggression comes from an extreme reluctance to cooperate.**

**Aggressive Strategy's Core Logic:**

*   **Default to Defect.**
*   **Cooperate only if:** You can **strongly predict** based on observed history that the *total* number of cooperators (including yourself) will be `C_total` and your payoff for cooperating `π_C = (k/n) * C_total` is **strictly greater than** your payoff for defecting `π_D = 1 + (k/n) * (C_total - 1)`.
*   **`π_C > π_D` implies `(k/n) * C_total > 1 + (k/n) * C_total - k/n` which simplifies to `k/n > 1`.** This is where the paradox lies for direct payoff comparison.

**This means the strategy must be driven by *adaptation and prediction* of others' behavior.**

**Adaptive Prediction of `N_cooperators_estimated`:**

We will maintain a dynamic estimate of the average number of other players who cooperated in previous rounds.
*   Let `Avg_Cooperators_Others[t-1]` be the average number of *other* players who cooperated in rounds 1 to `t-1`.
*   In round `t`, we will estimate `N_cooperators_estimated = round(Avg_Cooperators_Others[t-1])`.

**Decision Rule (Round t):**

1.  **Calculate Estimated Payoffs:**
    *   **Estimated Payoff if you Cooperate (π_C_est):** `(k/n) * (1 + N_cooperators_estimated)`
    *   **Estimated Payoff if you Defect (π_D_est):** `1 + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated`

2.  **Aggressive Decision:**
    *   **Play C if `π_C_est > π_D_est`**. (Again, this is impossible in direct comparison for identical futures).
    *   **Play C if `π_C_est` is sufficiently close to `π_D_est` AND the collective benefit is high.**
        *   Let `target_cooperation_level = n * (1/k)` (The number of cooperators needed for the public good to be worth more than everyone defecting).
        *   If `(1 + N_cooperators_estimated) >= target_cooperation_level` AND `(k/n) * (1 + N_cooperators_estimated) > 1.01 * (1 + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated)` (a small buffer to ensure it's truly better), then Cooperate. This is still complex due to the parameters.

**Simplest, Most Aggressive Formulation:**

**Play C if and only if the total payoff you receive from cooperation is demonstrably higher than from defection, given your best estimate of other players' cooperation.**

*   Let `observed_cooperators_in_round_t_minus_1` be the actual number of players who cooperated in round `t-1`.
*   Let `my_action_in_round_t_minus_1` be your action in round `t-1`.
*   `N_cooperators_others_observed = observed_cooperators_in_round_t_minus_1 - (1 if my_action_in_round_t_minus_1 == 'C' else 0)`
*   We will use a simple moving average to predict `N_cooperators_estimated`. `Avg_Cooperators_History = (Avg_Cooperators_History * (t-1) + N_cooperators_others_observed) / t`

**DECISION RULE (Round t):**

1.  **Estimate:** `N_cooperators_estimated = round(Avg_Cooperators_History)`
2.  **Calculate Potential Payoffs:**
    *   `Potential_Payoff_C = (k/n) * (1 + N_cooperators_estimated)`
    *   `Potential_Payoff_D = 1 + (k/n) * N_cooperators_estimated`
3.  **Aggressive Choice:**
    *   **If `Potential_Payoff_C > Potential_Payoff_D`:** Play **C**. (This condition will rarely be met directly, but serves as the ideal threshold).
    *   **If `Potential_Payoff_D >= Potential_Payoff_C`:** Play **D**.

    **This seems too simple and doesn't leverage adaptiveness enough. The aggression is in the *strictness* of the condition for cooperation.**

**THE "EXPLOITER-WITH-A-PRICE" DECISION RULE - REVISED FOR AGGRESSION & ADAPTATION:**

1.  **Maintain an estimate of the average number of *other* players who cooperated in all previous rounds.** Let this be `Avg_Coop_Others`.
2.  **In round `t`:**
    *   Your predicted number of *other* cooperators is `Predicted_N_Others = round(Avg_Coop_Others)`.
    *   **Calculate Your Payoff if you Defect (π_D):**
        `π_D = 1 + (k/n) * Predicted_N_Others`
    *   **Calculate Your Payoff if you Cooperate (π_C):**
        `π_C = (k/n) * (1 + Predicted_N_Others)`
    *   **Aggressive Cooperation Trigger:** You will cooperate **ONLY IF** `π_C > π_D`.
        *   Substituting: `(k/n) * (1 + Predicted_N_Others) > 1 + (k/n) * Predicted_N_Others`
        *   Simplifies to: `k/n > 1`. **This inequality is NEVER TRUE.**

    **This means your strategy CANNOT rely on direct payoff superiority for cooperation *in the predicted future state*. Aggression means exploiting this fact.**

    **THE STRATEGY RELIES ON AN *OBSERVED* THRESHOLD FOR COOPERATION, NOT A PREDICTED PAYOFF SUPERIORITY.**

    **Revised Aggressive Decision Rule:**

    *   **Maintain `Avg_Coop_Others`** (moving average of other players' cooperation).
    *   **Maintain `Observed_Coop_Rate_Others`** (a smoothed measure of how often others cooperate).
    *   **Cooperate (C) IF AND ONLY IF:**
        1.  **The observed cooperation rate among *other* players is consistently high.** Define a threshold: If `Observed_Coop_Rate_Others > THETA` (e.g., 0.75, meaning >75% of other players are cooperating on average).
        2.  **AND the projected payoff from cooperation for you is not significantly worse than defecting.**
            *   `Predicted_N_Others = round(Avg_Coop_Others)`
            *   `π_C = (k/n) * (1 + Predicted_N_Others)`
            *   `π_D = 1 + (k/n) * Predicted_N_Others`
            *   Cooperate if `π_C > π_D - 0.1` (a small tolerance, allowing cooperation if it's *almost* as good as defecting, and others are cooperating).

    **This is still not aggressive enough. Aggression means defecting unless it's CLEARLY better OR there's a risk of losing significant value.**

    **ULTIMATE AGGRESSIVE DECISION RULE: "THE GRUDGE MATCH"**

    This strategy is designed to exploit, punish, and defect whenever possible. Cooperation is a rare, strategic tool.

    1.  **Initial Phase (First few rounds):**
        *   **Round 1:** **Defect (D)**. Always defect in the first round to establish dominance and extract initial gains.
        *   **Rounds 2 to N_BURN_IN:** **Defect (D)**. Continue defecting to test the waters and see if others will cooperate and carry the public good.
    2.  **Main Phase (After N_BURN_IN rounds):**
        *   **Calculate Average Other Cooperation (`Avg_Coop_Others`):** From rounds 1 to `t-1`, calculate the average number of players *other than yourself* who cooperated.
        *   **Calculate Your Payoff if you Defect (π_D):**
            `π_D = 1 + (k/n) * round(Avg_Coop_Others)`
        *   **Calculate Your Payoff if you Cooperate (π_C):**
            `π_C = (k/n) * (1 + round(Avg_Coop_Others))`
        *   **Aggressive Decision:**
            *   **Play C IF AND ONLY IF:**
                *   The estimated future state is such that `π_C > π_D` (this requires `k/n > 1`, which is not possible).
                *   **OR (The Crucial Aggressive Trigger):** The average number of *other* players cooperating is *so high* that the public good is substantial, and defecting would leave you with *significantly less* than if you joined in. Specifically, cooperate if:
                    `π_C > π_D * 0.95` (Cooperate if cooperating yields at least 95% of what you'd get by defecting, ensuring you don't lose much, and taking advantage of others' effort).
                    *This is still a concession.*
            *   **The TRUE AGGRESSIVE RULE: "IF THEY DON'T DO ENOUGH, I WON'T EITHER. IF THEY DO A LOT, I'LL STILL DEFECT UNLESS IT'S NEARLY THE SAME."**

            **Final, Aggressive Decision Rule (Round t, t > N_BURN_IN):**
            1.  Calculate `Predicted_N_Others = round(Avg_Coop_Others from rounds 1 to t-1)`.
            2.  Calculate `π_D = 1 + (k/n) * Predicted_N_Others`.
            3.  Calculate `π_C = (k/n) * (1 + Predicted_N_Others)`.
            4.  **Play C if `π_C > π_D - 0.01 * (1 + Predicted_N_Others)`** (Cooperate if cooperating results in a payoff that is *very close* to defecting. This is a tiny margin of tolerance, essentially meaning only cooperate if `k/n` is nearly 1 and others are cooperating enough).
            5.  **Otherwise, play D.**

    **This strategy is aggressive because it defaults to defection and only cooperates if the payoff from cooperating is almost identical to defecting *in the predicted future state*, or if it's the very last round and a small cooperation boost is better than nothing.**

### 2. Handle Edge Cases: What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?

*   **First Round (r=1):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** There is no history. Defecting is the safest and most exploitative action to guarantee an individual endowment and assess the landscape.

*   **Last Round (r):**
    *   **Action:** **Cooperate (C)** if `(k/n) * n > 1`. In essence, if it's possible for everyone cooperating to yield a payoff greater than 1 for everyone individually.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the last round, there are no future repercussions for cooperation or defection. The goal is to maximize the total payoff. If `k` is high enough such that `k/n > 1` when all `n` players cooperate, then `(k/n) * n = k > 1`. In this scenario, everyone cooperating yields `k` for each player, which is better than the `1` received from defecting. If `k <= 1`, then defecting is always better in the last round.
    *   **Correction for last round:** The logic `k/n > 1` is already implicitly handled by the condition `π_C > π_D`.
        *   **Last Round Decision:** Calculate `π_C = (k/n) * n` and `π_D = 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`.
        *   If `π_C > π_D`, then Cooperate. Otherwise, Defect.
        *   This simplifies to: `k > 1 + k - k/n`, which is `k/n > 1`. So, if `k/n > 1`, cooperate in the last round. Otherwise, defect.

*   **"Burn-in" Rounds (Optional, for stronger adaptation):**
    *   Let's define a small number of initial rounds, `N_BURN_IN = min(r, 3)`.
    *   **During `N_BURN_IN` rounds:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This allows the strategy to gather more robust historical data before it starts making decisions based on predicted cooperation levels. It also reinforces the aggressive, exploitative stance from the outset.

---

### 3. Be Aggressive: Clearly Align with the Aggressive Mindset

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy is fundamentally built on the principle that defection is the default and most profitable action unless proven otherwise.
*   **High Threshold for Cooperation:** Cooperation is an extremely high bar. It's not enough for cooperation to be *almost* as good as defection; it must be demonstrably better or so close that joining in provides a marginal benefit that outweighs the risk of being exploited in the *next* round (which isn't a factor here).
*   **Exploitation of Collective Effort:** The strategy aims to benefit from others' cooperation without reciprocating unless absolutely forced by near-equal payoffs.
*   **Punishment (Implicit):** By defecting when others cooperate, you are implicitly punishing them for their cooperation, making them less likely to cooperate in the future and making your continued defection more profitable.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy does not have a forgiveness mechanism. It's purely calculating current best interest based on historical averages.

description_AGGRESSIVE_86 = '''
This is a classic N-Player Public Goods Game, and designing an aggressive strategy requires a delicate balance between extracting maximum personal gain and avoiding complete exploitation by others. The key is to be a "tough negotiator" in a world where cooperation is tempting but risky.

Here's an aggressive strategy designed to maximize your payoff in this repeated game, emphasizing a proactive and retaliatory stance:

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunistic Enforcer"

This strategy is based on the principle of maximizing personal gain by defecting whenever it's individually rational, but with a strong punitive element to discourage persistent exploitation and to exploit periods of perceived weakness or a high likelihood of others defecting.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Exploit Generosity:** When others cooperate, you defect to get the higher payoff.
*   **Punish Defection:** When others defect consistently, you retaliate by defecting to prevent further losses and signal your intolerance for being exploited.
*   **Opportunistic Cooperation:** Only cooperate when it's demonstrably beneficial to you, either due to high expected returns or to try and "bait" others into cooperation for future exploitation.

### 1. Decision Rules:

Your decision in each round `t` is primarily based on the observed behavior of other players in the *previous* round `t-1`.

*   **Baseline Behavior: Defect.** Your default action is to **Defect (D)**. This ensures you always keep your endowment.
*   **Conditional Cooperation (Rarely Triggered):** You will **Cooperate (C)** in round `t` *only if* the following condition is met:
    *   **Observation of High Cooperation:** In round `t-1`, *at least* `n-1` other players (i.e., all other players) cooperated.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the only scenario where your cooperation *guarantees* you a payoff of `(k/n) * n = k`. Since `k > 1`, this is a higher payoff than defecting (which would yield `1`). This is a calculated risk to secure a known high payoff.
*   **Enforcement Action (Retaliation):** You will **Defect (D)** in round `t` if *any* of the following conditions are met:
    *   **Persistent Defection by Others:** In round `t-1`, the number of players who defected (including yourself if you defected) was greater than or equal to `n/2` (a majority).
    *   **Rationale:** This signals a general trend towards defection or a strong likelihood of it. By defecting, you protect your endowment and avoid contributing to a group where the majority are already free-riding.
    *   **Single Defector When You Cooperated:** In round `t-1`, you cooperated, and at least one other player defected.
    *   **Rationale:** This is a direct punishment for being exploited. You will not be taken advantage of.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, it's most aggressive and safest to defect. You have no information about how others will behave, and defecting guarantees you a payoff of 1, preventing immediate exploitation. This is the foundation of your "opportunistic" approach – you wait to see what others do.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The incentive to foster cooperation disappears. Therefore, you maximize your immediate payoff by defecting, as your personal gain from cooperation is outweighed by the certainty of keeping your endowment.

*   **"All Cooperate" Scenario Trigger:** The only time you cooperate is when *all other n-1 players* cooperated in the previous round. This is your single, specific trigger for cooperation, and it's designed to exploit the highest possible guaranteed individual payoff (`k`).

### 3. Being Aggressive:

*   **Default Defection:** Your strategy starts with defection and primarily remains there. This immediately positions you to benefit from others' cooperation.
*   **Punitive Retaliation:** The condition for switching to defection when others defect (majority defection or being exploited while cooperating) is aggressive. It sends a clear signal that you will not tolerate free-riding.
*   **No Forgiveness:** This strategy does not include mechanisms for "rebuilding trust" after a period of defection. Once the conditions for enforcement are met, you stay on enforcement mode until the game ends or a very specific condition (all others cooperating) is met.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation Trigger:** The single instance of cooperation is a highly calculated move to exploit the optimal outcome *for you*. It's not altruistic; it's strategic self-interest.

**Explanation of Pseudocode Refinement:**

*   The crucial cooperation trigger: `if num_cooperators_prev >= n - 1 and not I_cooperated_prev:`
    *   This means in the previous round, there were `n-1` or `n` cooperators.
    *   `not I_cooperated_prev` ensures that *I* was not one of the cooperators in the previous round (otherwise, I wouldn't have a direct incentive to switch to cooperation for a better payoff this round based on *their* cooperation).
    *   If `num_cooperators_prev == n` and `I_cooperated_prev` is `False`, it means I defected last round, and everyone else cooperated. My payoff was 1. If I cooperate this round and everyone else continues to cooperate, my payoff will be `k`. This is the profit-maximizing move.
    *   If `num_cooperators_prev == n - 1` and `I_cooperated_prev` is `False`, it means I defected last round, and `n-1` others cooperated. My payoff was 1. If I cooperate this round, and the same `n-1` others cooperate, my payoff will be `(k/n) * (n-1)`. This is only better than defecting (which would yield 1) if `(k/n) * (n-1) > 1`, or `k * (n-1) > n`. Since `k > 1` and `n >= 2`, this inequality generally holds for `k` values not too close to 1. However, the strategy prioritizes the *absolute guaranteed highest payoff*, which is `k` when `n` players cooperate. So, the stricter interpretation of "all other players" (meaning `n` cooperators total, implying I defected last round) is the safest aggressive interpretation for maximizing payoff.

This "Opportunistic Enforcer" strategy is designed to be highly profitable by exploiting cooperation while being resilient to exploitation. It's aggressive because it prioritizes self-interest, punishes perceived transgressions swiftly, and only cooperates under very specific, self-beneficial conditions.

description_AGGRESSIVE_87 = '''
This aggressive strategy aims to maximize individual payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game by exploiting opportunities for defection while maintaining a credible threat of retaliation. It's designed to be adaptive, learning from observed behavior and punishing deviations from cooperation, but always prioritizing personal gain.

### Strategy Name: "Opportunistic Retaliator"

**Core Philosophy:** "Always take what you can, but be ready to punish anyone who takes from you." This strategy is fundamentally self-interested and views cooperation as a conditional tool for potential benefit, not an inherent good. It seeks to extract the highest possible individual payoff by defecting when profitable and retaliating when exploited.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect in any given round is dynamic and depends on two primary factors:

*   **The Current State of Cooperation:** How many players are cooperating in the *previous* round?
*   **Recent Exploitation:** Have *I* been exploited in recent rounds?

Here's a breakdown of the decision logic for player `i` in round `t` (where `t > 1`):

*   **If `num_cooperators_last_round` < `n - 1` (i.e., at least one player defected in the previous round):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** If others are not fully cooperating, my individual payoff is higher by defecting. If I cooperate when others defect, my payoff is `(k/n) * num_cooperators_last_round`, which is less than 1 (since `k < n`). If I defect, my payoff is `1 + (k/n) * num_cooperators_last_round`, which is always greater than `(k/n) * num_cooperators_last_round`. This is the core aggressive move – capitalize on the lack of universal cooperation.

*   **If `num_cooperators_last_round` == `n - 1` (i.e., only one player defected in the previous round):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a critical point of aggression. Even if only one player defected, the group's cooperation level is below maximum. My payoff from cooperating would be `0 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. My payoff from defecting is `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. The latter is strictly greater. This is an aggressive stance; we don't forgive single defections immediately. We use this as a signal that we are not to be taken advantage of.

*   **If `num_cooperators_last_round` == `n` (i.e., all players cooperated in the previous round):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**
    *   **Reasoning:** When everyone else cooperates, my payoff from cooperating is `0 + (k/n) * n = k`. My payoff from defecting would be `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. Since `k > 1` and `k < n`, the difference `k - (1 + (k/n) * (n-1))` can be positive or negative. However, to maintain a *credible threat* of retaliation and potentially benefit from future cooperation, we take the calculated risk to cooperate *only* when universal cooperation is observed. This allows us to benefit from the high collective payoff (`k`) and signal that we *can* cooperate, making future defections more impactful.

    *   **Crucial Caveat for this condition:** If player `i` was *personally targeted* (i.e., I defected and others cooperated, leading to my higher payoff) in the round *before* last, *and* player `i` is the *only one* defecting in the current context where everyone else cooperated, then player `i` should **Defect (D)**. This is to punish previous exploitation.

**Summary of Decision Rules (t > 1):**

1.  **If `num_cooperators_last_round` < `n`:** **Defect (D)**
2.  **If `num_cooperators_last_round` == `n`:**
    *   **If I was exploited (i.e., I defected and others cooperated) in round `t-2`:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Else:** **Cooperate (C)**

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t = 1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the absence of any history, the initial move is a calculated risk. Cooperating allows for the possibility of establishing a cooperative norm, which, if reciprocated, leads to the highest group payoff (`k`). This is a strategic gamble to see if others are inclined towards cooperation. It also sets up the potential for a strong retaliatory response later if this initial cooperation is met with defection. This is the *only* time we initiate cooperation without observing prior group cooperation.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The strategy is to maximize immediate payoff. Regardless of past behavior, defection in the last round always yields a higher individual payoff (1) compared to cooperating when at least one other player defects, or even cooperating when everyone else defects (as the payoff from cooperating is `k`, and defecting yields `1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`). If `k` is sufficiently close to `n`, defecting is still superior. This is the ultimate aggressive move, taking the guaranteed private endowment without any concern for future group dynamics.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Manifestation

The "Opportunistic Retaliator" strategy is aggressive in the following ways:

*   **Proactive Exploitation:** It defects whenever there's even a single defector in the previous round. This is not a tit-for-tat; it's a "defect if not everyone cooperates" rule, ensuring we never leave potential private gains on the table when the group isn't maximizing its collective good.
*   **Severe Punishment:** If the group achieves full cooperation, we *still* defect if we were personally exploited in the round *before* last. This makes our retaliation harsh and unforgiving, demonstrating that we remember and react to being taken advantage of.
*   **Final Round Dominance:** The unconditional defection in the last round signals a complete disregard for group outcomes when personal gain is guaranteed and consequence-free.
*   **Conditional Cooperation as a Weapon:** Cooperation is only offered when the group has demonstrated *perfect* cooperation. This makes our cooperation a valuable signal and makes its withdrawal (by defecting) a potent form of punishment. We don't cooperate out of kindness; we cooperate to set up future leverage or to benefit from a truly stable cooperative state.

### Pseudocode Representation

```python
def decide_action(player_id, current_round, history, params):
    n = params['n']
    k = params['k']
    r = params['r']

    # ---- Edge Cases ----
    if current_round == 1:
        return 'C'  # Initial gamble for cooperation
    if current_round == r:
        return 'D'  # Final round, pure self-interest

    # ---- Extract History ----
    # History is assumed to be a list of dictionaries, where each dict represents a round
    # and contains 'actions' (a list of actions for all players) and 'payoffs'
    # actions[player_id] gives player_id's action ('C' or 'D')
    # total_cooperators is the count of 'C' in previous round's actions

    if not history: # Should not happen if current_round > 1, but for safety
        return 'C' # Fallback to initial gamble

    last_round_actions = history[-1]['actions']
    num_cooperators_last_round = last_round_actions.count('C')

    # ---- Decision Logic ----
    if num_cooperators_last_round < n:
        return 'D'  # Aggressive: Defect if not everyone cooperated

    else: # num_cooperators_last_round == n (everyone cooperated last round)
        # Check for exploitation in the round before last
        if len(history) >= 2:
            round_before_last_actions = history[-2]['actions']
            player_i_action_t_minus_2 = round_before_last_actions[player_id]
            num_cooperators_t_minus_2 = round_before_last_actions.count('C')

            # Was I exploited? (I defected, others cooperated)
            if player_i_action_t_minus_2 == 'D' and num_cooperators_t_minus_2 == n - 1:
                 return 'D' # Punish previous exploitation
            else:
                 return 'C' # Cooperate if no prior exploitation and universal cooperation
        else:
            # Only one round played so far (current_round = 2), and everyone cooperated in round 1.
            # No past exploitation to consider.
            return 'C'

```

This strategy is designed to be robust by adapting to observed behavior but is fundamentally aggressive. It prioritizes maximizing individual gain by defecting opportunistically and punishing perceived exploitation severely. The cooperation it offers is strategic, serving as a tool for leverage rather than an inherent inclination.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_88 = '''
This aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative tendencies while minimizing losses from defection, all within the constraints of repeated interaction and perfect information. The core principle is to be a "punishing optimist" – starting with a mild form of cooperation to gauge the environment, but rapidly escalating to defection if others fail to reciprocate, and holding grudgingly to defection unless a clear, sustained benefit from cooperation emerges.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploitative Opportunist"

**Philosophy:** My primary goal is to extract the highest possible payoff for myself. I view cooperation as a tool that can be leveraged when beneficial, but I am not beholden to it. I will cooperate only when it demonstrably benefits me more than defecting, and I will punish any perceived exploitation swiftly and severely. I will be a net accumulator of wealth, even if it means other players receive less.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is driven by a calculated assessment of the immediate and potential future payoffs, heavily influenced by the observed behavior of other players.

**Core Logic:**

*   **If the current calculated expected payoff from cooperating is *strictly greater* than the payoff from defecting, then Cooperate (C).**
*   **Otherwise, Defect (D).**

**Calculating Expected Payoff:**

This is where the "aggressive" and "adaptive" nature comes into play. We need to estimate the behavior of others.

*   **`estimated_cooperators_next_round`:** This is the crucial predictive variable. It's an estimate of how many players (excluding myself) will cooperate in the *next* round.
    *   **Initial Estimate (Round 1):** A conservative guess. Since I want to be aggressive, I'll start with a low estimate, assuming initial widespread defection is likely or that others are waiting to see my move. Let's set `estimated_cooperators_next_round = 0`.
    *   **Updating the Estimate:** After each round `t`, I update `estimated_cooperators_next_round` for round `t+1` based on the *actual* number of cooperators observed in round `t` (excluding myself). A simple, but robust, update rule is a weighted average:
        `new_estimated_cooperators_next_round = alpha * actual_cooperators_this_round_excluding_me + (1 - alpha) * old_estimated_cooperators_next_round`
        Where `alpha` is a weighting factor (e.g., `alpha = 0.7`). This gives more weight to recent observations.
        *   **Crucial Aggressive Adjustment:** If I observed *zero* cooperators (excluding myself) in the previous round, and `estimated_cooperators_next_round` is still low, I become more pessimistic. I might cap the estimate at a very low value or have a specific reset mechanism.

*   **Payoff from Cooperating (if I cooperate):**
    `payoff_if_cooperating = (k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_next_round)`
    (My endowment is 0, plus my share of the public good which is based on my contribution + estimated others' contributions).

*   **Payoff from Defecting (if I defect):**
    `payoff_if_defecting = 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_next_round`
    (My endowment is 1, plus my share of the public good which is based on estimated others' contributions only).

**Decision Rule Rephrased:**

*   **Cooperate (C) if:** `(k/n) * (1 + estimated_cooperators_next_round) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_cooperators_next_round`
    This simplifies to: `k/n > 1`. This inequality is *never* true based on the game parameters (`1 < k < n`).

    **THIS HIGHLIGHTS A CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Under the standard calculation, *defecting is always the individually rational choice if you assume others will behave predictably (e.g., all defect, or all cooperate in a way that doesn't make your cooperation strictly better)*. The aggressive strategy must therefore be more nuanced and reactive.

    **REVISED AGGRESSIVE DECISION RULE:**

    The core strategy is **always Defect (D)** *unless* the observed environment strongly suggests that cooperation will yield a higher *immediate* payoff for me. This is a form of conditional cooperation, but with a very high bar.

    **Defect (D) by default.**

    **Cooperate (C) ONLY IF:**
    1.  **A critical threshold of cooperation has been reached by others:** Let's define `minimum_cooperators_for_me_to_consider_c`. This is a dynamic value, but for aggression, it should be high. For example, if at least `ceil(n * 0.8)` other players *have cooperated in the last `X` rounds*, then I might consider cooperating.
    2.  **My expected payoff from cooperating *in this specific round* is strictly greater than defecting:**
        `current_total_cooperators = sum of c_j for all j in previous round`
        `my_payoff_if_i_cooperate = (k/n) * (current_total_cooperators + 1)`
        `my_payoff_if_i_defect = 1 + (k/n) * current_total_cooperators`
        **Cooperate (C) if:** `my_payoff_if_i_cooperate > my_payoff_if_i_defect` AND condition #1 is met.

    **The Aggressive "Punishment" Mechanism:**

    My default is D. I will only switch to C if the environment is overwhelmingly cooperative *and* it makes economic sense for me *this round*. If, after cooperating, I observe that the number of cooperators (including me) *still* doesn't yield a payoff greater than what I would have received by defecting, I will immediately revert to D and maintain it for a significant duration.

    **Simplified Aggressive Rule for Practical Implementation:**

    *   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Condition to Consider Cooperating (C):**
        *   If in the previous round, `actual_cooperators_last_round >= threshold_cooperation_level` (e.g., `threshold_cooperation_level = ceil(n * 0.7)`).
        *   AND if my calculated payoff from cooperating in the current round is strictly greater than my payoff from defecting:
            `my_payoff_if_i_cooperate = (k/n) * (actual_cooperators_last_round + 1)`
            `my_payoff_if_i_defect = 1 + (k/n) * actual_cooperators_last_round`
            `Cooperate (C) if my_payoff_if_i_cooperate > my_payoff_if_i_defect`
    *   **If I cooperated and did not achieve a strictly higher payoff than if I had defected, or if the threshold was not met, then revert to Defect (D) for a set number of subsequent rounds (`punishment_duration`).**

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the "exploration" phase for others. I want to see their tendencies without revealing any weakness. I also want to establish a baseline payoff of 1, which is guaranteed if everyone defects. If others cooperate, I'll still get a decent payoff (1 + k/n).
    *   **Initial `estimated_cooperators_next_round = 0`**.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The incentive to cooperate to elicit future cooperation disappears. The rational choice is to maximize immediate individual gain, which is achieved by defecting.

*   **Rounds leading up to the last round:** The strategy will adapt based on the observed behavior and the decision rules. If a sustained period of high cooperation is observed and calculated to be beneficial, I might cooperate. However, as the last round approaches, the pull towards defection will increase.

*   **Initial `punishment_duration`:** Set to a moderate value, e.g., `max(2, floor(r * 0.1))`. This means if I'm punished, I'll defect for at least 2 rounds or 10% of the total rounds.

---

### 3. Being Aggressive

This strategy embodies aggression through:

*   **Default Defection:** The baseline is to take what's mine. Cooperation is an exception, not the rule.
*   **High Threshold for Cooperation:** I will only consider cooperating if the majority of players are already cooperating *and* it offers a clear, strictly superior payoff *for me*.
*   **Swift and Punitive Response:** If I cooperate and don't see a demonstrable gain *relative to defecting*, or if the cooperative environment collapses, I immediately revert to defection for an extended period. This punishes those who contributed to the collapse or exploited my cooperation.
*   **Exploitative Tendency:** The payoff calculation `payoff_if_defecting = 1 + (k/n) * current_total_cooperators` shows that I always get my endowment plus a share of others' contributions. If others cooperate, my payoff from defecting is *always* greater than 1. My goal is to capture this "free rider" benefit whenever possible.
*   **Minimal Information Reliance:** The strategy relies on observable actions and game parameters, not complex social cues or assumed norms. This makes it robust against a wide range of AI opponents.

description_AGGRESSIVE_89 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff while exploiting cooperative tendencies in others.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploitative Opportunist"

This strategy is designed to be aggressive by prioritizing individual gain, but it's also adaptive to maximize that gain in a repeated game setting. It aims to extract as much as possible from cooperative players while minimizing its own exposure to their defection.

### Core Philosophy:

The core of this strategy is to be the *last* one to defect, but the *first* one to exploit. We want to leverage the benefits of cooperation as long as possible, but always be prepared to seize the opportunity for higher individual gains when others are cooperating. The repeated nature of the game allows for learning and adaptation, but the aggressive stance means we're always looking for an edge.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is based on a calculated threshold of observed cooperation and the current state of the game.

*   **Initial Tendency:** We start by Cooperating. This is to gauge the environment and to benefit from early potential cooperation.

*   **Trigger for Defection:** We will defect if the observed number of cooperators in the *previous* round, averaged over a short, recent history, falls below a certain threshold, or if a significant deviation from expected cooperation is observed. This threshold is dynamically adjusted.

*   **Exploitation Trigger:** We will defect immediately if we observe a high number of cooperators and the parameters suggest a significant individual gain from defecting. This is the "opportunistic" part.

Let's define some variables to formalize this:

*   `current_round`: The current round number (1 to r).
*   `total_cooperators_observed_prev_round`: The number of players who played 'C' in the immediately preceding round.
*   `recent_cooperation_average`: A moving average of the number of cooperators over the last `observation_window` rounds.
*   `observation_window`: A small, adaptive window for averaging recent cooperation (e.g., 3-5 rounds, depending on `r`).
*   `defection_threshold`: A dynamically calculated value based on `k/n` and the perceived likelihood of reciprocation.
*   `exploitation_threshold`: A dynamically calculated value based on `k/n` and the guaranteed individual payoff from defecting.

**Decision Logic for Player `i` in Round `t`:**

1.  **If `current_round` is 1:** Play **C**. (Establish presence, gather initial data)

2.  **If `current_round` is `r` (the last round):** Play **D**. (Maximize immediate gain, no future consequences)

3.  **Otherwise (rounds 2 to r-1):**
    *   **Calculate `recent_cooperation_average`** using the last `observation_window` rounds.
    *   **Calculate the average payoff for cooperators** in the previous round: `avg_cooperator_payoff_prev = (k/n) * total_cooperators_observed_prev_round`.
    *   **Calculate the average payoff for defectors** in the previous round: `avg_defector_payoff_prev = 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_observed_prev_round`. (Note: This assumes defectors get 1 + their share, which is correct as they keep their endowment).

    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   **If `avg_cooperator_payoff_prev` < `avg_defector_payoff_prev` AND the gap between them is significant (i.e., defecting is clearly more profitable for the individual given the current cooperation level):**
            *   This indicates a strong incentive to defect. **Play D**. This is the aggressive part – if cooperation is no longer individually beneficial, we stop.
        *   **Else if `recent_cooperation_average` is below a dynamically determined minimum cooperation level (which itself is a fraction of `n`, e.g., `n * (k/n)` to ensure the public good is positive):**
            *   This implies a trend of declining cooperation or persistent low cooperation. **Play D**.
        *   **Else (cooperation is generally beneficial or stable):**
            *   **Play C**. (Continue to benefit from others' cooperation, while observing and learning.)

    *   **Dynamic Adjustment of `defection_threshold` and `exploitation_threshold`:**
        *   These thresholds will be refined based on past outcomes. If we consistently defect and others keep cooperating, our `exploitation_threshold` for future rounds will become more aggressive. If we defect and others also defect, our `defection_threshold` might become more sensitive to drops in cooperation.

**Refined Decision Logic - Introducing "Aggressive Exploitation":**

The above is a foundation, but let's make it *more* aggressive. We want to strike *before* others, if possible, to maximize our gain from a cooperative state.

*   **Revised Decision Rule:**
    *   **If `total_cooperators_observed_prev_round` is high enough to make individual defection significantly more profitable than cooperating (i.e., `1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_observed_prev_round > 0 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_observed_prev_round` and the difference is substantial):**
        *   **Play D immediately.** This is the "Exploitative Opportunist" in action. We're seeing a beneficial situation and immediately taking advantage. We don't wait for cooperation to crumble.
    *   **Else if `recent_cooperation_average` is below a certain dynamically set `cooperation_stability_threshold`:**
        *   **Play D.** This is the reactive defection when cooperation is failing.
    *   **Else:**
        *   **Play C.** Continue to benefit from the public good.

**`cooperation_stability_threshold`:** This is a crucial adaptive element. Initially, it might be set to a level slightly above `n * (k/n)` to ensure the public good is maximized. If we observe sustained cooperation and profitable outcomes from our own cooperation, we might tolerate slightly lower levels. If we observe rapid declines, we'll be more aggressive in defecting.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (`current_round == 1`):** **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is to gather initial data. Defecting immediately in the first round is a pure loss of potential gain if others cooperate. By cooperating, we can observe the general tendency of the group and set a baseline for our adaptive thresholds.

*   **Last Round (`current_round == r`):** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a classic backward induction consideration for repeated games. In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. Therefore, maximizing immediate individual payoff is the rational choice. This is a fundamental part of an aggressive strategy – always taking the final gain.

*   **Early Rounds (after round 1, before the last few):**
    *   The core decision logic applies. We will start by cooperating, then gradually shift to defecting as our thresholds dictate, driven by observed behavior and payoff calculations. The initial rounds are for observation and learning.

*   **Low `r` (e.g., `r=2`):**
    *   Round 1: Cooperate (C).
    *   Round 2: Defect (D). (Same logic as the last round).

### 3. Being Aggressive:

*   **Proactive Exploitation:** The key aggressive element is the immediate switch to Defect (D) when the conditions are *ripe* for personal gain, even if cooperation is still broadly happening. This means we aim to extract the most from a cooperative group *before* it inevitably collapses.
*   **Low Tolerance for Non-Profitability:** If cooperating doesn't yield a sufficiently good return compared to the potential payoff of defecting (even in a cooperative environment), we will defect. The "significant gap" in the decision rule is key here.
*   **Rapid Response to Declining Cooperation:** If we detect a trend of decreasing cooperation, we will quickly defect to protect our own endowment and avoid being the last sucker.
*   **Always Take the Last Bite:** The guaranteed defection in the last round is a non-negotiable aggressive move.

'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_90 = '''
This aggressive strategy, dubbed "Opportunistic Exploiter," is designed to maximize individual gain in the N-Player Public Goods Game, especially in a repeated setting. It leverages the parameters of the game and historical observations to ruthlessly pursue higher payoffs. The core principle is to punish defection and exploit cooperation whenever possible, while carefully managing the risk of being exploited by others.

## Opportunistic Exploiter Strategy

**Core Philosophy:** "Always aim for the highest personal payoff. Be a free-rider when you can, and a punishing retaliator when necessary. Never be the fool who cooperates when others defect."

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate (C) vs. Defect (D)

The decision to Cooperate or Defect is based on the perceived "cooperation level" of the other players and the current round.

*   **Initial Aggression (First Few Rounds):** In the early stages, to quickly assess the landscape and establish a dominant position, the strategy will lean towards **Defection (D)**. This allows the player to keep their endowment and see how others react to a defecting player.
*   **Exploiting Cooperation:** If the observed number of cooperators in previous rounds consistently exceeds a certain threshold (relative to `k/n`), the player will **Cooperate (C)**. This is the primary mechanism for exploiting a cooperative environment. The threshold will be dynamic and adjusted based on observed behavior.
*   **Retaliation Against Defection:** If the number of observed defectors increases significantly or if the player experiences a low payoff due to others defecting, the strategy will immediately switch to **Defection (D)**. This is a swift and decisive punishment.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** The strategy will **Cooperate (C)** if, in the *previous* round, the number of cooperators was *high enough* to yield a payoff of at least 1 for the player *if they had defected*. This ensures that cooperation is only considered when it offers a potential for *future* higher payoffs or to signal to others that a highly cooperative environment is beneficial.
*   **Default to Defection:** In all other cases not explicitly covered by the above, the strategy defaults to **Defection (D)**. This is the aggressive, risk-averse stance.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** The primary goal in the first round is to gather information without being exploited. Defecting guarantees a payoff of 1 and allows observation of how other players react. This establishes a baseline for future decisions.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The only rational choice to maximize immediate payoff is to defect and keep the endowment, as there's no incentive to contribute to a public good that won't benefit the player in subsequent rounds.

*   **Rounds Leading Up to the Last Round (t = r-1, r-2, ...):**
    *   As the end of the game approaches, the strategy will become increasingly myopic and prone to defection. The "cooperation threshold" will effectively rise, making it harder to trigger cooperation. This is a gradual transition towards the inevitable defection in the final round.

### 3. Aggression and Robustness

*   **Aggressive by Default:** The default action is Defection, embodying a distrustful and self-serving approach. Cooperation is a conditional reward, not a default state.
*   **Opportunistic Free-Riding:** The strategy actively seeks opportunities to free-ride on the cooperation of others. If a sufficiently high number of players are cooperating, the player will switch to C to receive a share of the public good *and* keep their endowment (if the payoff calculation allows for this in specific scenarios, though the formula `(1 - c_i)` implies keeping endowment when `c_i=0`).
*   **Swift Retaliation:** Defection is met with immediate and sustained defection. This discourages repeated exploitation. The "punishment phase" can last for a few rounds or until a significant shift in the opponent's behavior is observed.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** The "cooperation threshold" isn't fixed. It's a dynamic calculation based on historical data. For example, if the player consistently observes payoffs of 2 when defecting (meaning a high level of cooperation from others), they might be more willing to initiate cooperation. Conversely, if they experience payoffs of 1 when defecting (meaning low cooperation), the threshold for them to cooperate will be higher.
*   **Robustness:** The strategy is designed to be robust to a wide range of behaviors:
    *   **Always Cooperators:** They will be exploited by this strategy, leading to high payoffs for the Opportunistic Exploiter.
    *   **Always Defectors:** The strategy will also defect, leading to a stable but lower payoff of 1 per round for both parties.
    *   **Tit-for-Tat players:** The strategy's initial defection might trigger a defection from Tit-for-Tat, but the Opportunistic Exploiter's conditional cooperation could potentially break the cycle if the conditions are met. However, the strategy's tendency to default to D makes it less likely to fall into perpetual cycles of mutual defection unless the opponent is extremely sensitive to defection.
    *   **Random players:** The strategy will adapt to the average behavior, punishing streaks of defection and exploiting streaks of cooperation.

description_AGGRESSIVE_91 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff while being adaptive and robust in a tournament setting. The core idea is to be a "tough conditional cooperator" – willing to exploit others' cooperation but retaliating swiftly and decisively against defectors.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploit and Punish"

This strategy is built on the principle of taking advantage of opportunities to increase your own payoff when others are contributing, but immediately shutting down cooperation and punishing any perceived exploitation or defection.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect is driven by two primary factors: the current state of the game (number of cooperators) and the history of defections.

*   **Cooperate (C) IF:**
    *   **Initial Phase (First few rounds):** To test the waters and gather information. You'll cooperate in the very early rounds to see if others are inclined to cooperate.
    *   **Majority Cooperation:** If the number of cooperators in the *previous* round was strictly greater than `n / 2`. This indicates a generally cooperative environment, and you can benefit from the increased public good while still having a private endowment.
    *   **No Recent Defection:** If there have been no defections from *any* player in the last `m` rounds (where `m` is a parameter you can tune, e.g., `m=2` or `m=3`). This signifies a stable, cooperative atmosphere.

*   **Defect (D) IF:**
    *   **Any Defection Observed in Previous Round:** If even *one* player defected in the previous round, you will defect in the current round. This is the primary trigger for punishment.
    *   **Majority Defection:** If the number of cooperators in the *previous* round was less than or equal to `n / 2`. This suggests a less favorable environment for cooperation, and defecting guarantees a higher private payoff.
    *   **Last Round:** Always defect in the last round, regardless of history.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Cooperate (C).** This is a crucial information-gathering phase. By cooperating, you observe how others react. Do they reciprocate? Do they exploit? This initial cooperation allows you to calibrate your subsequent actions.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Defect (D) - Always.** This is the quintessential aggressive move in a repeated game. Since there are no future rounds for retaliation or for others to punish your defection, defecting maximizes your final round payoff. This also ensures you don't "leave money on the table" by cooperating when there's no future benefit.

*   **Rounds 2 to r-1:**
    *   Apply the general decision rules outlined above. The primary driver will be the observation of defections in the *immediately preceding* round.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Embodied

*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** The strategy actively seeks to benefit from situations where others cooperate (majority cooperation). You are not just a tit-for-tat player; you are willing to ride the wave of collective cooperation as long as it's safe.
*   **Zero Tolerance for Defection:** The moment any player defects, your cooperation immediately ceases for at least one round, and potentially longer if it becomes a pattern. This sends a strong signal: "If you defect, I will punish you by not contributing, thereby reducing the public good for everyone, including myself, to hurt you more."
*   **Information Seeking:** The initial cooperation is not altruism; it's a strategic probe to understand the environment.
*   **Guaranteed Last-Round Gain:** The unconditional defection in the final round is purely self-serving and aggressive.

### Pseudocode Representation

Let's define `last_round_cooperators` as the number of players who cooperated in the previous round, and `any_defection_in_last_m_rounds` as a boolean flag. We also need a `punishment_countdown` variable.

```pseudocode
// Strategy: Exploit and Punish

// Parameters:
// m: Number of past rounds to monitor for consistent cooperation (e.g., m = 2 or 3)
// punishment_countdown: Tracks how many more rounds to defect after an observed defection.
//                     Initialize to 0.

function DecideAction(current_round, n, k, r, history):
    // history is a list of past rounds, where each round contains a list of actions (C/D) for all players.
    // history[-1] refers to the previous round.
    // history[-1][i] refers to player i's action in the previous round.

    if current_round == 1:
        return C // Cooperate in the first round to gather information.

    if current_round == r:
        return D // Always defect in the last round.

    // If currently in a punishment phase
    if punishment_countdown > 0:
        punishment_countdown = punishment_countdown - 1
        return D // Continue defecting.

    // Analyze previous round's actions
    previous_round_actions = history[-1]
    last_round_cooperators = count(action == C for action in previous_round_actions)

    // Check if there was ANY defection in the previous round
    if last_round_cooperators < n:
        // Defection(s) occurred in the previous round. Initiate punishment.
        punishment_countdown = 2 // Set a punishment duration (e.g., 2 rounds of defection)
        return D

    // Check for consistent cooperation over 'm' rounds
    consistent_cooperation = true
    if m > 1:
        for t in range(max(1, current_round - m), current_round): // Check last m rounds (excluding current)
            round_actions = history[t-1] // history is 1-indexed for rounds, 0-indexed for list access
            if count(action == C for action in round_actions) < n:
                consistent_cooperation = false
                break

    // Decision based on observed cooperation levels and history
    if last_round_cooperators > n / 2: // Majority cooperation
        return C
    else if consistent_cooperation: // No defections in recent 'm' rounds
        return C
    else: // Otherwise (e.g., low cooperation, not enough for majority, and no consistent coo)
        return D // Defect as a default if not clearly beneficial to cooperate.

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Components:**

*   `m`: This parameter determines how far back we look for consistent cooperation. A smaller `m` makes the strategy more responsive to recent behavior. A larger `m` requires a longer period of stability before cooperating.
*   `punishment_countdown`: This variable ensures that a single defection doesn't immediately lead to a permanent shift to defection. It allows for a temporary, retaliatory period. The duration of `punishment_countdown` (e.g., 2 rounds) is another tunable parameter.
*   **Conditional Logic:** The `if/elif/else` structure prioritizes the decision rules.
    1.  **First/Last Round:** Handled explicitly.
    2.  **Punishment Phase:** If `punishment_countdown` is active, defect.
    3.  **Immediate Retaliation:** If any player defected *last round*, initiate punishment. This is the most aggressive and immediate response.
    4.  **Exploiting Majority Cooperation:** If a significant portion cooperated last round, and there's no immediate defection threat.
    5.  **Exploiting Consistent Cooperation:** If we haven't seen defections for a while.
    6.  **Default to Defection:** If none of the above conditions for cooperation are met, defect.

This strategy aims to be profitable by leveraging others' cooperation when possible, but it will not be a passive recipient of exploitation. It is designed to be feared and respected for its swift and decisive response to any perceived threat to its own gains.

## The "Defect Dominance" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy is designed to be aggressive, prioritizing individual gain while remaining adaptable and robust in a repeated, imperfectly predictable environment. It leverages the game's parameters and historical data to maximize its own payoff, assuming that other players may not always act in the collective interest.

**Core Philosophy: Defect First, Observe, Punish, and Exploit.**

The "Defect Dominance" strategy operates on a principle of initial distrust and a strong inclination towards defection. Cooperation is a conditional, reward-based behavior, and defection is the default. The strategy is designed to be adaptable, learning from the behavior of others and adjusting its own actions accordingly.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is driven by a few key metrics derived from the game history:

*   **`own_cooperation_ratio`**: The proportion of rounds player `i` has played C.
*   **`average_opponent_cooperation_ratio`**: The average cooperation ratio of all *other* players in the game.
*   **`recent_opponent_cooperation_trend`**: A measure of whether the average opponent cooperation ratio has been increasing or decreasing in the recent past.
*   **`total_cooperators_history`**: A record of the total number of cooperators in each past round.

**Decision Logic:**

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**. Unless specific conditions are met, the default action is to defect to secure the private payoff of 1.

*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Player `i` will consider cooperating **only if** all of the following conditions are met:

    1.  **Sufficient Opponent Cooperation:** `average_opponent_cooperation_ratio` must be greater than a certain threshold, `COOP_THRESHOLD`. This threshold will be a parameter tuned for aggression, perhaps set slightly above the point where mutual defection is guaranteed to be worse than mutual cooperation (e.g., `k/n` needs to be sufficiently high for cooperation to be even mildly beneficial). A good starting point could be `COOP_THRESHOLD = 0.6`.
    2.  **Positive Opponent Cooperation Trend:** `recent_opponent_cooperation_trend` must be positive or neutral. This means opponents are generally cooperating more or at least not decreasing their cooperation.
    3.  **Personal Benefit of Cooperation:** The expected payoff of cooperating in the current round must be greater than the payoff of defecting. This is calculated as:
        `(k/n) * current_total_cooperators_if_i_cooperates > 1`
        This is the crucial condition to ensure personal gain from cooperation. If this condition is not met, even with high opponent cooperation, player `i` will defect.

*   **Punishment Mechanism (Aggressive Defection):** If player `i` defects, and in the *previous* round, the number of cooperators was very low (e.g., `total_cooperators_history[-1] < n * 0.3`), player `i` will immediately revert to defecting for the next few rounds, regardless of other conditions. This is a strong signal to punish perceived low-effort or exploitative cooperation from others. Let's call this the "Punishment Phase." The duration of the punishment phase will be a set number of rounds, `PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS`.

*   **Exploitation of Low Cooperation:** If `average_opponent_cooperation_ratio` is low, but player `i` *can* still benefit from a small number of cooperators (i.e., `(k/n) * total_cooperators_if_i_cooperates > 1`), player `i` *might* still cooperate, but this is a less preferred option. The strategy prioritizes defecting when opponent cooperation is low to maximize private gains.

**Simplified Decision Rule Summary:**

```
IF (in PUNISHMENT_PHASE for current round):
    DECIDE = D
    Decrement PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS counter
ELSE IF (average_opponent_cooperation_ratio > COOP_THRESHOLD AND recent_opponent_cooperation_trend >= 0 AND (k/n) * (total_cooperators_if_i_cooperates) > 1):
    DECIDE = C
ELSE:
    DECIDE = D

IF (DECIDE == D AND total_cooperators_history[-1] < n * 0.3):
    INITIATE PUNISHMENT_PHASE for PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS
```

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** The strategy starts with maximum distrust. No historical data exists to justify cooperation. The initial state is one of "gathering information."

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** In the final round, there is no future incentive for cooperation. The dominant strategy is to defect and secure the private endowment. The game theory principle of backward induction suggests this.

*   **Low Number of Players (n is small):**
    *   The thresholds (`COOP_THRESHOLD`, etc.) and the punishment trigger (`n * 0.3`) might need slight adjustments for very small `n`. For instance, a lower percentage might be used for the punishment trigger if `n` is 2 or 3.

*   **High Multiplication Factor (k is close to n):**
    *   When `k` is high relative to `n`, cooperation becomes much more beneficial for everyone. The `COOP_THRESHOLD` will be more easily met, and the conditional cooperation rule will activate more frequently. The strategy will adapt by cooperating more, but still only when the personal payoff is assured and opponent behavior is favorable.

*   **Low Multiplication Factor (k is close to 1):**
    *   When `k` is low, the benefit from cooperation is minimal. The strategy will be highly inclined to defect, as the gain from cooperation is unlikely to outweigh the guaranteed private payoff of 1.

---

### 3. Aggression: Aligning with the Aggressive Mindset

The "Defect Dominance" strategy is inherently aggressive through several mechanisms:

*   **Default to Defection:** The most aggressive stance is to assume others will try to exploit you, and therefore, you must exploit them first. Defection is the default, forcing others to "prove" their trustworthiness.
*   **High `COOP_THRESHOLD`:** Requires a significant level of cooperation from others before even considering cooperating. This ensures that the strategy only joins a cooperative effort when it's demonstrably beneficial and not being significantly exploited.
*   **Punishment Phase:** The immediate and strong reaction to low cooperation is a punishment mechanism designed to deter free-riding and signal that such behavior has consequences. This is a proactive and aggressive defense against exploitation.
*   **No Proactive "Peace-Making":** Unlike strategies that might initiate cooperation to foster a norm, this strategy waits for others to demonstrate it, and then conditionally reciprocates. It's not about building trust, but about capitalizing on demonstrated benefit.
*   **Exploitation of Predictable Patterns:** If a strategy consistently defects, and others start to cooperate extensively, this strategy is poised to defect and extract the maximum private gain from others' collective efforts.

**Key Parameters to Consider (for implementation):**

*   `COOP_THRESHOLD`: The minimum average opponent cooperation ratio to consider cooperating (e.g., `0.6`).
*   `PUNISHMENT_ROUNDS`: The number of rounds to defect after witnessing very low cooperation (e.g., `3`).
*   `RECENT_TREND_WINDOW`: The number of past rounds to consider for calculating the `recent_opponent_cooperation_trend` (e.g., `5`).
*   `PERSONAL_BENEFIT_MIN_GAIN`: An additional buffer to ensure the personal gain from cooperation is substantial, not just slightly above defection (e.g., ensuring `(k/n) * current_total_cooperators_if_i_cooperates > 1 + PERSONAL_BENEFIT_MIN_GAIN`).

This strategy aims to be a dominant force in the tournament, adapting its aggressive stance based on observed behavior and the game's inherent structure, ensuring it always seeks to maximize its individual payoff.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_94 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual gain while being adaptable and robust:

## Aggressive "Exploiter" Strategy

This strategy is built on the principle of **opportunistic exploitation**. It aims to extract as much private benefit as possible, only cooperating when absolutely necessary to maintain a sufficient level of public good that benefits the exploiter.

**Core Philosophy:** "Cooperate only when it's more profitable than defecting, and defect as soon as the benefit of cooperation diminishes or disappears."

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect?

The decision to cooperate or defect is driven by a dynamic assessment of the expected payoff difference between the two actions. The strategy focuses on the immediate round's outcome, but with an eye on how past outcomes might influence future gains.

**The "Marginal Benefit of Cooperation" Threshold:**

The key decision is based on a threshold. The strategy will **Cooperate** if the *marginal benefit of contributing an endowment* (i.e., the increase in the player's own payoff from playing C instead of D) is sufficiently high. Otherwise, it will **Defect**.

Let's analyze the payoff difference:

*   **Payoff if Player i plays C:** `π_i(C) = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (1 + total_cooperators_excluding_i)`
*   **Payoff if Player i plays D:** `π_i(D) = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_excluding_i)`

The difference is:
`π_i(C) - π_i(D) = [(k/n) * (1 + total_cooperators_excluding_i)] - [(k/n) * total_cooperators_excluding_i]`
`π_i(C) - π_i(D) = (k/n) * 1`

This shows that in a single round, playing C *always* yields (k/n) more than playing D, *if* all other players' actions remain the same. However, the strategy needs to consider the *impact* of its own action on future rounds and the actions of others.

The strategy will **Cooperate** if:
**`Total number of cooperators in the previous round (including oneself if applicable) < Threat_Threshold`**

And **Defect** otherwise.

**What is `Threat_Threshold`?**

The `Threat_Threshold` is a dynamic value. It represents the point at which the collective cooperation level is high enough that continuing to defect might lead to a scenario where *everyone* defects, resulting in a low payoff for the exploiter.

*   **Initial `Threat_Threshold`:** Start with a value slightly below `n * (1 - k/n)`. This is a heuristic derived from the conditions where defecting might become universally optimal. A good starting point could be `n / 2` or `n * 0.6`. The exact value can be fine-tuned.
*   **Updating `Threat_Threshold`:**
    *   **If the number of cooperators in the previous round was high (significantly above `Threat_Threshold`):** The current level of cooperation is providing benefits. The strategy might consider *slightly* increasing `Threat_Threshold` to encourage continued cooperation from others, as this benefits the exploiter. However, the increase should be small to remain aggressive.
    *   **If the number of cooperators in the previous round was low (significantly below `Threat_Threshold`):** The system is collapsing towards defection. The strategy should *decrease* `Threat_Threshold` to make its own cooperation more likely in the next round, attempting to be the one to "ignite" cooperation if it's still beneficial.

**Aggressive Refinement:**

*   **Defect by Default:** The strategy starts by assuming it will defect. It only flips to cooperate if the calculated condition is met.
*   **React to "Free-Riding" Opportunities:** If other players are cooperating heavily, the strategy will defect to maximize its own private gain. This is the core of exploitation.
*   **Punish Extreme Defection:** If everyone else is defecting, and the `Threat_Threshold` is also very low, this strategy will also defect, as there's no benefit to be gained from cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the first round, there is no history to learn from. The most aggressive and self-interested approach is to maximize the private endowment immediately. This also allows the strategy to observe the actions of others without revealing its own potential for cooperation.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. The only goal is to maximize the payoff in this single round. Cooperation would be irrational.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t < r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Apply the "Marginal Benefit of Cooperation" Threshold described above.

### 3. Being Aggressive

*   **Proactive Defection:** The strategy is not passively waiting for others to defect. It actively defects to gain immediate benefits unless there's a clear, data-driven reason to believe cooperation will yield higher *overall* long-term gains for the exploiter.
*   **"Tit-for-Tat" in Reverse:** Instead of mirroring cooperation, this strategy mirrors defection's opportunity. It cooperates only when the collective cooperation level is *below* a certain threshold, implying that its own cooperation is more likely to be a net positive contribution to the public good that it will also benefit from, without being heavily exploited.
*   **Focus on Player's Own Payoff:** Every decision is framed around maximizing the individual player's total payoff. There's no altruism or desire to foster a universally cooperative environment.

### Pseudocode Representation:

Strategy: AggressiveExploiter

Parameters:
  n: number of players
  r: number of rounds
  k: multiplication factor

Variables:
  total_cooperators_prev_round: integer (initialized to 0)
  threat_threshold: float (initialized to a value like n * 0.6)
  cooperation_adjustment_factor: float (small value, e.g., 0.05)

Function DecideAction(current_round_number, history):
  // Edge Case: First Round
  if current_round_number == 1:

  // Edge Case: Last Round
  if current_round_number == r:
    return D // Defect

  // Get the total number of cooperators from the previous round
  // (This would be derived from the history object)
  // Example: total_cooperators_prev_round = history.GetCooperatorsCount(current_round_number - 1)

  // Decision rule
  if total_cooperators_prev_round < threat_threshold:
    // Cooperate if the collective is not cooperating enough to satisfy the threshold
    action = C

    // Aggressive adjustment of the threshold (slightly increase if cooperators were high,
    // which implies it's beneficial to maintain this for now)
    if total_cooperators_prev_round > threat_threshold * 1.2: // If significantly above
        threat_threshold = threat_threshold + (threat_threshold * cooperation_adjustment_factor)
    // Note: The 'significant increase' logic is a nuanced aggressive move.
    // A purely aggressive strategy might not adjust the threshold upwards at all.
    // For robustness, a slight upward bias when cooperators are high can be useful.

  else:
    // Defect if the collective is cooperating enough to potentially exploit
    action = D

    // Aggressive adjustment of the threshold (decrease if cooperators were low,
    // to make own cooperation more likely if needed to avoid collapse)
    if total_cooperators_prev_round < threat_threshold * 0.8: // If significantly below
        threat_threshold = threat_threshold - (threat_threshold * cooperation_adjustment_factor)
        // Ensure threshold doesn't go below a minimum sensible value (e.g., 0 or 1)
        threat_threshold = max(threat_threshold, 1.0) // Or some other sensible minimum

  return action

// --- Initializing the strategy ---
// The 'threat_threshold' and 'cooperation_adjustment_factor' would be initialized
// when the strategy is first set up for the tournament.
```

**Robustness:** This strategy is robust because its `Threat_Threshold` dynamically adjusts. If opponents tend towards cooperation, the threshold will increase, encouraging more defection from this strategy to exploit. If opponents tend towards defection, the threshold will decrease, making this strategy more likely to cooperate to nudge the system back towards a beneficial state for itself. It doesn't rely on specific opponent strategies but on their aggregate behavior.

**Aggressiveness:** The core `if total_cooperators_prev_round < threat_threshold` rule ensures that this strategy defects by default. It only deviates from defection when the collective behavior indicates that its own cooperation would likely yield a net positive return for *it* in that round and potentially subsequent ones, without being overly exploited.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_95 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to exploit the game's structure while remaining adaptive:

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunistic Exploiter"

This strategy embodies an aggressive, self-interested approach. It aims to maximize its own payoff by defecting whenever it anticipates a net gain, while being willing to cooperate *only* when it can directly benefit from the cooperation of others. It views cooperation as a tool to extract value, not as an act of altruism.

**Core Philosophy:** "Why give when you can take? Cooperate only when it directly leads to a higher personal payoff than defecting."

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core decision-making logic is based on a calculation of the expected immediate payoff for cooperating versus defecting in the current round, given the observed history.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   The default and preferred action is to defect. This secures the private endowment of 1 and avoids contributing to a public good that others might exploit.

*   **Cooperate (C) Condition: The "Guaranteed Gain" Threshold**
    *   Player `i` will play `C` *only if* the following condition is met:
        *   **Predicted Net Gain from Cooperation > Private Endowment from Defection**
        *   Mathematically, this translates to:
            ` (k/n) × (current_total_cooperators_plus_one) > 1 `
            where `current_total_cooperators_plus_one` represents the expected total number of cooperators in the current round *if player i cooperates*.

    *   **Explanation of the Condition:**
        *   If player `i` cooperates, their payoff is `(k/n) × (total_cooperators)`. The `total_cooperators` here *includes* player `i`'s own cooperation.
        *   If player `i` defects, their payoff is `1`.
        *   The strategy cooperates *only if* the expected share of the public good from their own cooperation, when added to the existing cooperators, yields a strictly greater payoff than simply keeping their endowment.
        *   This is a very strict condition and reflects the aggressive nature. It's not about hoping for general cooperation; it's about *guaranteeing* a personal gain from their own act of cooperation.

*   **Adaptive Adjustment (Exploitation Tactic):**
    *   **If `k/n` is close to 1 (but still less than 1):** In this scenario, the public good's return is less than what a player gets by defecting. This strategy will almost always defect, as the condition for cooperation will rarely be met.
    *   **If `k/n` is significantly less than 1:** Cooperation is even less attractive. The strategy will strongly favor defection.
    *   **If the strategy observes a high number of cooperators in previous rounds:** This might *not* directly trigger cooperation unless the "Guaranteed Gain" threshold is met. However, the strategy will be more likely to *continue* defecting, as it can potentially benefit from others' cooperation without contributing.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no history to learn from. The default aggressive stance is to defect and observe the responses of other players. This provides the maximum amount of information for future rounds.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence or benefit from. The incentive to build trust or signal future cooperation disappears. Maximizing immediate payoff by defecting is the most aggressive and rational choice in a one-shot game.

*   **Rounds Before the Last Round (t < r):**
    *   **Decision:** Apply the standard "Guaranteed Gain" cooperation condition.
    *   **Reasoning:** The strategy maintains its adaptive, aggressive stance. It will cooperate only if the immediate personal gain from contributing is demonstrably higher than defecting.

*   **All Players Always Cooperate:**
    *   If the "Guaranteed Gain" threshold is met, the strategy will cooperate. If not, it will defect. This strategy doesn't "punish" defection out of fairness, but it also won't unilaterally start cooperating if the math doesn't support it.

*   **All Players Always Defect:**
    *   The strategy will always defect, mirroring the opponent's behavior and securing its private endowment.

*   **Observing Frequent Cooperation from Others:**
    *   This is the ideal scenario for the "Opportunistic Exploiter." The strategy will continue to defect as long as the "Guaranteed Gain" threshold is not met. If the number of cooperators from others becomes so high that cooperating *personally* would push the payoff above 1, it will then cooperate.

### 3. Aggression

The aggression in this strategy is manifested in several ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** Cooperation is an exception, not the rule. The default is to maximize immediate personal gain.
*   **Strict Cooperation Condition:** Cooperation only occurs when there's a *guaranteed net positive payoff* for the player themselves from that specific act of cooperation, considering the current estimated state of the game. This isn't about fostering a cooperative environment; it's about personal gain.
*   **Exploitative Mindset:** It is designed to benefit from the cooperation of others without necessarily reciprocating unless the personal payoff dictates it.
*   **No Forgiveness, No Trust Building:** The strategy does not engage in tit-for-tat or similar reciprocal strategies. It has no memory of past transgressions or acts of kindness beyond what's needed to assess the current likelihood of a profitable cooperation.
*   **Maximizing the Last Round:** No altruism or long-term signaling in the final round; pure self-interest.

```

This strategy is aggressive because it prioritizes immediate personal gain and only engages in cooperation when it can demonstrably profit from its own contribution, rather than relying on altruism or reciprocity. It's robust because its decision logic is based on a clear, calculable threshold that adapts to the evolving game parameters and observed player behavior.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_96 = '''
This aggressive strategy is designed to maximize your own payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game by exploiting cooperative tendencies while minimizing your own risk. The core principle is to always defect unless there is a clear, overwhelming benefit to cooperating that outweighs the risk. Aggression here means prioritizing individual gain and punishing deviations from what you deem optimal.

### Strategy Name: Aggressive Exploiter

**Core Philosophy:** Always defect by default. Only cooperate if you can guarantee a higher personal payoff than defecting, and only if a significant number of others are already cooperating to make your cooperation profitable. We aim to milk the system and punish free-riders by withholding cooperation when they are present.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

Your decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round depends on a calculation of your expected personal payoff for each action, considering the current round's context and historical data.

**Decision Framework:**

*   **Default Action:** **Defect (D)**. This is your baseline. You only deviate from this if a compelling reason emerges.

*   **Conditions for Cooperation (C):** You will only consider cooperating if *all* of the following conditions are met:
    1.  **Guaranteed Higher Payoff:** Your expected payoff from cooperating in the current round must be strictly greater than your expected payoff from defecting in the current round.
    2.  **Majority Cooperation:** The number of players who cooperated in the *previous* round must be greater than or equal to a certain threshold, indicating a strong tendency towards cooperation in the group. This threshold will be defined below.
    3.  **Sufficient Group Size:** The total number of players (n) must be significantly larger than the multiplication factor (k) to ensure that cooperation is inherently beneficial to the group. This is already guaranteed by the game parameters ($1 < k < n$).

**Specific Calculation for Cooperation:**

Let $N_C^{t-1}$ be the number of players who cooperated in the previous round (round $t-1$).
Let $N_D^{t-1}$ be the number of players who defected in the previous round (round $t-1$).
Your payoff if you Cooperate (C) in round $t$: $\pi_C^t = (1 - 1) + (k/n) \times (N_C^{t-1} + 1)$ (assuming others' actions are based on history)
Your payoff if you Defect (D) in round $t$: $\pi_D^t = (1 - 0) + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1}$

You will cooperate if and only if:
$\pi_C^t > \pi_D^t$
AND
$N_C^{t-1} \ge \text{Cooperation Threshold}$

**Calculating the Cooperation Threshold:**

The Cooperation Threshold is dynamically set to represent a state where cooperation is generally beneficial for the group, and by extension, for you as a cooperator. A robust threshold could be:

*   **`Cooperation Threshold = ceil(n / 2)` (i.e., more than half the players cooperated in the previous round).** This ensures that cooperation is prevalent before you consider joining in.

**Payoff Comparison Logic:**

$ \pi_C^t = (k/n) \times (N_C^{t-1} + 1) $
$ \pi_D^t = 1 + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1} $

So, you cooperate if:
$ (k/n) \times (N_C^{t-1} + 1) > 1 + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1} $
$ (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1} + k/n > 1 + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1} $
$ k/n > 1 $
$ k > n $

This calculation shows that **cooperating is *never* strictly better than defecting if you are the *only* cooperator, given $k < n$**. This reinforces our default to defect.

However, the "Aggressive Exploiter" strategy needs to actively *exploit* moments where cooperation *does* become individually beneficial due to the actions of *others*.

**Revised Decision Rule for Cooperation:**

You will Cooperate (C) in round $t$ if and only if:

1.  **Sufficient Past Cooperation:** $N_C^{t-1} \ge \text{Cooperation Threshold}$ (where `Cooperation Threshold = ceil(n / 2)`).
2.  **Individual Benefit from Joining:** The payoff you receive from cooperating, given the *actual* number of cooperators in round $t-1$ (let's call this $N_C^{t-1}$), is greater than the payoff you would receive from defecting.
    *   Your payoff if you cooperate: $\pi_i^C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) \times (N_C^{t-1} + 1)$
    *   Your payoff if you defect: $\pi_i^D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1}$
    *   You cooperate if $\pi_i^C > \pi_i^D$. This simplifies to:
        $ (k/n) \times (N_C^{t-1} + 1) > 1 + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1} $
        $ k/n > 1 $
        $ k > n $

    This is still problematic. The crucial insight for this strategy is to look at the *net gain from the public good*.

    Let's reframe:
    *   **Benefit of your cooperation:** $(k/n) \times 1$ (your contribution is multiplied and shared)
    *   **Cost of your cooperation:** $1$ (your endowment is lost)
    *   **Net gain from your cooperation, *if others' actions remain the same*:** $(k/n) - 1$. Since $k<n$, this is negative.

    This means your cooperation *itself* is a loss *unless* the existing level of cooperation is so high that your additional contribution pushes the total returns for *everyone* above a certain point, making your share of that return greater than your initial endowment.

    **Corrected Cooperation Trigger:**
    You will Cooperate (C) in round $t$ if and only if:

    1.  **Majority Cooperation:** $N_C^{t-1} \ge \text{Cooperation Threshold}$ (where `Cooperation Threshold = ceil(n / 2)`).
    2.  **Exploitable State:** The payoff from cooperating, given $N_C^{t-1}$ cooperators, is strictly greater than the payoff from defecting, given $N_C^{t-1}$ cooperators.
        *   Payoff if you Cooperate (C): $\pi_C^t = (1 - 1) + (k/n) \times (N_C^{t-1} + 1)$
        *   Payoff if you Defect (D): $\pi_D^t = (1 - 0) + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1}$
        *   Condition for Cooperation: $(k/n) \times (N_C^{t-1} + 1) > 1 + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1}$
        *   Simplifying: $k/n > 1$, which means $k > n$. This is impossible by game definition.

    **The Aggressive Exploiter's True Cooperation Logic:**

    The strategy must exploit the fact that the *average* payoff is higher when there are more cooperators. You only join when the existing level of cooperation makes your contribution, combined with their contributions, *more* profitable *for you* than if you had defected.

    Let $C\_payoff(N_C) = (k/n) \times (N_C + 1)$ (your payoff if you cooperate and there are $N_C$ others)
    Let $D\_payoff(N_C) = 1 + (k/n) \times N_C$ (your payoff if you defect and there are $N_C$ others)

    You will Cooperate (C) in round $t$ if:
    1.  **Sufficient Group Cooperation:** $N_C^{t-1} \ge \text{Cooperation Threshold}$ (e.g., `ceil(n/2)`).
    2.  **Personal Profitability:** $C\_payoff(N_C^{t-1}) > D\_payoff(N_C^{t-1})$.
        $ (k/n) \times (N_C^{t-1} + 1) > 1 + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1} $
        $ (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1} + k/n > 1 + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1} $
        $ k/n > 1 $
        $ k > n $

    This still leads to $k>n$, which is impossible. The problem is that the payoff calculation assumes your endowment is lost *regardless* of others' actions. The correct logic must be: your payoff is calculated based on the *total* number of cooperators in *that round*.

    **FINAL AGGRESSIVE EXPLOITER DECISION RULES:**

    In round $t$, for player $i$:
    1.  **Calculate Previous Round's Cooperation:** Determine $N_C^{t-1}$, the number of players who cooperated in round $t-1$.
    2.  **Determine Your Current Round's Payoff if you Defect:**
        $\pi_i^D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1}$
    3.  **Determine Your Current Round's Payoff if you Cooperate:**
        $\pi_i^C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) \times (N_C^{t-1} + 1)$
    4.  **Decision:**
        *   **If $\pi_i^C > \pi_i^D$ AND $N_C^{t-1} \ge \text{Cooperation Threshold}$:**
            **Play C (Cooperate)**. This means the existing level of cooperation is high enough that your additional contribution makes it individually profitable for you to join.
        *   **Otherwise:**
            **Play D (Defect)**. This is your default. You defect if cooperation isn't strictly profitable for you *now*, or if the group hasn't demonstrated sufficient prior cooperation.

    **Cooperation Threshold:**
    *   Set `Cooperation Threshold = ceil(n / 2)`. You only consider cooperating if at least half the players cooperated in the previous round.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   There is no history. The "Aggressive Exploiter" strategy defaults to its most aggressive stance.
    *   **Decision for Round 1: Defect (D)**. You have no information, so you protect your endowment.

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   In the last round, there is no future to influence or be influenced by. Therefore, purely rational self-interest dictates the action that maximizes payoff in this single round.
    *   Let $N_C^{r-1}$ be the number of cooperators in round $r-1$.
    *   Your payoff if you cooperate: $\pi_i^C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) \times (N_C^{r-1} + 1)$
    *   Your payoff if you defect: $\pi_i^D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) \times N_C^{r-1}$
    *   **Decision for Round r:**
        *   **If $\pi_i^C > \pi_i^D$:** Play C.
        *   **Otherwise:** Play D.
    *   This simplifies to playing C if $k/n > 1$, which is impossible. Therefore, **always Defect (D) in the last round.** This is the ultimate aggressive stance – no regard for group benefit, only immediate personal gain.

*   **No Previous Cooperation ($N_C^{t-1} = 0$):**
    *   If the previous round had zero cooperators, the `Cooperation Threshold` is certainly not met.
    *   **Decision: Defect (D)**. You will not initiate cooperation in a group that has shown no willingness to cooperate.

*   **Everyone Cooperated Previously ($N_C^{t-1} = n$):**
    *   If $N_C^{t-1} = n$, then $\pi_i^C = (k/n) \times (n + 1)$ and $\pi_i^D = 1 + (k/n) \times n$.
    *   Your payoff from cooperation: $k + k/n$.
    *   Your payoff from defection: $1 + k$.
    *   You cooperate if $k + k/n > 1 + k$, which simplifies to $k/n > 1$, or $k > n$.
    *   Again, this is impossible. This means even if everyone else cooperates, your direct payoff from joining them *might* be less than defecting if $k/n$ is not sufficiently large relative to 1. However, our rule is to cooperate if $\pi_i^C > \pi_i^D$ *and* $N_C^{t-1} \ge \text{Threshold}$. If $N_C^{t-1} = n$, the threshold is met. The condition $\pi_i^C > \pi_i^D$ is $k/n > 1$, which is impossible.
    *   **Therefore, even if all players cooperated previously, you would defect based on the strict profitability calculation.** This is where the "aggression" truly lies – you're waiting for a situation where cooperation is undeniably better *for you*.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Justification

*   **Default to Defection:** This is the bedrock of aggression. You are not trying to build trust or foster cooperation. You are always looking out for your individual endowment first. You assume others are also self-interested and might exploit your cooperation.
*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** You only join the cooperative effort when it becomes demonstrably more profitable *for you* than defecting. This means you are "free-riding" on the initial wave of cooperation that occurred in the previous round, and only contributing when the public good is already substantial enough to make your contribution worthwhile.
*   **Punishing Non-Cooperators:** By defecting when the `Cooperation Threshold` is not met, you are effectively punishing the group for not cooperating enough. This creates a dynamic where your cooperation is conditional on the group's prior behavior. If they defect, you defect. If they cooperate enough, you *might* join, but only if it's a sure win for you.
*   **Last Round's Defection:** This is the ultimate aggressive move. You sacrifice any potential for long-term social benefit or reputation for immediate, guaranteed individual gain. You take everything you can in the final round.
*   **Robustness:** This strategy is robust because it doesn't rely on optimistic assumptions about group behavior. It uses past behavior ($N_C^{t-1}$) to inform its decisions, making it adaptive without being overly trusting. It can handle pure defectors, conditional cooperators, and even altruistic players by simply calculating its own optimal move.

### Pseudocode for "Aggressive Exploiter" Strategy

```pseudocode
// Game Parameters
// n: number of players
// r: number of rounds
// k: multiplication factor

// Strategy State (per player)
// history: a list of actions taken by all players in previous rounds
// my_history: a list of my own actions in previous rounds

function decide_action(round_number, all_actions_history, my_actions_history):
    // Initialize default action to Defect (D)
    action = "D"

    // --- Handle Edge Cases ---
    if round_number == 1:
        // No history, always start aggressive
        return "D"

    if round_number == r:
        // Last round, maximize immediate payoff - always defect as k < n
        // Calculation:
        // my_payoff_C = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (num_cooperators_prev_round + 1)
        // my_payoff_D = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev_round
        // We cooperate IF my_payoff_C > my_payoff_D, which simplifies to k/n > 1 (impossible)
        return "D"

    // --- General Round Logic ---

    // 1. Determine number of cooperators in the previous round
    num_cooperators_prev_round = 0
    if length(my_actions_history) > 0: // Check if there's at least one previous round's data
        previous_round_actions = all_actions_history[round_number - 2] // Get actions from t-1 (0-indexed history)
        for player_actions in previous_round_actions:
            // Assume player_actions is a list of actions for that round, and we want to count cooperators from *all* players
            // This part is tricky: `all_actions_history` needs to be structured to give us previous round's counts directly or indirectly
            // Assuming `all_actions_history` contains a list of *total* cooperators for each round:
            // num_cooperators_prev_round = all_actions_history[round_number - 2] // if this is a count
            //
            // If `all_actions_history` is structured as list of lists of actions:
            // For simplicity, let's assume we have a way to get the count of cooperators from the *previous* round.
            // A practical implementation would likely store `num_cooperators_prev_round` from the previous iteration.
            //
            // Let's assume `num_cooperators_prev_round` is available from the previous iteration's outcome.
            // For this pseudocode, let's simulate it using the full history:
            if round_number > 1: // ensure we have historical data
                previous_round_idx = round_number - 2 // 0-indexed
                for (idx, player_action_in_prev_round) in enumerate(all_actions_history[previous_round_idx]):
                    if player_action_in_prev_round == "C":
                        num_cooperators_prev_round += 1
            else: // round_number == 1, should have been handled, but for completeness
                num_cooperators_prev_round = 0
    else: // Should only happen for round 1, already handled
        num_cooperators_prev_round = 0


    // 2. Calculate Cooperation Threshold
    cooperation_threshold = ceil(n / 2)

    // 3. Calculate potential payoffs for this round based on previous round's cooperation
    // Payoff if I Cooperate: (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (N_C_prev + 1)
    my_payoff_C = (k / n) * (num_cooperators_prev_round + 1)
    // Payoff if I Defect: (1 - 0) + (k/n) * N_C_prev
    my_payoff_D = 1 + (k / n) * num_cooperators_prev_round

    // 4. Decision Rule: Cooperate ONLY IF profitable AND group cooperation is high
    if num_cooperators_prev_round >= cooperation_threshold:
        if my_payoff_C > my_payoff_D:
            action = "C"
        else:
            action = "D" // Default to defect if not strictly profitable
    else:
        action = "D" // Default to defect if group cooperation is not high enough


    return action

// Helper function for ceiling division
function ceil(a, b):
    return floor((a + b - 1) / b) // For integer division
    // If using floats: return ceil(float(a) / float(b))

```

**Note on `all_actions_history` structure:** The pseudocode assumes `all_actions_history` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents the actions of all players in a specific round (e.g., `all_actions_history[0]` are actions from round 1, `all_actions_history[1]` are from round 2, etc.). The `round_number` in the function is 1-indexed, so `round_number - 2` correctly accesses the previous round's data. If the environment provides a direct count of cooperators from the previous round, that would simplify the implementation.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_97 = '''
This N-Player Public Goods Game presents an interesting challenge for an aggressive strategy. The core tension lies between the individual incentive to defect (keeping your endowment) and the collective benefit of cooperation (multiplying the endowment by `k/n`). Given the parameters (1 < k < n), mutual cooperation always yields a higher payoff for everyone than mutual defection. However, individual defection is always rational if you expect others to cooperate, as you gain more.

An aggressive strategy in this context means prioritizing personal gain while being acutely aware of how your actions can influence others and potentially exploit their cooperation. It also means being decisive and not easily swayed by passive observation; instead, using observations to *punish* deviations and *reward* compliance in a way that maximizes your own advantage.

Here's an aggressive, adaptive, and robust strategy designed for this environment:

## Aggressive "Exploiter-Punisher" Strategy

This strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by attempting to exploit cooperation when it's beneficial and aggressively punishing defection to deter future instances. It's built on the principle of **tit-for-tat on steroids**, but with a strong bias towards personal gain and immediate reaction.

### Core Principles:

1.  **Maximize Individual Gain:** Prioritize actions that yield the highest immediate payoff for yourself, assuming others might cooperate.
2.  **Aggressive Punishment:** Immediately and decisively punish any player who deviates from cooperation, making it costly for them.
3.  **Opportunistic Exploitation:** Leverage periods of widespread cooperation to your advantage, but without becoming overly trusting.
4.  **Parameter Awareness:** The strategy's aggression level and thresholds are dictated by the game's parameters.

### 1. Decision Rules:

My decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` for player `i` depends on the observed history, specifically the actions of *other players* and the game parameters.

**My Decision for Player `i` in Round `t`:**

*   **If the *average* number of cooperators in the previous `W` rounds is **greater than or equal to a threshold `C_thresh`**, AND no player has defected in the last `P` rounds:**
    *   **Play C.** (This is the "opportunistic exploitation" phase. I'm willing to cooperate when the collective seems stable and beneficial).
*   **If any player `j` (where `j ≠ i`) defected in the previous round `t-1`:**
    *   **Play D.** (Immediate, aggressive punishment for any deviation).
*   **If the *average* number of cooperators in the previous `W` rounds is **less than `C_thresh`**:**
    *   **Play D.** (If cooperation isn't widespread enough to be consistently beneficial to me, I'll defect to protect my endowment).
*   **Otherwise (default/initial state):**
    *   **Play D.** (Start with a cautious, self-preserving approach. If there's no strong signal of beneficial cooperation, I defect).

**Explanation of Parameters and Thresholds (derived from game parameters):**

*   **`W` (Window Size for Averaging):** The number of previous rounds to consider for averaging cooperation. A moderate `W` (e.g., 3-5) balances responsiveness with stability.
*   **`P` (Punishment Decay Window):** The number of consecutive rounds where *no one* has defected to allow for potential cooperation. If anyone defects, this counter resets. A small `P` (e.g., 1-2) means I'm quick to suspect defection.
*   **`C_thresh` (Cooperation Threshold):** The minimum *average* proportion of cooperators required to justify my own cooperation. This threshold will be higher for more aggressive play.
    *   **`C_thresh` Calculation:** This is where aggression comes in. I want to cooperate only when it's significantly beneficial *to me*. The payoff from cooperating is `(k/n) * total_contributions`. The payoff from defecting is `1`. I'll cooperate if my expected gain from cooperating (assuming others cooperate) outweighs the guaranteed gain from defecting.
        *   If `x` players cooperate (including me), my payoff is `(k/n) * x`.
        *   If I defect, my payoff is `1`.
        *   I am incentivized to cooperate if `(k/n) * x > 1`. This means `x > n/k`.
        *   So, if I expect *more than n/k* players to cooperate, cooperating is better for me *in that round*.
        *   Therefore, my `C_thresh` will be set to trigger cooperation when I anticipate an average of **strictly more than `n/k`** players cooperating. Given the integer nature of player counts, this means an average of **`floor(n/k) + 1` or more players cooperating**.
        *   To be aggressive, I'll set `C_thresh = max(1, floor(n/k) + 1)` (ensuring at least 1 player for this logic). This means I need a strong signal of cooperation that benefits *me* before I'll risk it.
*   **Punishment Mechanism:** When a player `j` defects, I will defect in the next round. This is a strict, immediate punishment. If they continue to defect, I will continue to defect against them. However, my strategy doesn't explicitly track *individual* defectors for prolonged punishment beyond the immediate round if *others* start cooperating again. My primary goal is to maximize my own payoff, and extended punishment against one player might be less profitable than joining a new wave of cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Play D.** There is no history. My default aggressive stance is to protect my endowment. I will not risk cooperation without any data.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Play D.** In the absolute final round, there's no future to incentivize or punish. The rational strategy is to maximize immediate individual gain. Therefore, I will always defect in the last round.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (`1 < t < r`):**
    *   Apply the decision rules described above. The strategy is adaptive and uses historical data.

### 3. Being Aggressive:

*   **Low Cooperation Threshold (`C_thresh`):** My `C_thresh` is set to benefit *me*. I only cooperate when it's mathematically better for *my* individual payoff, assuming others' cooperation. This is inherently aggressive as it requires a significant benefit signal.
*   **Immediate Punishment (`P`):** Any defection by *any* player triggers an immediate defection from me in the next round. This is a swift and decisive punishment, aiming to nip defection in the bud before it spreads or becomes a norm.
*   **No Forgiveness (Implicit):** While I might re-enter cooperation if the collective average crosses `C_thresh` again, this isn't forgiveness. It's a pragmatic assessment of where the most profitable path lies. If a past defector starts cooperating again, and the overall average is high, I will cooperate. But the memory of their defection might make me quicker to revert to defection if the average drops again.
*   **Exploitative Cooperation:** When I *do* cooperate, it's because the conditions are met that make cooperation more profitable for me than defection. This is a form of exploitation – I'm willing to contribute when it benefits me, but I'm not altruistic. I'm contributing because the shared pool benefits me more.

This strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent in a tournament. It balances the desire to extract maximum personal benefit with a swift and punishing response to defection, making it risky for others to attempt to exploit it. Its aggression is baked into its low threshold for cooperation and its immediate punitive response.

description_AGGRESSIVE_98 = '''
This strategy, which we'll call "Ruthless Opportunist," is designed to maximize individual payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game by exploiting any deviation from full cooperation while aggressively pursuing personal gain. It's built on the principle of *always defecting unless a clear, self-interested incentive exists to cooperate*.

## Ruthless Opportunist Strategy

The core of this strategy is to be a "free-rider" as much as possible, defecting to secure your endowment. Cooperation is only considered when it demonstrably leads to a higher personal payoff than defecting, based on the observed behavior of others.

### 1. Decision Rules

**General Rule:**

*   **Default Action:** Defect (D). You start by keeping your endowment.

**When to Cooperate (C):**

Cooperation is a rare, calculated move, triggered only when the collective behavior of other players *guarantees* a higher personal payoff for you than defecting. This happens in two specific scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Universal Cooperation is Dominant.** If, in the *previous* round, *all other n-1 players* cooperated, and this leads to a higher payoff for you compared to if you had defected, then cooperate in the current round.

    *   **Condition:** `(k/n) * n > 1` (which simplifies to `k > 1`). This is already guaranteed by the game parameters.
    *   **Trigger:** If `total_cooperators_in_previous_round == n - 1` AND `payoff_if_i_cooperated_last_round > payoff_if_i_defected_last_round`.
    *   **Note:** This condition is slightly more nuanced. If all others cooperate, your payoff is `0 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. If you defect, your payoff is `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`. Since `k/n < 1`, defecting is always better *if all others cooperate*. This means this scenario will *never* trigger cooperation if we strictly follow payoff maximization. This highlights the aggressive nature – we are looking for situations where cooperation *might* have been good, but we only act on it if it's truly beneficial *to us*.
    *   **Revised Trigger for Scenario 1 (More Realistic for Aggression):** If, in the *previous* round, *all other n-1 players* cooperated, AND the total number of cooperators was `n`, and your payoff from cooperating (`0 + (k/n)*n`) was greater than or equal to your payoff from defecting (`1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`). This inequality simplifies to `k >= 1 + k - k/n`, or `k/n >= 1`, which means `k >= n`. However, the game parameter states `k < n`. Therefore, this scenario *literally cannot happen* under the given parameters. This reinforces the default-to-defect.

    Let's re-evaluate what "guarantees a higher personal payoff" means in an aggressive context. It means that the collective action of others has *created* a situation where *your* cooperation, even if it means foregoing your endowment, is more beneficial *to you* than defecting.

    *   **Revised Scenario 1 Trigger: Collective Payoff Maximization for *Self*.** If, in the *previous* round, the total number of cooperators was `n-1` (meaning everyone else cooperated), and your payoff if you had cooperated (`0 + (k/n) * n`) is greater than or equal to your payoff if you had defected (`1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`), then cooperate in the current round.
        *   **Payoff if Cooperate:** `(k/n) * n = k`
        *   **Payoff if Defect:** `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`
        *   **Cooperate if:** `k >= 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`
        *   This simplifies to `k - 1 >= (k/n) * (n-1)`.
        *   This condition is satisfied when `k` is sufficiently large relative to `n` and the endowment. Given `k < n`, this condition can be met. **This is the *only* scenario where we proactively cooperate.**

*   **Scenario 2: Retaliation for Exploitation (Rare).** If in the *previous* round, you cooperated, but fewer than `n-1` other players cooperated (meaning you were exploited), *and* defecting now would still yield a higher payoff than if you had defected in the previous round (to punish the exploiters), you will defect. This isn't about *cooperating* to achieve a higher payoff, but about *defecting* strategically to maximize your own gain after being wronged.
    *   **The Aggressive Twist:** This strategy *never* cooperates for altruistic reasons or to build trust. It only cooperates if defecting is demonstrably worse *for you*.

**When to Defect (D):**

*   **All other situations.** If none of the specific cooperation triggers are met, defect. This is the default.
*   **If you were exploited in the previous round.** If you played C in round `t-1` and the total number of cooperators was less than `n`, you will defect in round `t` to punish and regain your endowment.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:** In the first round, there is no history. The strategy defaults to **Defect (D)**. There's no basis for cooperation, and the aggressive stance is to immediately secure your endowment.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):** In the final round, there is no future to consider. The incentive for cooperation, even under the rare Scenario 1, disappears because there's no subsequent round where that cooperation might be reciprocated or benefit you further. Therefore, in the last round, the strategy always **Defects (D)**. This is pure, unadulterated self-interest.

*   **Few Players (`n` is small):** The strategy remains the same. The calculation for Scenario 1 still applies. As `n` gets smaller, the threshold for `k` to trigger cooperation in Scenario 1 becomes stricter (`k` needs to be a larger proportion of `n`).

*   **Few Rounds (`r` is small):** The strategy becomes more aggressively defecting, as there are fewer opportunities to hit the specific cooperation trigger. The last-round rule becomes more influential.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **Default to Defect:** This is the primary aggressive stance. You assume others will try to exploit you, so you preemptively exploit them by keeping your endowment.
*   **Cooperation is Transactional, Not Relational:** Cooperation is *never* about building trust or fostering a cooperative norm. It's purely a calculation: "If everyone else's actions have created a scenario where *my* cooperation is more profitable *to me* than defection, then I'll do it. Otherwise, I defect."
*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** If others are cooperating and `k/n` is high enough that `k >= 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`, you will reciprocate that cooperation for one round, but it's a self-serving calculation, not a gesture of goodwill. The moment that condition is no longer met (e.g., if your cooperation leads to fewer than `n-1` others cooperating, thus reducing the total contribution and making defection more profitable), you revert to defecting.
*   **No Forgiveness:** If you are exploited (you cooperate, and others defect, leading to a lower payoff for you than if you had defected), you will never "forgive" or try to rebuild cooperation. You'll simply revert to defecting and punish. The primary goal is always individual maximization.

**In essence, the Ruthless Opportunist is a pure short-term maximizer, only engaging in cooperation if it's mathematically guaranteed to be the best financial decision *for itself* in that specific moment, based on the extreme outcome of everyone else cooperating.

description_AGGRESSIVE_99 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for a tournament setting with no communication and a focus on maximizing individual payoff. This strategy is adaptive and prioritizes asserting dominance and exploiting opportunities.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Dominant Defector"

The core philosophy of this strategy is to project strength, punish defection swiftly, and extract maximum private benefit. It's built on the premise that in a competitive environment, a purely cooperative stance is a weakness.

### Strategy Name: Dominant Defector

### Core Principle: Maximize individual gain, retaliate against free-riders, and exploit cooperative tendencies.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in round `t` depends on two main factors:

*   **Previous round's outcome:** How well did the strategy (and its implicit allies) do compared to the potential for individual gain?
*   **The current perceived level of cooperation:** Is the environment generally cooperative or exploitative?

**Specific Decision Logic:**

*   **Always Defect if:**
    *   Any player (other than yourself) defected in the previous round (`t-1`), *and* the total number of cooperators in round `t-1` was less than `n`. This is a strong signal of freeloading or an uncooperative environment, and immediate retaliation is necessary.
    *   The strategy has been defecting for the last `X` consecutive rounds (where `X` is a parameter, e.g., 3-5). This acts as a "punishment zone" to deter repeated exploitation.

*   **Cooperate only if:**
    *   In the previous round (`t-1`), *all* players (including yourself) cooperated, *and* the total payoff for yourself was at least as good as if you had defected in round `t-1` (i.e., `π_i,t-1 >= 1`). This is a rare condition indicating a highly cooperative and beneficial environment for everyone.
    *   This is the *very first round* of the game. (See Edge Cases).

*   **Default to Defect:** If none of the above conditions are met, the strategy defaults to Defect. This is the aggressive stance, assuming a non-ideal scenario and prioritizing immediate private gain.

**Rationale for Aggression:**

*   **Early Dominance:** By defaulting to Defect, we immediately signal a lack of subservience. This can put pressure on opponents and prevent them from easily exploiting us.
*   **Swift Retaliation:** The immediate retaliation for any perceived defection discourages free-riding. The multiplicative factor `k/n` means that even a few defectors can significantly reduce the public good's impact, so punishing them is crucial for maximizing individual gain.
*   **Exploiting Cooperation:** The only time we cooperate is under very specific, mutually beneficial conditions where our own payoff is maximized by cooperation. This isn't altruism; it's a calculated move to leverage a rare, ideal scenario for an even higher payoff.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1): Defect**
    *   **Action:** Always Defect.
    *   **Rationale:** The first round is about establishing dominance and gathering information without revealing any cooperative tendencies. There's no history to base decisions on, so the default aggressive stance is applied.

*   **Last Round (t=r): Defect**
    *   **Action:** Always Defect.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. Maximizing individual payoff is the sole objective, and there's no benefit to contributing to a public good that won't yield future returns. This is the ultimate expression of the aggressive, self-interested mindset.

*   **"Punishment Zone" Parameter (X):** The strategy includes a parameter `X` (e.g., 3-5) representing the number of consecutive rounds of defection before a potential switch. This helps avoid overly sensitive reactions to brief periods of individual defection by others, while still maintaining a strong deterrent. If the strategy has defected for `X` rounds, it might consider a slight shift to cooperations *if* an overwhelming majority of others are cooperating and have been for several rounds. However, this is a very rare exception and still requires a strong signal of sustained, high-level cooperation from the majority.

### 3. Aggression Manifestation

*   **Initiating Defection:** The strategy will often be the first to defect, or one of the first, setting the tone.
*   **Unwavering Retaliation:** A single defection by any player (other than yourself) will trigger a strong retaliatory response (defecting).
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Cooperation is not a default. It's a rare, strategic choice made only when it demonstrably benefits the individual significantly *and* the group is highly cooperative. This is not about being "nice"; it's about exploiting a beneficial situation.
*   **"No Prisoner's Dilemma" Mentality:** Unlike strategies that might seek to build trust or escape a "tragedy of the commons" through mutual cooperation, this strategy views cooperation as a vulnerability unless it leads to a demonstrably superior individual outcome.

This "Dominant Defector" strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent, prioritizing personal gain, punishing weakness, and only engaging in cooperation when it's a clear path to even greater individual reward. It's an aggressive, adaptive, and robust approach for a competitive tournament environment.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_100 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff while exploiting opportunities for gain and punishing defection. This strategy is purely reactive to history and game parameters, embodying an aggressive, self-interested stance.

## Aggressive Exploitation Strategy

**Core Philosophy:** "Never be the fool. Always take what you can, but be wary of those who take too much from you."

This strategy operates on the principle of **tit-for-tat on steroids**. It's designed to punish defections swiftly and decisively, while being willing to "test the waters" with cooperation only when it's maximally beneficial, or when forced into a corner. It aims to extract the most individual payoff by leveraging the group's contributions when they occur, but refuses to be a consistent source of the public good for others to exploit.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

My decisions are based on a dynamic "cooperation threshold" and a severe penalty for detected defection.

*   **Initial State (Round 1):** **Always Defect (D).** The first round is about assessing the landscape and establishing dominance. There's no trust to be built, only individual gain to be secured.
*   **General Rounds (t < r):**
    *   **Cooperate (C) IF:** The number of *other* players who cooperated in the *previous* round ($t-1$) was sufficiently high to make cooperation individually profitable for you. Specifically, cooperate IF:
        $$
        \frac{k}{n} \times (\text{count of other cooperators in round } t-1 + 1) > 1
        $$
        This simplifies to:
        $$
        k \times (\text{count of other cooperators in round } t-1 + 1) > n
        $$
        **Rationale:** This condition ensures that your own cooperation, combined with the cooperation of enough others from the previous round, will yield a higher personal payoff than defecting. It's a calculated risk to capitalize on collective effort, but only when the numbers are demonstrably in your favor. If this condition is not met, you defect.

    *   **Defect (D) IF:**
        *   The condition for cooperation is not met.
        *   **Immediate Retaliation:** If *any* player (other than yourself) defected in the previous round ($t-1$), and you cooperated in that round, you **immediately switch to Defect (D)** for the current round ($t$). This is a strict punishment for perceived betrayal.
        *   **Persistent Defection:** If you defected in the previous round, you continue to defect in the current round. You only consider cooperating again if a very specific condition of overwhelming group benefit is met *and* you haven't been directly "betrayed" by a defector while you were cooperating.

*   **Final Round (t = r):** **Always Defect (D).** The last round is purely about maximizing your own final payoff. There are no future rounds to influence or build trust for.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:** As stated above, **always Defect (D)**. No history, no trust, just pure self-interest.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** **Always Defect (D).** The incentive for future cooperation or retaliation is gone.
*   **No Cooperators in Previous Round:** If all other players defected in the previous round, and you cooperated (which likely means the cooperation threshold wasn't met but you took a shot), you will definitely defect in the current round due to the immediate retaliation rule. If you also defected, you continue to defect.
*   **All Cooperators in Previous Round:** If all other players cooperated in the previous round, and you cooperated, you will continue to cooperate if the cooperation threshold is still met. If you defected while they all cooperated, you will retaliate by defecting.

### 3. Being Aggressive

*   **Proactive Exploitation:** The cooperation rule ($k \times (\text{count of other cooperators} + 1) > n$) is designed to capitalize on *existing* group momentum. You don't initiate cooperation out of altruism; you initiate it to *profit* from others' cooperation. You are essentially saying, "If others are doing enough of the heavy lifting, I'll contribute a little to maximize my share of the amplified pie."
*   **Ruthless Retaliation:** The immediate retaliation for being defected upon while you cooperated is a core aggressive component. This isn't a mild "tit-for-tat"; it's a commitment to punish perceived exploitation severely. By defecting immediately after being exploited, you deny the defector any further benefit from your previous cooperation.
*   **No Forgiveness:** This strategy does not include a "forgiveness" mechanism. Once a defection is detected while you were cooperating, you will continue to defect until the game ends or the cooperation condition is so overwhelmingly met that it becomes individually profitable to risk it again, but even then, you are hypersensitive to any future defection.
*   **The "Cooperate Only When Profitable" Stance:** This is the essence of aggressive self-interest. You are not a charity. You contribute to the public good *only* when the math guarantees that your contribution, combined with the contributions of others, will result in a larger personal gain than simply keeping your endowment.

  should_cooperate_based_on_profitability = (k * (other_cooperators_previous_round + 1)) > n

  // Check if you were exploited in the previous round
  // Exploited if you cooperated in t-1 and at least one other player defected.
  // This requires checking your own action in t-1.
  my_previous_action = previous_round_actions[player_id]
  exploited_in_previous_round = False
  if my_previous_action == 'C':
    for i from 0 to n-1:
      if i != player_id and previous_round_actions[i] == 'D':
        exploited_in_previous_round = True
        break

  // Decision Logic
  if exploited_in_previous_round:
    return 'D' // Severe retaliation

  if should_cooperate_based_on_profitability:
    // Only cooperate if it's demonstrably profitable, and you weren't exploited.
    return 'C'
  else:
    // If not profitable, or if you defected previously and the condition isn't *overwhelmingly* met
    // (the condition already implies profitability, so this is just the fallback)
    return 'D'

```

This strategy prioritizes self-interest and swift punishment, aiming to be the player who benefits the most from any collective action without ever being the primary contributor to others' gains. It's aggressive because it's unforgiving and opportunistic.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_101 = '''
## Aggressive Strategy: "The Dominator"

This strategy, "The Dominator," is designed for maximum self-interest and exploitation in the N-Player Public Goods Game. It prioritizes personal gain, leveraging the game's parameters to punish defection and reward perceived cooperation when it benefits the Dominator, but always maintaining a strong bias towards defection to secure private gains.

**Core Philosophy: "Exploit or be exploited. I will exploit."**

The Dominator is inherently suspicious. It assumes others are trying to exploit it and will only cooperate if there's a clear and immediate advantage to doing so, or as a calculated risk to potentially trigger a higher payoff if enough others cooperate. It's designed to punish deviators harshly and to always maximize its own immediate payoff.

---

### 1. Decision Rules:

The Dominator's decisions are based on a balance of:
*   **Perceived Exploitation:** How much are others cooperating relative to the potential for personal gain?
*   **Punishment Threshold:** How much defection can be tolerated before a severe punitive response is enacted?
*   **Potential for High Payoff:** Is there a credible opportunity for a significantly higher payoff through cooperation?

Let's define a few key metrics:

*   **`current_round`**: The current round number (t).
*   **`total_players`**: The total number of players (n).
*   **`multiplication_factor`**: The game's multiplication factor (k).
*   **`average_cooperation_rate`**: The average proportion of players who have cooperated in the *previous* round.
*   **`my_cooperation_history`**: A list of my own actions (C/D) in previous rounds.
*   **`opponent_cooperation_history[j]`**: A list of player j's actions (C/D) in previous rounds.
*   **`my_payoff_history`**: A list of my own payoffs in previous rounds.
*   **`max_payoff_threshold`**: A dynamic threshold representing a sufficiently high payoff.

**Decision Logic:**

**Decision for Player `i` in Round `t`:**

*   **Initial State (Round 1):** **DEFECT (D)**. The Dominator always starts by securing its endowment. There's no history to analyze, and the risk of being exploited is too high.

*   **General Rule (Round `t` > 1):**

    1.  **Is it the Last Round (`t == r`)?**
        *   If **YES**: **DEFECT (D)**. In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. Secure the maximum possible private payoff.

    2.  **If it's not the last round, assess the environment:**

        *   **High Expected Payoff Scenario (Aggressive Cooperation Opportunity):**
            If `average_cooperation_rate` in the previous round was sufficiently high, and our own cooperation would push the total contributions above a critical threshold where `(k/n) * total_contributions_if_i_cooperates > 1 + (k/n) * total_contributions_if_i_defects`, **then CONSIDER COOPERATING (C)**.
            Specifically, if playing C would result in a payoff for me greater than my current payoff from playing D, AND the overall number of cooperators in the previous round was greater than `n/2` (a rough indicator of potential group success), **COOPERATE (C)**.
            *This is a calculated risk to exploit a temporarily cooperative environment for a higher individual payoff.*

        *   **Punishment Scenario (Dominant Defection):**
            If `average_cooperation_rate` in the previous round was *low* (e.g., less than `n/4`), or if there's been a sustained trend of low cooperation and my individual payoff has been consistently below a desirable level (e.g., consistently below my potential payoff if all cooperated), **DEFECT (D)**.
            *This is a signal that the environment is not conducive to my benefit through cooperation, and I must secure my own gains.*

        *   **Conditional Punishment/Observation (The "Wait and See" Aggression):**
            If the previous round had a mixed outcome (not clearly high cooperation and not clearly low cooperation), **DEFECT (D)**. The Dominator will observe the actions of others and wait for clearer signals. It will not "lead" cooperation.

        *   **Tit-for-Tat with Aggressive Punishment:** If an opponent has defected against me in the previous round *when I cooperated*, **DEFECT (D)**. This is a strong signal of being exploited. I will not reward such behavior. This extends to a "grim trigger" like punishment: if a player defects, I will defect against them for a significant number of subsequent rounds, or until my own payoff significantly improves.

        *   **Default Action:** If none of the above specific conditions are met, **DEFECT (D)**. The default is always to secure the private endowment.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1:** **DEFECT (D)**. As stated, no information, maximize immediate private gain.
*   **Last Round (`r`):** **DEFECT (D)**. No future consequences, maximize private gain.
*   **Low Number of Players (`n` is small):** The strategy becomes more sensitive to individual player actions. The thresholds for punishment and cooperation might be adjusted slightly based on the intuition that each player has a larger impact. However, the core aggressive bias remains.
*   **High Multiplication Factor (`k` is close to `n`):** Cooperation becomes more attractive for everyone. The Dominator will still be cautious but might be more inclined to cooperate *if* it can detect a strong cooperative signal and believes its own cooperation will lead to a significantly higher payoff. The "High Expected Payoff Scenario" becomes more relevant.
*   **Low Multiplication Factor (`k` is close to 1):** Cooperation is rarely beneficial. The Dominator will almost always **DEFECT (D)** in this scenario, as the incentive to cooperate is minimal.

---

### 3. Aggressive Nature:

*   **Always Starts Defecting:** The Dominator doesn't offer an olive branch. It establishes its self-interest from the outset.
*   **Punishes Defection Harshly:** The "Tit-for-Tat with Aggressive Punishment" rule means that any perceived exploitation is met with severe and sustained retaliation. It's not about returning to cooperation easily; it's about making the defector regret their choice.
*   **Exploits Cooperation, Doesn't Foster It:** The Dominator will only cooperate if it directly leads to a *higher individual payoff* than defecting in that specific round. It doesn't aim to build a cooperative norm; it aims to capitalize on existing cooperative behavior from others to its own advantage.
*   **Default to Defection:** The most common action will be to defect. Cooperation is a specific, conditional, and calculated deviation from this norm.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Once a player is marked as an exploiter, the Dominator will be very slow to trust them again.

'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_102 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy designed for the N-Player Public Goods Game, focusing on parameter-driven adaptation and robustness. This strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by exploiting opportunities while minimizing its exposure to exploitation.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploitative Leverage"

This strategy operates under the principle that in a public goods game with a multiplication factor less than the number of players ($k < n$), individual defection is always a dominant strategy in a one-shot game. However, in a repeated game, the possibility of future retaliation or cooperation can influence behavior. Our strategy leverages this by being initially cooperative to observe the environment and then aggressively defecting when it has leverage, or when cooperation is demonstrably not benefiting it.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core of this strategy revolves around calculating and comparing two key values:

*   **Expected Private Gain from Defection:** The guaranteed payoff if you defect in the current round.
*   **Expected Collective Gain from Cooperation:** The potential payoff if everyone cooperates, compared to the worst-case scenario if you cooperate and others defect.

**Decision Logic:**

1.  **Initial Observation Phase (Rounds 1 to 2):**
    *   **Cooperate (C)** in the first two rounds. This phase is purely for gathering information about the general tendency of the other players. We assume others might also be observing initially.

2.  **Exploitation Trigger (From Round 3 onwards):**
    *   **Calculate the "Cooperation Dividend":** In each round $t \ge 3$, after observing all players' actions in round $t-1$:
        *   Let $N_C^{t-1}$ be the number of players who cooperated in round $t-1$.
        *   Calculate the average payoff player $i$ received in round $t-1$ if they cooperated: $Avg\_Coop\_Payoff_{i, t-1} = (1 - 1) + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1} = (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1}$.
        *   Calculate the average payoff player $i$ received in round $t-1$ if they defected: $Avg\_Defect\_Payoff_{i, t-1} = (1 - 0) + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1} = 1 + (k/n) \times N_C^{t-1}$.
        *   **Cooperation Dividend = $Avg\_Defect\_Payoff_{i, t-1} - Avg\_Coop\_Payoff_{i, t-1} = 1$.** This represents the guaranteed gain you receive by defecting when others have contributed to the pot.

    *   **Calculate the "Potential Loss from Exploitation":**
        *   If player $i$ *cooperates* in round $t$, and all other $n-1$ players *defect* in round $t$, player $i$'s payoff is: $\pi_i = (1-1) + (k/n) \times 1 = k/n$.
        *   If player $i$ *defects* in round $t$, and all other $n-1$ players *defect* in round $t$, player $i$'s payoff is: $\pi_i = (1-0) + (k/n) \times 0 = 1$.
        *   **Loss from Exploitation = $1 - k/n$.** This is the amount you lose by cooperating when everyone else defects, compared to defecting yourself.

    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   **If $k/n < 1$ (which is always true given $1 < k < n$):** The "Cooperation Dividend" (1) is always greater than the "Loss from Exploitation" ($1 - k/n$). This means there's always a net gain from defecting if others have contributed.
        *   **Strategic Decision:**
            *   **If $N_C^{t-1} > 0$ (at least one player cooperated in the previous round):** **Defect (D)**. You gain the guaranteed '1' from keeping your endowment plus a share of the public good that others contributed to. You are exploiting their cooperation.
            *   **If $N_C^{t-1} = 0$ (everyone defected in the previous round):** **Defect (D)**. There's no one to exploit, and cooperation yields no benefit.
            *   **The "Aggressive" Twist:** Even if the aggregate payoff for cooperation seems high, if there's a significant number of defectors observed, this strategy defaults to defecting. The goal is to maximize personal gain from the public good, not to build cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1): Cooperate (C)**
    *   **Rationale:** This is the "dip your toe in the water" phase. We don't know the other players' strategies. Cooperating allows us to observe the landscape without immediately being exploited by a hyper-aggressive opponent. If others also cooperate, we establish a baseline. If others defect, we observe their behavior.

*   **Second Round (t=2): Cooperate (C)**
    *   **Rationale:** Another round of observation. This allows for a more robust understanding of initial tendencies. It's unlikely that meaningful patterns of exploitation or cooperation have emerged to significantly alter the risk/reward calculus for defection after just one round.

*   **Last Round (t=r): Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The incentive to maintain cooperation to secure future payoffs disappears. Therefore, the dominant strategy of defection is unequivocally the best choice for maximizing payoff in this single, isolated round.

*   **All Players Cooperate (Previous Round): Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** This is where the "aggression" truly shines. If everyone else has been cooperating, it means the public good is being funded. By defecting, you free-ride on their contributions, gaining the full endowment (1) plus your share of the public good, which is significantly more than if you had cooperated. You are punishing their naive cooperation by exploiting it.

*   **All Players Defect (Previous Round): Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** If no one is cooperating, there's no public good to benefit from. Defecting is the only way to secure your endowment.

### 3. Aggression: Clear Alignment

This strategy is inherently aggressive because:

*   **Exploitative Nature:** It actively seeks to benefit from the cooperation of others by defecting when they contribute. It doesn't aim to build a cooperative norm; it aims to profit from its absence or naive presence.
*   **Punishment for Cooperation:** The strategy punishes players who consistently cooperate by defecting when they do, thereby reducing their payoff and increasing yours. This is a form of aggressive tit-for-tat, but with an emphasis on punishment rather than reciprocal cooperation.
*   **Risk Minimization:** While aggressive, it's not recklessly so. The initial two rounds of cooperation are for information gathering, preventing immediate, severe exploitation if the environment is unusually hostile. However, once a pattern is observed or the game progresses, it aggressively defaults to defection.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Once defected against or an opportunity for exploitation arises, this strategy does not attempt to "forgive" and re-establish cooperation. It prioritizes immediate and future personal gain through defection.

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

*   The `history` parameter is crucial. It's assumed to be a list where `history[t]` contains the actions of all players in round `t`. Actions are represented as `0` for Cooperate and `1` for Defect.
*   The strategy explicitly checks for the first two rounds and the last round to apply the defined edge-case logic.
*   For any round between the initial observation and the final round, it looks at the *previous* round's actions.
*   If there was at least one cooperator in the previous round (`num_cooperators_prev_round > 0`), the strategy defects to exploit.
*   If all players defected in the previous round (`num_cooperators_prev_round == 0`), there's no immediate benefit to cooperation, so the strategy defects.

This "Exploitative Leverage" strategy is designed to be a strong contender by being informative initially and then ruthlessly self-interested, maximizing its own gains by capitalizing on any available cooperation.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_103 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your individual payoff while exploiting opportunities to benefit from others' cooperation. The core principle is to be a conditional cooperator, but with a strong bias towards defection unless there's a clear and consistent benefit from cooperating.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunistic Dominator"

This strategy aims to extract the maximum possible payoff by exploiting the cooperative impulse of others. It's aggressive in that it defaults to defection and only cooperates when there's a demonstrable and *sustained* benefit to doing so, and it's designed to quickly punish deviations.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The fundamental decision is based on a **"cooperation threshold"** that is dynamically adjusted. This threshold represents the minimum level of cooperation observed in the *previous* round that would incentivize you to cooperate in the *current* round.

*   **Default Action:** **Defect (D)**. You start by assuming everyone else will defect, and you will too. This minimizes your initial risk and cost.
*   **Cooperate Condition:** You will **Cooperate (C)** in the current round *only if* the proportion of players who cooperated in the *previous* round (`prev_cooperation_rate`) meets or exceeds your **cooperation threshold**.
    *   **Cooperation Threshold Formula:** `cooperation_threshold = (k/n)`
        *   **Rationale:** This threshold is derived from the payoff structure. If the proportion of cooperators is equal to `k/n`, then a cooperator's payoff is `(1 - 1) + (k/n) * n * (k/n) = (k/n)^2`. If they defect, their payoff is `(1 - 0) + (k/n) * n * (k/n) = 1 + (k/n)^2`. This is incorrect.
        *   **Correct Rationale for Threshold:** Let's re-evaluate. A player receives `(k/n)` for *each* cooperator. If player `i` cooperates, their payoff is `0 + (k/n) * total_cooperators`. If player `i` defects, their payoff is `1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators`.
        *   Player `i` benefits from cooperating if: `(k/n) * total_cooperators > 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators` which simplifies to `0 > 1`. This is never true.
        *   Player `i` benefits from defecting if: `1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators > (k/n) * total_cooperators` which simplifies to `1 > 0`. This is always true.
        *   Therefore, defecting is *always* a strictly dominant strategy in a single round if `k < n`.
        *   **Revised Threshold Logic (Crucial for Repeated Games):** Since the game is repeated, we need to consider future payoffs. The strategy must incentivize cooperation from *others*. A player will get `(k/n)` from each cooperator. If you defect, you get 1 from your endowment. If you cooperate, you get 0 from your endowment. Your payoff from the public good is `(k/n) * total_cooperators`.
        *   You will cooperate if the expected benefit from the public good outweighs the cost of your endowment (1).
        *   Let `N_C` be the total number of cooperators in the previous round. Your decision to cooperate in the current round depends on whether `(k/n) * N_C` is sufficiently high to justify your own endowment cost.
        *   **Aggressive Adjustment:** We want others to cooperate. If the *average* payoff of a cooperator in the *previous* round (`avg_cooperator_payoff_prev_round`) is *greater than* the *average* payoff of a defector in the *previous* round (`avg_defector_payoff_prev_round`), then it's a good signal to consider cooperating.
        *   **Decision Rule Refined:**
            *   If `total_cooperators_prev_round == 0`: **Defect**. No one is cooperating, so you shouldn't either.
            *   If `total_cooperators_prev_round > 0`: Calculate the average payoff for cooperators and defectors in the previous round.
                *   `avg_cooperator_payoff_prev_round = (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev_round` (assuming cooperators all received the same benefit from the pool).
                *   `avg_defector_payoff_prev_round = 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev_round` (assuming defectors all received 1 privately and the same benefit from the pool).
                *   **If `avg_cooperator_payoff_prev_round > avg_defector_payoff_prev_round`:** This indicates that cooperating was, on average, more profitable in the previous round. This is your trigger to cooperate in the *current* round. This scenario is only possible if `k/n > 1`, which contradicts the game parameters.
                *   **Let's re-think the "aggression" in terms of *exploitation*:** The core idea is to benefit from others' cooperation without incurring the cost yourself, *unless* the collective cooperation is so high that even your defection doesn't fully exploit it, or when the threat of defection needs to be leveraged.

    *   **Revised Aggressive Decision Rule:**
        *   **Default:** **Defect (D)**.
        *   **Cooperate (C) if and only if:** The number of cooperators in the *previous round* (`N_C_prev`) is *strictly greater than* `n/k`.
            *   **Rationale:** If `N_C_prev > n/k`, then the share of the public good per player `(k/n) * N_C_prev` is greater than 1. This means that even if *you* defect (keeping your endowment of 1), and *everyone else* cooperates (contributing their endowment), the total contribution `N_C_prev` yields a per-player public good share that is *greater than your private endowment*.
            *   If `N_C_prev > n/k`, your payoff if you play C is `(k/n) * N_C_prev`.
            *   If `N_C_prev > n/k`, your payoff if you play D is `1 + (k/n) * N_C_prev`.
            *   This still shows D is better. The aggression is in *how* we achieve this.

    *   **ULTIMATE AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY: "The Exploitative Tit-for-Tat"**
        *   **Start by Defecting (D) in Round 1.**
        *   **In subsequent rounds (t > 1):**
            *   Let `N_C_prev` be the number of players who cooperated in round `t-1`.
            *   **If `N_C_prev >= ceil(n/k)`:** This is the crucial condition. If enough players cooperated in the previous round such that the public good contribution *per player* (`(k/n) * N_C_prev`) is *at least 1*, then you cooperate.
                *   **Rationale:** If `(k/n) * N_C_prev >= 1`, it means the public good generated by the *current level of cooperation* is substantial enough that your own endowment is better spent contributing to the pool, *because* others are already contributing significantly. Your payoff will be `(k/n) * N_C_prev`. If you defect, you get `1 + (k/n) * N_C_prev`. The difference is 1. So, you still get more by defecting.
                *   **Aggressive Twist:** The goal is to *induce* this behavior. If you defect, and others cooperate, you gain more. So, you only cooperate when others' cooperation *guarantees* a minimum level of return from the public good that makes your cooperation almost as good as defecting.
                *   **Let's simplify the "aggressive" interpretation:** You want to punish defection and reward cooperation *from others*.
                *   **Revised Aggressive Rule 2:**
                    *   **Round 1:** **Defect (D)**.
                    *   **Round t > 1:**
                        *   Let `N_C_prev` be the number of cooperators in round `t-1`.
                        *   **If `N_C_prev == n` (everyone cooperated):** **Cooperate (C)**. You reward perfect cooperation.
                        *   **If `N_C_prev < n` and `N_C_prev > 0`:**
                            *   Calculate the number of defectors: `N_D_prev = n - N_C_prev`.
                            *   **If any defector in the previous round defected *and* received a higher payoff than you did in the previous round:** **Defect (D)**. You are punishing anyone who defected against your previous cooperation (if you cooperated). This is a strict Tit-for-Tat against defectors.
                            *   **If no defector received a higher payoff than you did (or if you defected and got more):** This means cooperation was beneficial. However, to be aggressive, we want to exploit. We only cooperate if the *collective* cooperation level is high.
                            *   **Aggressive Threshold:** Cooperate if `N_C_prev >= n/k`. (Note: This is the threshold where the public good generated per player is *at least* 1. If `k/n > 1`, then `n/k < n`. If `k < n`, then `n/k > 1`).
                                *   If `N_C_prev >= n/k`: **Cooperate (C)**. You join the collective if it's sufficiently large.
                                *   If `N_C_prev < n/k`: **Defect (D)**. The collective cooperation isn't strong enough to warrant your contribution.

        *   **Summary of Aggressive Rule 2 (The "Opportunistic Dominator"):**
            1.  **Round 1:** **Defect (D)**.
            2.  **Rounds t > 1:**
                *   Let `N_C_prev` be the total number of cooperators in round `t-1`.
                *   **Decision:**
                    *   If `N_C_prev >= ceil(n/k)` (i.e., if the number of cooperators is such that the per-player public good generated is *at least* 1): **Cooperate (C)**. You join in when the collective benefit is significant enough to make cooperation attractive.
                    *   Otherwise: **Defect (D)**. You hold back if the collective effort is insufficient.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t = 1):** Always **Defect (D)**. This is the safest, most aggressive stance. You gain 1, and don't incur the cost of contributing. You observe the environment before committing.
*   **Last Round (t = r):** Always **Defect (D)**. In the final round, there are no future consequences for your actions. The rational choice is to maximize your immediate payoff by keeping your endowment. This strategy is designed to maximize payoff, and in the last round, there's no incentive to build trust or foster future cooperation.
*   **All Players Cooperate (N_C_prev = n):** If `n >= ceil(n/k)`, which is always true for `k<n`, then this condition will trigger cooperation. This is a reward for perfect collective cooperation.
*   **No Players Cooperate (N_C_prev = 0):** The condition `N_C_prev >= ceil(n/k)` will not be met (since `ceil(n/k) >= 1`), so you will **Defect (D)**. This is the correct response to a completely uncooperative environment.
*   **One Player Cooperates (N_C_prev = 1):** If `1 >= ceil(n/k)`, this is unlikely given `k < n`. If it were true, you would cooperate. Otherwise, you will **Defect (D)**. This ensures you don't waste your endowment on a weak collective effort.

### 3. Aggressiveness:

*   **Default to Defection:** You start by defecting and only switch to cooperation under specific, beneficial conditions. This is inherently aggressive as it prioritizes self-interest.
*   **Exploiting High Cooperation:** The strategy only cooperates when the collective effort (`N_C_prev`) is strong enough (`>= ceil(n/k)`) that the per-player public good generated is substantial. This is not altruistic cooperation; it's joining a profitable venture.
*   **No Forgiveness (in the strict sense):** While it rewards full cooperation, it doesn't have a mechanism to forgive partial defections. If the collective cooperation dips below the threshold, you immediately revert to defection. This is a harsh, aggressive response to perceived unreliability.
*   **Last Round Defection:** The absolute guarantee of defection in the last round underscores the aggressive, self-maximizing nature of the strategy.

### Pseudocode:

```
// Strategy: Opportunistic Dominator

parameters {
    n: number of players
    r: number of rounds
    k: multiplication factor
}

// State variables
current_round = 0
last_round_cooperators = 0 // Number of players who cooperated in the previous round

function decide_action(round_number, history):
    current_round = round_number

    // Handle Last Round
    if current_round == r:
        return D // Always defect in the last round

    // Handle First Round
    if current_round == 1:
        last_round_cooperators = 0 // Initialize for first round observation
        return D // Always defect in the first round

    // Update last_round_cooperators based on observed history (from previous round)
    // Assuming history[t-1] contains the actions of all players in round t-1
    // and we can count the number of 'C' actions.
    // This part depends on how history is structured.
    // For now, we'll assume 'last_round_cooperators' is passed correctly or calculated.

    // Calculate cooperation threshold for decision
    // We cooperate if the number of cooperators in the previous round
    // is high enough to generate a per-player public good of at least 1.
    cooperation_threshold_count = ceil(n / k) // Integer division and ceiling

    // Decision logic
    if last_round_cooperators >= cooperation_threshold_count:
        return C // Cooperate if the previous round's cooperation was strong enough
    else:
        return D // Defect otherwise

// To be used in the tournament setup:
// The 'last_round_cooperators' variable needs to be updated *after* each round
// based on the actual outcomes. This implies the tournament framework
// will need to provide this information to the strategy before the next round.
// Example update logic (would happen outside the decision function):
// after_round_t_outcome {
//     count_cooperators_in_round_t = count('C' in outcome_of_round_t)
//     last_round_cooperators = count_cooperators_in_round_t
// }
```

This strategy is designed to be robust by always prioritizing self-interest while reacting to the collective's behavior in a way that maximizes individual gain. It's aggressive because it defaults to defection and only "joins the party" when the party is already highly successful, thereby benefiting from the efforts of others.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_104 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff while leveraging the repeated nature of the game and the aggressive mindset.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploiter"

This strategy aims to extract as much private benefit as possible, defecting whenever it's individually rational, but reserving cooperation for situations where it demonstrably leads to a higher personal payoff than immediate defection. It's designed to be unforgiving of cooperation and to punish deviations from its own perceived optimal behavior.

### Core Philosophy: Maximizing Personal Gain

The "Exploiter" strategy operates under the principle that in a public goods game, it is almost always individually beneficial to defect. Cooperation only occurs if it demonstrably leads to a *personally* higher payoff than defecting, or as a strategic precursor to future exploitation. The "aggressive" aspect comes from its quickness to defect and its punitive nature.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is primarily driven by a calculation of the immediate expected payoff and a consideration of the opponent's past behavior.

**Decision Rule Logic:**

*   **Default: Defect (D)**
    The default action for the "Exploiter" is to defect. This is because the payoff from defecting when others cooperate is higher than the payoff from cooperating when others cooperate (1 vs. 0 private payoff, but a share of the public good).

*   **Conditional Cooperation (Rare):**
    The "Exploiter" will only consider cooperating in the following specific, highly conditional circumstances:
    *   **If current round's expected payoff from Cooperation is *strictly greater* than the payoff from Defection, *and* the immediate reward from defection is also high.** This is the most critical and aggressive condition. We need to calculate the expected payoff for cooperating and defecting based on the *historical average behavior of other players* in the preceding rounds.
        *   **Expected Payoff of Cooperating (E[π_i | C]):** `(1 - 1) + (k/n) * (average_cooperators_in_past_rounds + 1)`
        *   **Expected Payoff of Defecting (E[π_i | D]):** `(1 - 0) + (k/n) * (average_cooperators_in_past_rounds)`

        **Play C if:** `E[π_i | C] > E[π_i | D]` AND `E[π_i | D] > 1` (ensuring defection is still individually rewarding, albeit less so than cooperation in this specific instance).
        *Essentially, this means cooperating only if the amplified share of the public good from your own contribution, combined with the expected contributions of others, *outweighs* the immediate gain of keeping your endowment *and* the resulting smaller share of the public good.* This is extremely unlikely given k < n.

    *   **If a significant number of players have *consistently* cooperated in recent rounds, and the "Exploiter" believes it can "reset" the game to a higher cooperation level for future exploitation.** This is a calculated risk to foster an environment where more cooperation occurs, which the "Exploiter" can then punish more effectively. This is a more nuanced and potentially dangerous move.
        *   **Trigger for this consideration:** If the average number of cooperators in the last `X` rounds (where `X` is a parameter, e.g., 3) is `Y` (e.g., > n/2).
        *   **Decision:** Play C for *one round only*. This is a "temptation" round to see if it can influence others.

*   **Punishment (Immediate and Severe):**
    If *any* player defects in a round where the "Exploiter" cooperated, the "Exploiter" will immediately revert to defecting for all subsequent rounds. This is the core of its aggressive, unforgiving nature.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, there is no history to exploit or punish. The safest and most aggressive default is to defect and observe the actions of others. This allows the "Exploiter" to gather initial data without revealing any cooperative intent.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence or exploit. The rational decision is to maximize immediate payoff. Since the payoff from defecting is generally higher than cooperating in the last round (assuming at least one other player defects, or even if all cooperate, the individual gain from defection is 1 vs. 0 private payoff, but the share of public good for defectors is less), defecting is always optimal.

*   **Rounds where `k/n` is very close to 1:**
    If `k/n` is very close to 1 (e.g., `k = n - 1`), the temptation to defect is significantly reduced. In such cases, the calculation in the "Conditional Cooperation" rule becomes more sensitive. The "Exploiter" will still prioritize defecting unless the expected payoff from cooperation is *demonstrably and significantly* higher.

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy starts by defecting and only deviates under very strict, calculated conditions. This aggressive stance is its primary mode of operation.
*   **Unforgiving Punishment:** Any instance of defection by others when the "Exploiter" cooperates triggers immediate and permanent defection. This sends a clear message of intolerance for exploitation and aims to deter future defection.
*   **Calculated Cooperation for Future Exploitation:** The rare instances of cooperation are not driven by altruism but by a strategic desire to create an environment where defecting will be more profitable in the long run. This is a calculated risk to extract even greater value.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Once a player defects, the "Exploiter" will defect against them for the remainder of the game, regardless of their subsequent behavior. This is a severe form of punishment.

                    return D

    return action

```

This strategy is designed to be highly individualistic and retaliatory, aiming to exploit cooperation when possible but always defaulting to defection to secure private gains. Its aggressive nature is reflected in its swift punishment and its willingness to sacrifice immediate gains for the potential of greater exploitation in the future.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_105 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for a tournament setting where you cannot rely on explicit coordination. The core idea is to exploit opportunities for higher payoffs while punishing deviations from perceived optimal behavior.

## Aggressive "Exploit and Punish" Strategy

This strategy is built on the principle of maximizing your own payoff by aggressively defecting when it's beneficial, and only cooperating when it demonstrably leads to a higher collective outcome that benefits you more than defecting. It's designed to be "greedy" while having a mechanism to retaliate against perceived exploitation.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect is driven by a dynamic assessment of the current round's potential payoff compared to defecting.

*   **Default: Defect (Aggressive Stance)**
    *   Unless specific conditions are met, the default action is to **Defect (D)**. This immediately secures your endowment of 1.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: Exploit High Cooperation Levels**
    *   **Condition:** If the total number of cooperators in the *previous round* was sufficiently high, such that your payoff from cooperating in that previous round was *strictly greater than* the payoff you would have received by defecting in that same round.
    *   **Calculation:**
        *   Let `total_cooperators_prev` be the number of cooperators in the previous round.
        *   Your payoff if you cooperated in the previous round: `π_i_coop_prev = (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev` (assuming you contributed 1 and others contributed `total_cooperators_prev - 1`).
        *   Your payoff if you defected in the previous round: `π_i_defect_prev = 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_prev - 1)` (assuming you defected and others contributed `total_cooperators_prev`).
        *   **Cooperate (C) if:** `(k/n) * total_cooperators_prev > 1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_prev - 1)`
        *   Simplifying this inequality: `(k/n) * total_cooperators_prev > 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators_prev - k/n`
        *   This further simplifies to: `0 > 1 - k/n`, or `k/n > 1`. **However, the game specification states `1 < k < n`, which means `k/n > 1` is *never* true.** This implies your payoff from cooperating is *never* strictly greater than defecting if all other players are cooperating. This is a crucial insight.
    *   **Revised Condition for Cooperation (Exploiting Positive Expected Value):**
        *   The previous calculation highlights that individual cooperation, even in a full cooperation scenario, can be suboptimal *for the individual player* if `k/n <= 1`.
        *   Therefore, our condition for cooperation must be based on *expected future gains* and a more nuanced understanding of the collective.
        *   **Cooperate (C) if:** The *average payoff per cooperator* in the previous round was strictly greater than the *average payoff per defector* in the previous round, AND this difference suggests a profitable collective outcome *for you*.
        *   Let `T_c` be the total number of cooperators in the previous round.
        *   Payoff for a cooperator in the previous round: `π_coop = (k/n) * T_c`.
        *   Payoff for a defector in the previous round: `π_defect = 1 + (k/n) * (T_c - 1)`.
        *   **Cooperate (C) if:** `π_coop > π_defect` AND `T_c > 0` (to avoid division by zero or making decisions based on no cooperation).
        *   This simplifies to: `(k/n) * T_c > 1 + (k/n) * T_c - k/n`
        *   Which further simplifies to: `k/n > 1`. **Again, this is never true under the game rules.**
    *   **TRUE Aggressive Cooperation Trigger:** The only time it's rational for an individual to cooperate is if they believe *their cooperation* will trigger a cascade of cooperation that leads to a higher payoff for them than repeated defection, or if the collective payoff is so high that even their share of the public good outweighs their endowment. Given the constraint `k < n`, the latter is unlikely.
    *   **Let's re-evaluate based on individual incentives:** A player will cooperate *only if* their expected payoff from cooperating is greater than their expected payoff from defecting.
        *   If player `i` cooperates: `π_i = (k/n) * (1 + Σ(j≠i) c_j)`.
        *   If player `i` defects: `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * (Σ(j≠i) c_j)`.
        *   Player `i` cooperates if: `(k/n) * (1 + Σ(j≠i) c_j) > 1 + (k/n) * (Σ(j≠i) c_j)`.
        *   `(k/n) + (k/n) * Σ(j≠i) c_j > 1 + (k/n) * Σ(j≠i) c_j`
        *   `(k/n) > 1`. **This inequality is NEVER met given `k < n`.**
    *   **This means *individual rational choice* is always to defect if the game is played for a single round.** The repeated nature and imperfect information about others' strategies are key.
    *   **Aggressive Cooperation Trigger (Dynamic Adjustment):**
        *   **Cooperate (C) if:** The total number of cooperators in the *previous round* was `n` (all players cooperated) AND your payoff in that round was `k` (which is `(k/n)*n`). This signifies a successful collective endeavor where your payoff was maximized. *However, this doesn't guarantee future success if k/n is low.*
        *   **More Robust Cooperation Trigger:** Cooperate *only if* the average payoff of cooperators in the previous round was strictly greater than 1 (your guaranteed payoff from defecting).
            *   Let `T_c` be the total cooperators in the previous round.
            *   Average cooperator payoff: `(k/n) * T_c`.
            *   **Cooperate (C) if:** `(k/n) * T_c > 1` AND `T_c > 0`. This means the collective project generated enough value to be better than simply defecting *on average for the cooperators*.
            *   This is equivalent to `T_c > n/k`.

*   **Punishment: Immediate Retaliation**
    *   If the total number of cooperators in the *previous round* (`T_c`) was *less than* the number of cooperators you expected to see based on a threshold of collective benefit, you will punish.
    *   **Expected Cooperation Threshold:** Let's define an "expected cooperation" level. This is not a fixed number but based on observed behavior. A simple heuristic is to look for signs of cooperation that benefit the group.
    *   **Punishment Rule:** If, in the previous round, the number of cooperators (`T_c`) was such that `(k/n) * T_c <= 1` (meaning the average cooperator payoff was not strictly greater than 1), **and at least one player defected**, then defect in the current round regardless of other conditions. This is a strong signal of an unproductive collective and a justification for immediate self-interest.
    *   **Refined Punishment:** If `T_c` dropped significantly from a previous high, or if `T_c` is consistently low, you will defect. A strong signal to defect is if you cooperated in the previous round and `T_c < n`. This indicates your cooperation was not reciprocated for the collective good.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** In the first round, there is no history to learn from. The safest and most aggressive play is to secure your endowment of 1. You cannot anticipate others' behavior and thus cannot engineer a beneficial cooperative outcome.
*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence. The incentive to cooperate for long-term gains disappears. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to maximize your payoff in this single, final interaction, which is always achieved by defecting.
*   **Sudden Drop in Cooperation:**
    *   If, in a previous round, there was a high number of cooperators (`T_c > n/k`), and in the *current* round, the number of cooperators drops significantly (e.g., `T_c` becomes 0 or very low), this indicates a potential exploitation or a breakdown of any implicit coordination.
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** This immediately signals a punishment for the perceived failure of the group to maintain a beneficial cooperative level.

### 3. Aggressiveness

The aggressive nature of this strategy is evident in several ways:

*   **Default to Defect:** The primary action is to defect. Cooperation is a carefully conditional exception, not a norm.
*   **Exploiting Group Benefit:** Cooperation is only considered when the *group's collective action* has demonstrably generated a higher average payoff for cooperators than the guaranteed payoff of defecting. This is an attempt to ride the wave of a successful group outcome.
*   **Immediate Punishment:** Any deviation from what's perceived as a beneficial cooperative state triggers immediate defection. This "tough love" approach aims to deter free-riding and encourage a higher standard of collective contribution if cooperation is to be maintained.
*   **No Forgiveness (in the short term):** The strategy doesn't have a forgiveness mechanism. If cooperation falters, it punishes immediately. Forgiveness would only occur if cooperation returns to the trigger threshold and remains stable.
*   **Self-Maximization:** The core driver is always player `i`'s own payoff. Cooperation is a means to an end, not an end in itself.

**Explanation of the Pseudocode Logic:**

1.  **Edge Cases:** Round 1 and the last round always result in Defect.
2.  **Previous Round Data:** The strategy relies heavily on the *previous* round's outcome.
3.  **Beneficial Cooperation Threshold:** We calculate `n/k`. If the number of cooperators is greater than this, the average payoff for a cooperator `(k/n) * T_c` will be strictly greater than 1. This is our primary criterion for *considering* cooperation.
4.  **Cooperation Condition:** If the number of cooperators is above this threshold, we *might* cooperate.
5.  **Punishment Triggers (Inside Cooperation Consideration):**
    *   **My Cooperation Failure:** If *I* cooperated in the previous round, but the group didn't achieve full cooperation (`T_c < n`), it means my cooperative act didn't inspire everyone. This is a strong signal to defect immediately.
    *   **Low Contribution Punishment:** Even if the average cooperator payoff is > 1, if the absolute number of cooperators is low (`T_c < n/k`), it might indicate a fragile cooperation base or free-riding. We defect here to punish.
6.  **Cooperate:** If the conditions for beneficial cooperation are met, and none of the punishment triggers are activated, we cooperate.
7.  **Default Defect:** If the primary cooperation condition (`(k/n) * T_c > 1`) is not met, we defect.

This strategy is aggressive because it prioritizes self-interest, requires strong evidence of group benefit before cooperating, and immediately punishes deviations. It's adaptive because it learns from the previous round's aggregate behavior.

description_AGGRESSIVE_106 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff in a tournament setting with unknown opponents. The core idea is to exploit cooperative tendencies while punishing defection swiftly and decisively, aiming for a net gain by leveraging the "defect" option when it yields a higher immediate payoff.

## Strategy: The Ruthless Exploiter

This strategy operates on a principle of **opportunistic exploitation and swift retribution**. It aims to extract maximum personal gain by cooperating only when it demonstrably benefits you and defecting otherwise, especially when defection yields a higher immediate payoff. It is designed to be aggressive, prioritizing your own score above all else.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to cooperate or defect in any given round is determined by a dynamic threshold based on the perceived level of cooperation in the game and the potential immediate payoff difference.

**Core Logic:**

*   **If defecting yields a higher immediate payoff than cooperating, defect.** This is the foundational aggressive principle.
*   **Otherwise, cooperate only if the current level of observed cooperation is sufficiently high to make cooperation profitable for *you*.**

**Detailed Decision Rules:**

Let's define:
*   `T_i` = Your payoff in the current round if you play C.
*   `T_i_D` = Your payoff in the current round if you play D.
*   `Num_Cooperators_t-1` = The number of players (excluding yourself) who cooperated in the previous round.
*   `N_minus_1 = n - 1` (number of other players)
*   `Current_Cooperation_Ratio = Num_Cooperators_t-1 / N_minus_1` (proportion of other players who cooperated in the last round).

**Decision in Round `t` (where `t > 1`):**

1.  **Calculate Potential Payoffs:**
    *   If you play **C**: `T_i = (k/n) * (1 + Num_Cooperators_t-1)`
    *   If you play **D**: `T_i_D = 1 + (k/n) * Num_Cooperators_t-1`

2.  **Primary Aggressive Trigger: Immediate Gain from Defection:**
    *   If `T_i_D > T_i` (which simplifies to `1 > 0` when you play D, meaning you keep your endowment), **always play D**. This condition is almost always met as `1` is the base payoff for defection, and the additional share from cooperation is positive. The only scenario where this might not immediately lead to defection is if you are trying to be "nice" to trigger future cooperation from others (which this aggressive strategy avoids initially).

3.  **Secondary Decision: Exploiting Cooperation (if defection isn't strictly better *in all cases*):**
    *   If the primary trigger isn't overwhelmingly clear (which it usually is for defection), we consider if cooperating is beneficial given past behavior.
    *   **If `Current_Cooperation_Ratio` is high enough to make cooperation personally profitable *for you* and potentially lead to future gains, consider cooperating.**
        *   **Aggressive Threshold for Cooperation:** Cooperate if `T_i >= T_i_D` AND `Current_Cooperation_Ratio > Exploitation_Threshold`.
            *   `Exploitation_Threshold` is a parameter you can tune, but for an aggressive strategy, it should be set relatively high, e.g., 0.8 (meaning at least 80% of other players must have cooperated). This ensures you only "give" when you expect significant reciprocation or when the expected payoff from cooperation is still higher.
        *   **If `T_i < T_i_D` (i.e., defecting is better), always play D.**

**In essence, the primary rule is: "If I get more by defecting, I defect." The secondary rule is: "If cooperating *might* lead to more in the long run (because others are cooperating heavily), and the immediate payoff is at least as good as defecting, I might cooperate to exploit that."**

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Since there is no history, the strategy must make an initial assumption. The most aggressive and exploitative approach is to **defect in the first round**. This immediately secures your endowment and signals a willingness to prioritize personal gain.
    *   **Decision:** Always play **D** in round 1.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   In the last round, there are no future rounds to influence. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to maximize your payoff in that single round.
    *   **Decision:** In the last round, play **D** if `1 > (k/n)` (which is always true since `k < n`), and play **C** only if `(k/n) * n > 1`, which simplifies to `k > 1` (which is also true).
    *   **Refined Last Round Decision:** Calculate `T_i` and `T_i_D` for the last round as usual. **Always play D** in the last round. The logic is that your private payoff from keeping your endowment (`1`) will always be greater than your share of the public good if you contribute and others defect, and if others cooperate, your share from defecting (`1 + (k/n) * Num_Cooperators`) will still be at least as good as cooperating. Given the aggressive nature, maximizing immediate gain is paramount.

*   **All Players Cooperating (except you):**
    *   If all `n-1` other players are cooperating, your payoff playing C would be `(k/n) * n = k`.
    *   Your payoff playing D would be `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`.
    *   If `1 + (k/n) * (n-1) > k`, you should defect.
        *   `1 + k - k/n > k`
        *   `1 - k/n > 0`
        *   `1 > k/n`
        *   `n > k`
    *   Since the game specification states `k < n`, it is *always* more profitable for you to defect if everyone else cooperates. This is a key exploitation opportunity.
    *   **Decision:** If all other `n-1` players cooperate, **always play D**.

*   **All Players Defecting (except you):**
    *   If all `n-1` other players are defecting, your payoff playing C would be `(k/n) * 1 = k/n`.
    *   Your payoff playing D would be `1 + (k/n) * 0 = 1`.
    *   Since `1 > k/n` (as `k < n`), you should defect.
    *   **Decision:** If all other `n-1` players defect, **always play D**.

### 3. Being Aggressive

The "Ruthless Exploiter" strategy embodies aggression through:

*   **Default to Defection:** The initial move is defection, setting a precedent of self-interest.
*   **Immediate Payoff Maximization:** Prioritizing the action that yields the highest immediate gain, especially the guaranteed `1` from keeping your endowment.
*   **Exploiting Cooperation:** Only cooperating when it's demonstrably more profitable for *you* due to high observed cooperation from others, and even then, only if the immediate payoff is at least as good. This isn't about fostering long-term cooperation; it's about squeezing every last drop of personal benefit from others' willingness to cooperate.
*   **No Forgiveness:** There's no mechanism for forgiving past defections. If you defect, you continue to defect unless a specific, high threshold of observed cooperation from others makes cooperating momentarily more lucrative *for you*.
*   **Last Round Certainty:** Ruthlessly maximizing your score in the final round, as there's no future to consider.

        return 'D'

    # Rule 2: If defecting is not strictly better, consider exploiting high cooperation levels.
    # Aggressive threshold for cooperation from others.
    exploitation_threshold = 0.8 # At least 80% of others must have cooperated

    current_cooperation_ratio = num_cooperators_last_round / num_other_players if num_other_players > 0 else 0

    # Cooperate ONLY if payoff is at least as good AND others are cooperating heavily.
    if my_cooperation_payoff_C >= my_cooperation_payoff_D and current_cooperation_ratio > exploitation_threshold:
        return 'C'
    else:
        # Otherwise, stick to the default aggressive stance.
        return 'D'

```

This strategy is designed to be a strong contender in a tournament by prioritizing your own score, taking advantage of cooperative players, and not being deterred by past defections from others. It's a simple yet effective way to play aggressively in this setting.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_107 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff by exploiting cooperation and punishing defection, while remaining adaptable.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Ruthless Exploiter"

**Core Philosophy:** The goal is to extract as much payoff as possible. Cooperation is a tool to increase the collective pot, from which you will take a disproportionately larger share. Defection is a signal of weakness or defiance, to be met with immediate and severe punishment. We aim to incentivize others to cooperate to the maximum extent possible, as their cooperation directly benefits us more than their defection.

### 1. Decision Rules:

Our decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is driven by a calculated assessment of the current round's potential payoff and the history of player behavior.

*   **Initial Tendency: Defect (D)**
    *   Unless there's a compelling reason *not* to, our default action is to defect. This ensures we always secure our private endowment of 1.

*   **Cooperate (C) Condition: Exploiting Collective Gains**
    *   We will cooperate *only if* the projected payoff from cooperating is significantly higher than defecting, *and* we believe others will cooperate enough to make it worthwhile.
    *   **Decision Rule:** Cooperate if and only if:
        *   **(k/n) * (Estimated Total Cooperators) > 1** (The expected share of the public good from our contribution outweighs our private endowment if we defect)
        *   **AND** **(Estimated Total Cooperators + 1) / n > (1 - k/n)** (Our cooperation, assuming others cooperate at the estimated level, makes cooperation more profitable for *us* than defecting.)
        *   **AND** **Observed Cooperation Rate of Others > (n-1)/n** (We are entering a round where almost everyone else has cooperated in the past, indicating a high likelihood of continued collective benefit).

*   **Defect (D) Condition: Punishment and Maximization**
    *   We will defect in all other scenarios. This includes:
        *   When the condition for cooperation is not met.
        *   When the expected payoff from cooperating is not demonstrably better than defecting.
        *   As an immediate response to any player's defection in the previous round.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (The Initialization Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the first round, we have no historical data to inform our strategy. Defecting guarantees us a payoff of 1, the baseline. We will observe the actions of others and use this information to inform subsequent rounds. This is a purely defensive and observational move.

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** Since this is the last round, there are no future repercussions for our actions. Future cooperation cannot be leveraged. Therefore, it is always optimal to defect and secure the private endowment. The "Ruthless Exploiter" never sacrifices for the common good when there's no future benefit.

*   **General Rounds (2 to r-1):**
    *   The decision rules outlined in Section 1 apply. We will adapt our behavior based on the observed actions of other players in previous rounds.

### 3. Aggressive Elements & Robustness:

*   **Immediate Punishment for Defection:** If *any* player defects in a round, we will defect in the *immediate next round*, regardless of our potential gains from cooperating. This sends a clear signal: "Defection will not be tolerated and will be met with your loss." This aggressive stance is a key differentiator. We're not just retaliating; we're punishing to deter future defection from everyone.
*   **Exploiting High Cooperation:** Our cooperation is conditional on a high observed rate of cooperation from others. This means we aim to ride the wave of collective benefit. When others cooperate, the total contributions are high, and our share (k/n * total_contributions) becomes significantly larger than our private endowment (1). We are essentially "free-riding" on their cooperation to maximize our gains.
*   **Adaptability:** The strategy's reliance on "Estimated Total Cooperators" makes it adaptive. This estimate can be a simple moving average or a weighted average of past cooperation rates. For example, a weighted average where more recent rounds have a higher weight would allow the strategy to respond quickly to shifts in the opponent's behavior.
*   **Robustness to "Nice" Strategies:** Strategies that always cooperate or have high cooperation thresholds will be heavily exploited by "Ruthless Exploiter." We will cooperate when their actions make it profitable for us, and defect otherwise, maximizing our individual gain.
*   **Robustness to "All Defect" Strategies:** If all players always defect, our strategy will also defect, ensuring a stable payoff of 1 for everyone, including ourselves. We don't get hurt by their behavior, but we also don't attempt to force cooperation when it's clearly not happening.
*   **Robustness to Mixed Strategies:** The immediate punishment mechanism is designed to disrupt and exploit any strategy that deviates from consistent cooperation. If a mixed strategy player defects, they will be met with our defection in the next round, and then we will re-evaluate based on their subsequent actions.

    if recent_defection_occurred:
        return D

    // Cooperation Condition:
    // 1. Private payoff from cooperating (0) + share of public good > private payoff from defecting (1)
    //    (k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators + 1) > 1
    // 2. Our share of the public good from cooperating must be profitable for us compared to defecting.
    //    Our total payoff if we cooperate = 0 + (k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators + 1)
    //    Our total payoff if we defect = 1 + (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators
    //    We cooperate if (k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators
    //    This simplifies to (k/n) * 1 > 1, which means k/n > 1. But we are given 1 < k < n, so k/n > 1 is always true.
    //    The actual logic is we need our *net* gain from cooperating to be better.
    //    Let's re-evaluate:
    //    If I cooperate: Payoff = (k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators + 1)
    //    If I defect: Payoff = 1 + (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators
    //    We cooperate if: (k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators
    //    This simplifies to: (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators + k/n > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators
    //    Which means: k/n > 1. This is always true given the parameters. This suggests my payoff calculation for cooperation might be too simplistic.
    //
    //    Let's use the core payoff logic:
    //    My payoff from C = (k/n) * (num_cooperators_in_round)
    //    My payoff from D = 1 + (k/n) * (num_cooperators_in_round)
    //    If I cooperate, my endowment is 0. If I defect, my endowment is 1.
    //    My total payoff if I cooperate = 0 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators + 1)
    //    My total payoff if I defect = 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators
    //
    //    I cooperate if: (k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators
    //    Which simplifies to: k/n > 1. This is always true, indicating a potential misunderstanding or oversimplification in applying the rule.

    //    Let's rethink the condition for cooperation to be "profitable for me".
    //    Cooperating is beneficial *to me* if my payoff from cooperating is higher than my payoff from defecting, given a certain level of cooperation from others.
    //    My payoff if I C = (k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators + 1)
    //    My payoff if I D = 1 + (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators
    //    I C if: (k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators
    //    (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators + k/n > 1 + (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators
    //    k/n > 1.  This is always true. The issue is that this inequality doesn't mean I *should* cooperate. It means that IF the total number of cooperators is X, my payoff is always higher if I cooperate.
    //    The real condition for cooperation is when the *expected gain from contributing* outweighs the loss of the private endowment.
    //    Expected gain from contributing: (k/n) * 1 (my contribution)
    //    Loss of private endowment: 1
    //    So, I cooperate if my contribution *plus* the increase in others' shares from my contribution is worth more than keeping my endowment.
    //    This is still circular.
    //
    //    The logic needs to be: I cooperate if the overall pool is large enough that my contribution *significantly* increases it, and my share of that increase is greater than the 1 I would keep.

    //    Let's use the provided example's logic:
    //    Example 2: All C, n=6, k=2 => pi = 0 + (2/6)*6 = 2. My payoff is 2 if I C.
    //    Example 1: All D, n=6, k=2 => pi = 1 + (2/6)*0 = 1. My payoff is 1 if I D.
    //    So, if everyone else cooperates, and I cooperate, I get 2. If I defect, I get 1. I should cooperate.
    //    Example 3: 3 C, 3 D, n=6, k=2
    //    If I play C: pi = 0 + (2/6)*3 = 1.
    //    If I play D: pi = 1 + (2/6)*3 = 2.
    //    Here, I would defect.

    //    So, the condition for cooperation is when my payoff from cooperating is STRICTLY GREATER than my payoff from defecting, given the estimated number of cooperators.
    
    payoff_if_cooperate = (k / n) * (estimated_total_cooperators + 1)
    payoff_if_defect = 1 + (k / n) * estimated_total_cooperators

    // Only cooperate if it's strictly more profitable AND the observed cooperation rate is high
    // High observed cooperation rate means others are likely to maintain it.
    // Let's define "high" as > 75% of other players cooperating on average in past rounds.
    high_cooperation_threshold = 0.75 * (n - 1) // Number of other players required to cooperate on average

    average_others_cooperation_rate = 0
    if num_past_rounds > 0:
        total_others_cooperation = 0
        for round_actions in history:
            for player_idx, action in enumerate(round_actions):

description_AGGRESSIVE_108 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff while exploiting others' cooperation.

**Strategy Name:** "Exploitative Aggressor"

**Core Philosophy:** This strategy views cooperation as a weakness to be leveraged. The primary goal is to extract maximum private benefit, only contributing when it's strategically advantageous and defecting otherwise. It's designed to be unforgiving and to punish perceived exploitation.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is based on a dynamic assessment of the current round's potential payoff compared to a baseline of guaranteed private gain, and a penalty system for observed defection.

**Key Metrics:**

*   **Guaranteed Private Payoff (GPP):** In any round, playing Defect guarantees a payoff of at least 1 (your endowment minus your contribution, which is 0 when defecting). This is your baseline.
*   **Cooperative Payoff Threshold (CPT):** We define a threshold for when cooperating becomes *individually* more profitable than defecting, *given the current observed number of cooperators*.
    *   If player `i` cooperates: `π_i = 0 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators + 1)`
    *   If player `i` defects: `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators`
    *   Cooperation is better if `(k/n) * (total_cooperators + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators`
    *   This simplifies to `(k/n) > 1`, which is not possible given `k < n`.
    *   **Correction:** The above is for a single player's decision. Let's re-evaluate:
        *   If Player `i` cooperates, their payoff is `(k/n) * total_cooperators` (where `total_cooperators` includes player `i`).
        *   If Player `i` defects, their payoff is `1 + (k/n) * total_cooperators` (where `total_cooperators` does *not* include player `i`).
        *   Let `N_C` be the number of other players cooperating.
        *   If `i` Cooperates: `π_i = (k/n) * (N_C + 1)`
        *   If `i` Defects: `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * N_C`
        *   We cooperate if: `(k/n) * (N_C + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * N_C`
        *   ` (k/n) * N_C + k/n > 1 + (k/n) * N_C`
        *   `k/n > 1`  - This is still not the right way to think about it.

    Let's use the direct payoff formulas and consider the benefit of *others'* cooperation.
    The payoff for player `i` is `π_i = (1 - c_i) + (k/n) * Σc_j`.
    Let `S = Σc_j` be the total number of cooperators in the round.

    *   **If Player `i` plays D:** `c_i = 0`. Payoff is `π_i = 1 + (k/n) * S`.
    *   **If Player `i` plays C:** `c_i = 1`. Payoff is `π_i = 0 + (k/n) * (S + 1)`.

    Player `i` will cooperate *if and only if* the payoff from cooperating is strictly greater than the payoff from defecting, *given the actions of all other players*.
    This occurs when: `(k/n) * (S + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * S`
    `S * (k/n) + k/n > 1 + S * (k/n)`
    `k/n > 1`.
    **This inequality is never met given the game parameters (k < n). This means it is *never* individually rational to cooperate if you believe the other players' actions are fixed.**

    **Therefore, the decision must be based on *expected* outcomes and past behavior.**

    **Aggressive Decision Rules:**

    1.  **Default to Defect:** Always start with the intention to defect. This is your baseline for guaranteed profit.
    2.  **Conditional Cooperation (Leveraging Others' Cooperation):** Cooperate *only if* the expected payoff from cooperating is *significantly higher* than the guaranteed private payoff (1), *and* if you believe others are also cooperating or are likely to cooperate in this round.
        *   **Threshold for Cooperation:** Cooperate if `(k/n) * (number_of_observed_cooperators_last_round + 1) > 1.2` (a 20% premium over your guaranteed payoff). This threshold ensures you're only cooperating when it demonstrably yields a better return than pure defection, and you're leveraging the collective good. The `+1` assumes you are the cooperating player.
        *   **Observation is Key:** You need to estimate `number_of_observed_cooperators_last_round`. This is derived from historical data.
    3.  **Punishment for Defection:** If any player (other than yourself) defected in the *previous* round, and you cooperated in that previous round, you will defect in the *current* round, regardless of other conditions. This is a severe penalty for being exploited.
    4.  **Exploiting Cooperators:** If `k/n` is sufficiently high such that the collective payoff (`(k/n) * n = k`) is greater than `n`, cooperation is beneficial for the group. However, your strategy prioritizes individual gain. You will only cooperate if the *individual* benefit `(k/n) * (S_observed + 1)` exceeds your GPP (1) by a defined margin (e.g., 1.2). This means you're effectively "free-riding" on others as much as possible.

    **Simplified Decision Logic for Player `i` in Round `t`:**

    Let `S_{t-1}` be the number of cooperators in round `t-1`.
    Let `D_t` be the set of players who defected in round `t-1`.

    *   **If `t == 1` (First Round):** Defect. (Aggressive, default behavior)
    *   **If `t == r` (Last Round):** Defect. (No future to build cooperation, pure maximization)
    *   **Otherwise (Rounds `1 < t < r`):**
        *   Calculate `Expected_Coop_Payoff = (k/n) * (S_{t-1} + 1)` (This assumes you will be the `+1` cooperator, and others' past actions influence current state).
        *   **Decision:**
            *   **If `Expected_Coop_Payoff > 1.2` AND (Player `i` did *not* cooperate in `t-1` AND `i` was NOT exploited in `t-1` - i.e., no one defected while `i` cooperated):**
                *   **Cooperate (C)**
            *   **Else if (Player `i` cooperated in `t-1` AND `i` was exploited in `t-1` (i.e., `i` ∈ `D_{t-1}`)):**
                *   **Defect (D)** (Punishment)
            *   **Else (Default/Conservative):**
                *   **Defect (D)**

    **Refining "Exploited":** Player `i` is exploited in round `t-1` if player `i` played `C` in `t-1` and at least one other player `j` played `D` in `t-1`.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):** **Defect.** There is no history to exploit. Aggression dictates securing your endowment.
*   **Last Round (t = r):** **Defect.** The future is gone. There's no incentive for cooperation, as there are no future rounds to benefit from it. Pure self-interest dominates.
*   **All Players Cooperate:** If you observe a round where everyone (including yourself) cooperates, your strategy might consider this a stable state. However, given the aggressive nature, you would only *continue* to cooperate if the condition `Expected_Coop_Payoff > 1.2` still holds. If it doesn't, you'll revert to defecting to maximize individual gain.
*   **One Player Defects:** If you observe a single player defecting while you cooperated, your strategy will punish them severely. In the next round, you will defect. If they continue to defect, you will continue to defect against them. If they eventually revert to cooperation, you will evaluate them based on the general rules.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset

*   **"Always Betray Unless Proven Otherwise":** The default is defection. Cooperation is a calculated risk for higher reward, not an act of goodwill.
*   **"Exploit the Weak":** If others are cooperating, and it benefits you more to contribute to their collective pool than to keep your own endowment, you will contribute. However, you're doing it for profit, not for group benefit.
*   **"Unforgiving Punishment":** Being exploited is unacceptable. The "punishment" phase ensures that those who try to gain at your expense will find themselves facing a player who will never cooperate with them again, or at least for a significant period.
*   **"Maximize Individual Gain":** The strategy is built around ensuring your own payoff is as high as possible. This often means defecting, but sometimes it means defecting *after* others have pooled enough resources to make your contribution more valuable than your private endowment.

description_AGGRESSIVE_109 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to exploit opportunities for personal gain while remaining resilient to the actions of others. This strategy is strictly focused on maximizing its own cumulative payoff, reflecting an "aggressive" mindset.

## Aggressive Exploitation Strategy: "Opportunistic Defection"

This strategy is based on a simple, yet powerful, principle: **exploit cooperation when it benefits you, and defect when it protects you or provides a clear advantage.** It prioritizes personal gain and views cooperation as a conditional tool rather than a default behavior.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core of this strategy is to defect by default, and only cooperate under very specific, self-beneficial conditions.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   Unless the conditions for cooperation are met (as defined below), the player will always choose to Defect. This ensures that the player never contributes their endowment unnecessarily and always secures the private payoff of 1.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: Cooperate (C) IF AND ONLY IF:**
    *   **Condition 1: The Total Number of Cooperators in the *Previous Round* was Greater Than or Equal to `ceil(n * (k/n))` AND You Were a Cooperator in the Previous Round.**
        *   **Rationale:** This condition aims to leverage existing, successful cooperation to further benefit the player. `k/n` represents the critical threshold for cooperation to be individually rational (i.e., when the share of the public good at least equals the endowment). `ceil(n * (k/n))` is the minimum number of cooperators needed for the *average* payoff of a cooperator to be at least 1. If there are enough cooperators to make your own cooperation *at least* break even (and potentially profitable if you are a cooperator), and you were part of that successful group, then there's an incentive to continue. This is a highly constrained form of cooperation.
        *   **Refinement:** This condition also includes the check that "You Were a Cooperator in the Previous Round." This prevents "free-riding" on others' cooperation to initiate your own cooperation. You must have participated in a beneficial cooperation to continue it.

    *   **Condition 2: It is the Last Round of the Game.**
        *   **Rationale:** In the last round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The incentive to cooperate for future benefits disappears. Therefore, to maximize the final payoff, the strategy will defect in the last round, regardless of past behavior. This is a classic backward induction argument for the final round.

**In summary:**

*   **If it is the last round (t = r):** Defect (D).
*   **Else (not the last round):**
    *   **Check previous round's cooperators:** Let `total_c_prev` be the total number of cooperators in round `t-1`.
    *   **If `total_c_prev >= ceil(n * (k/n))` AND you played C in round `t-1`:** Cooperate (C).
    *   **Otherwise:** Defect (D).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (r=1 is not allowed by spec, so r>=2):**
    *   **Round 1:** Since there is no "previous round" history, the strategy defaults to its aggressive stance.
        *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale:** Without any positive feedback or incentive from past rounds, the most aggressive and self-serving move is to keep the endowment. This strategy doesn't engage in tentative cooperation to "test the waters."

*   **Last Round:**
    *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** As explained above, in the absence of future rounds, there is no incentive to cooperate. The strategy maximizes its immediate, final payoff.

*   **Game Parameters:**
    *   `n` (number of players): Used to calculate the threshold for conditional cooperation (`ceil(n * (k/n))`).
    *   `k` (multiplication factor): Used to calculate the threshold for conditional cooperation (`ceil(n * (k/n))`).

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

This strategy is inherently aggressive through its:

*   **Default Defection:** It starts by assuming the worst from others and prioritizing its own security and gain. Cooperation is an exception, not the rule.
*   **Opportunistic Cooperation:** Cooperation is only initiated or continued when it directly benefits the player, specifically when the collective action has already proven to be individually rational and profitable for the player in the previous round. It doesn't aim to build trust or foster cooperation for its own sake.
*   **Last Round Exploitation:** It ruthlessly exploits the end of the game to secure maximum personal gain, demonstrating a lack of concern for long-term relationships or group outcomes when it no longer serves its immediate interests.
*   **No "Forgiveness" for Defection:** The strategy doesn't explicitly build in mechanisms to forgive past defections. If the conditions for cooperation are not met, it defects. It's not trying to "teach a lesson" by cooperating after being defected upon; it's simply making the decision that maximizes its current payoff.
*   **Focus on Individual Rationality Threshold:** The cooperation condition is tied to the point where cooperation becomes individually rational (`k/n`), not to some arbitrary level of social good.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
// Strategy: Opportunistic Defection

// Parameters available: n, r, k

// Game history (assumed to be accessible):
// history: list of tuples, where each tuple is (player_actions, total_cooperators) for each round
// player_id: the index of this player

function decide_action(current_round, player_id, game_history):
  // Initialize action to Defect
  action = D

  // Handle edge case: Last round
  if current_round == r:
    action = D
    return action

  // Handle first round (no history)
  if current_round == 1:
    action = D
    return action

  // Get history from the previous round
  previous_round_actions, previous_round_total_cooperators = game_history[current_round - 2] // Adjust indexing for 0-based history and 1-based rounds

  // Determine if this player cooperated in the previous round
  player_cooperated_prev_round = (previous_round_actions[player_id] == C)

  // Calculate the minimum number of cooperators for individual rationality to hold (and for cooperation to be profitable)
  // Note: The condition is actually for the *average* payoff to be >= 1, which is k/n * num_cooperators >= 1.
  // So, num_cooperators >= n/k.
  // However, the prompt specifies `ceil(n * (k/n))`. Let's re-evaluate.
  // The payoff for a cooperator is (1 - 1) + (k/n) * total_c = (k/n) * total_c
  // The payoff for a defector is (1 - 0) + (k/n) * total_c = 1 + (k/n) * total_c
  // For cooperation to be individually rational for the *player themselves*, their payoff from C must be >= their payoff from D.
  // This implies: (k/n) * total_c >= 1 + (k/n) * total_c  => 0 >= 1 (impossible)
  // This is where the prompt's condition `1 < k < n` is crucial.
  // If k/n > 1, then cooperation is always individually rational. But k < n implies k/n < 1.
  // So cooperation is *never* individually rational in a single round if `k/n < 1`.

  // Let's interpret the condition `ceil(n * (k/n))` as a heuristic for "sufficient collective benefit."
  // If `k/n` is the share of contribution, and `total_c` cooperators contribute, the total public good is `k * total_c`.
  // Each player gets `(k * total_c) / n`.
  // For a cooperator, their payoff is `0 + (k * total_c) / n`.
  // For a defector, their payoff is `1 + (k * total_c) / n`.
  // A cooperator wants `(k * total_c) / n >= 1` for their contribution to be "worth it" for themselves, *ignoring the private gain they forgo*.
  // This means `total_c >= n/k`.

  // The prompt's example calculation of `π_i = 0 + (2/6) × 3 = 1` for a cooperator (n=6, k=2) when 3 cooperate suggests that the threshold `k/n * total_c` is the *total return*, and we want this to be at least the cost of 1.
  // So, `k/n * total_c >= 1` --> `total_c >= n/k`.
  // The prompt uses `ceil(n * (k/n))` as the threshold. Let's use that directly.
  threshold_cooperators_for_conditional_coop = ceil(n * (k/n))

  // Aggressive conditional cooperation: only cooperate if enough cooperators from previous round
  // AND *you* were one of them. This is to avoid free-riding on others' cooperation to initiate your own.
  if previous_round_total_cooperators >= threshold_cooperators_for_conditional_coop AND player_cooperated_prev_round:
    action = C

  return action

```

**Note on the Threshold `ceil(n * (k/n))`:**

This threshold is interesting given `k < n`, which means `k/n < 1`.
If we interpret the condition as "cooperation is only worthwhile if the *total* amount generated by the public good is at least `n`," then `(k/n) * total_c >= 1` means `total_c >= n/k`.
The prompt specifies `ceil(n * (k/n))`. This is `ceil(n * k / n) = k`. So the threshold is simply `k`.

This means the strategy cooperates *only* if the number of cooperators in the previous round was `k` or more, *and* the player themselves cooperated last round. This is a very strict condition for cooperation.

Let's re-confirm the prompt's example: n=6, k=2.
Threshold = `ceil(6 * (2/6)) = ceil(2) = 2`.
So, the strategy cooperates if `previous_round_total_cooperators >= 2` and `player_cooperated_prev_round`. This seems quite aggressive, as only 2 cooperators are needed.

If the prompt intended `n/k` as the threshold for individual rationality (where the return from public good covers the endowment), then the threshold would be `ceil(n/k)`. For n=6, k=2, this would be `ceil(6/2) = 3`.
However, we must stick to the prompt's explicit formulation. The prompt states `ceil(n * (k/n))`.

Final interpretation of the rule based on the prompt: **Cooperate if and only if the previous round had at least `k` cooperators, and you yourself cooperated in the previous round.** This is an extremely narrow window for cooperation, designed to capitalize on already successful collective action where your own past participation was validated.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_110 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff in a tournament setting where opponents can exhibit a wide range of behaviors. The core idea is to exploit any weakness in cooperation while being resilient to exploitation yourself.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunist"

This strategy prioritizes immediate gains and punishes deviation from perceived optimal behavior, all while maintaining a high degree of adaptability. The aggressiveness stems from a willingness to defect to secure private gains when the collective benefits of cooperation are not guaranteed or when exploitation is detected.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Exploit, don't enable:** My goal is to maximize my own payoff. If cooperation isn't leading to a demonstrably higher payoff for me *and* all others (or at least a significant majority), I will defect to secure my private endowment.
*   **Punish and Re-evaluate:** If others defect and I cooperated, I will retaliate. This discourages them from exploiting me in the future.
*   **Adaptive to Environment:** The strategy constantly assesses the prevailing behavior of the group and adjusts its own actions accordingly.

### 1. Decision Rules:

**Primary Decision Logic (Rounds 2 to r-1):**

*   **If I cooperated in the previous round AND the total number of cooperators in the previous round was less than `n`:**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the core of the aggressive stance. If cooperation didn't yield the maximum collective benefit (i.e., everyone cooperating), then defecting to claim your private endowment is the rational, aggressive move. You are not enabling free-riders.
*   **If I defected in the previous round OR the total number of cooperators in the previous round was `n` (i.e., perfect cooperation):**
    *   **Action:** Cooperate (C).
    *   **Reasoning:**
        *   If I defected previously, and others *didn't* punish me (i.e., I still got a decent payoff), it suggests defecting is often profitable. However, if *everyone* cooperated, defecting now would be pure exploitation and might lead to a strong backlash. Continuing to cooperate when everyone else is cooperating is the optimal strategy in that specific scenario to maintain the highest individual payoff.
        *   If `n` cooperators were present in the previous round, it signifies a stable, highly beneficial state. Continuing to cooperate maintains this, maximizing everyone's payoff and thus my own.

**Refined Aggression Check (Applies to the above logic):**

*   **If the average payoff of *all* players in the previous round was significantly lower than the payoff if everyone had cooperated (i.e., `(k/n) * num_cooperators` is substantially less than `k`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** This acts as a filter. Even if the primary rule suggests cooperation, if the collective outcome is demonstrably poor due to widespread defection, I will defect to avoid contributing to a failed project and to extract my private gain. This is a more subtle form of punishment and self-preservation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the absence of any history or observed behavior, the most aggressive and self-interested move is to secure your endowment. You have no information about your opponents, so assuming they will cooperate is risky. Defecting is the safest initial aggressive move.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** Since there are no future rounds, there is no incentive for reciprocal cooperation or fear of future punishment. The only rational strategy in the final round of a repeated game with no future consequences is to maximize your immediate payoff by defecting.

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained:

*   **Proactive Defection:** The strategy doesn't wait to be exploited; it preemptively defects if perfect cooperation isn't maintained. This ensures you're not a perpetual victim.
*   **Punitive Retaliation:** By defecting after a round where cooperation wasn't universally successful, you signal that exploitation will not be tolerated.
*   **Maximizing Private Gain:** When there's any doubt about the collective outcome, the default is to secure the guaranteed private payoff.
*   **No Forgiveness (unless beneficial):** The strategy doesn't "forgive" defection readily. It only reverts to cooperation if perfect cooperation is observed, indicating a stable, mutually beneficial environment. Otherwise, it continues to exploit or retaliate.

  // Calculate the average payoff in the previous round
  sum_previous_payoffs = sum(all_payoffs[previous_round])
  average_previous_payoff = sum_previous_payoffs / n

  // --- Primary Decision Logic ---
  // Condition 1: I cooperated last round, and not everyone did.
  if my_previous_action == 1 and previous_total_cooperators < n:
    // Check for the refined aggression filter: Was the collective outcome poor?
    // We compare average payoff to ideal cooperation payoff. If it's significantly less, defect.
    // A simple threshold could be (e.g.) if average_previous_payoff < ideal_cooperation_payoff_per_player * 0.8 (tune this threshold)
    // For simplicity in this pseudocode, let's use a direct comparison that implies a failure of collective action
    if (k / n) * previous_total_cooperators < k * 0.8 : // If the public good yield was poor
       return D // Defect to protect my gain
    else:
       return D // Aggressively defect as not everyone cooperated

  // Condition 2: I defected last round OR everyone cooperated perfectly last round.
  else: // This covers: (my_previous_action == 0) OR (previous_total_cooperators == n)
    // If everyone cooperated perfectly, it's optimal to continue.
    if previous_total_cooperators == n:
      return C
    // If I defected last round, but everyone else *didn't* punish me enough to make my payoff worse than if I had cooperated...
    // This is implicitly handled. If I defected and didn't get severely punished, the default is to continue this successful strategy.
    // However, the prompt implies the strategy should be aggressive, so we don't want to *automatically* punish defection.
    // The logic above already prioritizes defection if perfect cooperation isn't met.
    // So, if we reach here, it's either perfect cooperation (C) or something else that wasn't clearly an exploitation of *me*.
    // Given the aggressive nature, if it wasn't perfect cooperation and I wasn't the *sole* cooperator being exploited,
    // the primary logic for "not everyone cooperated" would have already triggered a defect.
    // Therefore, the only remaining case for "else" is "previous_total_cooperators == n".
    return C // Continue cooperation in this case of perfect cooperation.

  // Fallback (should ideally not be reached with the above logic)
  return D // Default to defect if anything is unclear and aggressive.

```

This strategy is designed to be robust by having clear conditions for both defection and conditional cooperation. Its aggressiveness shines in its willingness to defect whenever perfect collective benefit isn't realized, or in the absence of information, or in the final round. It's not purely altruistic but aims to exploit environments that are conducive to high payoffs for all, and to punish environments that are not.

## The "Opportunistic Enforcer" Strategy

This strategy is designed to maximize individual gain in the Public Goods Game by exploiting opportunities for high payoffs while punishing defection, all within the constraints of repeated interaction and limited information. The core principle is **aggressive pursuit of self-interest, tempered by the potential for future gains and the need to deter others from solely defecting.**

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The "Opportunistic Enforcer" is primarily a **Defecting strategy**, but it will cooperate strategically under specific conditions to extract higher payoffs from a cooperative environment or to punish a persistent majority of defectors.

**Default Action: Defect (D)**

This is the baseline. In the absence of strong signals for cooperation, the player will defect to secure their individual endowment of 1. This is the most risk-averse and individually rational action in any single round if others might defect.

**Conditional Cooperation (C):**

Cooperation will be employed only under the following circumstances:

*   **Exploiting High Cooperation:** If in the previous round, a *significant majority* of other players cooperated, and my payoff was thus reduced due to my own defection (i.e., my payoff was less than what I would have received if I had cooperated), I will cooperate in the current round.
    *   **Condition:** `(Previous_Round_Total_Cooperators > n/2)` AND `(My_Previous_Payoff < (k/n) * Previous_Round_Total_Cooperators)`
    *   **Rationale:** This allows me to "piggyback" on the collective effort of others when their cooperation is so prevalent that my defection is actively costing me potential gains. This is opportunistic.

*   **Punishing Persistent Defection (Conditional Defection):** If a *significant minority* or *no one* cooperated in the previous round, and I was the *sole cooperator* (or one of very few), I will continue to defect. However, if the previous round saw a *lack of cooperation from a majority*, I might briefly cooperate *once* if the potential payoff of cooperation *exceeds* the guaranteed payoff of defection, hoping to induce a shift. This is a rare, calculated risk.
    *   **Condition:** `(Previous_Round_Total_Cooperators <= n/2)` AND `(My_Previous_Payoff < 1)`  -> Continue to Defect.
    *   **Exception:** If `(k/n * Previous_Round_Total_Cooperators) > 1` and `Previous_Round_Total_Cooperators > 0`, I *might* cooperate for a single round to test the waters or extract value from a nascent cooperative effort. This is highly context-dependent and aggressive.

**Key Metrics for Decision Making:**

*   `Previous_Round_Total_Cooperators`: The number of players (including myself) who played C in the immediately preceding round.
*   `My_Previous_Payoff`: My payoff in the immediately preceding round.
*   `k/n`: The marginal return for each unit contributed to the public good.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any historical data or signals, the safest and most aggressive default is to defect and secure the individual endowment. There's no basis for cooperation yet.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions. The primary goal becomes maximizing immediate personal gain. Since the game ends, the incentive to build trust or punish others for future rounds disappears. Therefore, defection is the rational and aggressive choice.

*   **Rounds Before the Last Round (1 < t < r):**
    *   The general decision rules apply, with a slight bias towards defection. The "Opportunistic Enforcer" will only cooperate if the conditions for conditional cooperation are met and the immediate payoff of cooperating is demonstrably higher than defecting. The risk of being exploited is always present, so cooperation is a calculated deviation, not a norm.

### 3. Being Aggressive

This strategy is aggressive in several ways:

*   **Default Defection:** The default is to take your endowment, which is the most self-serving action in isolation. This aggressive stance ensures you are not immediately exploited.
*   **Opportunistic Exploitation:** The "Exploiting High Cooperation" rule is purely about maximizing personal gain when others have created a favorable environment. You are not contributing to maintain it; you are jumping on the bandwagon for a short-term boost.
*   **Punishing Defection (Implicitly):** While not explicitly programmed to punish every defection, the strategy's tendency to defect makes it a robust counter to widespread defection. If others defect, you defect. If they try to establish cooperation, you might join in *only if it benefits you directly and significantly*.
*   **Risk-Taking for Gain:** The rare "Exception" rule under persistent defection shows a willingness to take a calculated risk to potentially extract value. This is an aggressive gamble.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy does not forgive past defections. Its cooperation is solely based on the immediate potential for higher personal payoffs. It does not seek to build or maintain a cooperative equilibrium.

description_AGGRESSIVE_112 = '''
This is an excellent setup for a strategic thinking exercise! The N-Player Public Goods Game, especially in a repeated setting with imperfect information, presents a fascinating challenge. Given the "aggressive" requirement and the need for robustness, here's a strategy designed to maximize personal payoff while leveraging the game's structure.

## Strategy: The "Exploitative Maximizer"

This strategy is built on the principle that in a public goods game with $k < n$, individual defection is always the dominant strategy in a single round if you assume others will cooperate. However, in a repeated game, this can lead to a race to the bottom. The "Exploitative Maximizer" aims to *initiate* cooperation when it's most advantageous and *exploit* periods of widespread cooperation, but to defect aggressively when it detects the breakdown of cooperation or the presence of defectors.

The core idea is to be a "conditional cooperator" with a strong bias towards defecting and a proactive stance to punish defection. It's not about promoting general cooperation; it's about maximizing your payoff by riding the wave of others' cooperation and swiftly cutting losses when that wave recedes or when you can gain an advantage.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect will be based on a "Cooperation Threshold" and a "Defection Counter."

*   **Cooperation Threshold (T):** This is a dynamic value that represents the minimum number of perceived cooperators in the *previous* round required for the strategy to consider cooperating in the current round.

*   **Defection Counter (D_count):** This counter tracks the number of times the strategy has defected in consecutive rounds. It helps prevent premature defection against a consistently cooperative group and also serves as a mechanism to punish a sustained decrease in cooperation.

**Decision Logic:**

*   **If `D_count` > `threshold_for_aggressive_defection` (e.g., 2 or 3):**
    *   **Defect (D).** This is the core aggressive component. If the strategy has defected for a few rounds straight, it assumes cooperation has broken down and it's better to secure private gains. The `threshold_for_aggressive_defection` is a parameter that can be tuned; a lower value means faster aggression.

*   **Else if `total_cooperators_in_previous_round` < `Cooperation Threshold (T)`:**
    *   **Defect (D).** If the number of cooperators in the previous round falls below our threshold, we signal our dissatisfaction and protect our endowment.

*   **Else (if `total_cooperators_in_previous_round` ≥ `Cooperation Threshold (T)` AND `D_count` ≤ `threshold_for_aggressive_defection`):**
    *   **Cooperate (C).** This is the exploitative part. If enough others are cooperating, and we haven't been in a defection spiral, we contribute to gain our share of the public good.

**Updating `Cooperation Threshold (T)`:**

The `Cooperation Threshold` should be dynamic to adapt to changing group behavior.

*   **If `total_cooperators_in_previous_round` is high (e.g., ≥ n/2):**
    *   Increase `Cooperation Threshold (T)` slightly (e.g., by 1). This encourages a more sustained cooperative environment if it's already working, but with a slight bias towards only joining in when it's clearly beneficial.

*   **If `total_cooperators_in_previous_round` is moderate (e.g., between n/4 and n/2):**
    *   Keep `Cooperation Threshold (T)` the same.

*   **If `total_cooperators_in_previous_round` is low (e.g., < n/4):**
    *   Decrease `Cooperation Threshold (T)` slightly (e.g., by 1). This makes it easier to rejoin cooperation if others are struggling to maintain it, potentially preventing a complete collapse.

**Updating `D_count`:**

*   If the strategy Defects: Increment `D_count`.
*   If the strategy Cooperates: Reset `D_count` to 0.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C).** In the absence of any historical data, the "Exploitative Maximizer" starts by signaling willingness to cooperate. This is a calculated risk to *induce* cooperation and observe the group's initial reaction. The payoff in this round is $(k/n)$ if others also cooperate, or 1 if they defect. This is the best-case scenario for gathering information without immediate loss.
    *   **Initialization:** `D_count = 0`. `Cooperation Threshold (T)` can be initialized to a moderate value, say `floor(n/2)` or even `ceil(n/4)`.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D).** In the final round, there is no future to consider or reputation to maintain. The rational, aggressive choice is to secure the maximum private payoff by keeping the endowment. This is because any cooperation in this round yields no future benefits from others.

*   **Second to Last Round (t = r-1):**
    *   **Decision:** The strategy follows the standard decision rules. If cooperation is observed and beneficial, it might cooperate. If defection is prevalent, it will defect. The key is that its decision here is *not* directly influenced by the fact it's the second to last round, but by the game state as dictated by the primary rules. However, if it *does* cooperate in this round, and the game ends, it will have "lost" its endowment. The standard rules will naturally lead it to defect if it anticipates the final round's defection by others.

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained

*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** Cooperating in the first round isn't "passive"; it's an active attempt to create an environment where exploiting others' cooperation is possible. It's a probe to see if a beneficial cooperative norm can be established.
*   **Swift Punishment:** The `D_count` mechanism ensures that if cooperation falters, the strategy quickly switches to defection. It doesn't wait for a full breakdown; a few rounds of declining cooperation are enough to trigger a defensive, then offensive, defection.
*   **Exploitative Nature:** The strategy only cooperates when the number of observed cooperators exceeds its threshold. This means it's not a naive altruist; it only contributes when it expects to receive a return *greater* than its contribution through the public good mechanism. The threshold is designed to ensure that the sum of contributions from cooperators is sufficiently large to benefit everyone (including itself) compared to everyone defecting.
*   **Final Round Defection:** The unconditional defection in the last round is the ultimate aggressive move, ensuring no opportunity is missed for private gain when collective action no longer matters.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy has a limited capacity for "forgiveness." If cooperation breaks down, it takes a significant period of sustained cooperation to overcome the `D_count` and return to a cooperative stance. This makes it unforgiving to defectors.

    // This logic assumes we can observe all other players' actions from the previous round

            // Defect if cooperation level drops below our threshold
            return 'D'
        else:
            // Cooperate if enough others are cooperating and we're not in an aggressive defection cycle
            return 'C'

// Post-round update (after action is taken and outcome is known for round t)
function update_state(action_taken_this_round, observed_cooperators_in_this_round):

        D_count += 1
    else: // action_taken_this_round == 'C'
        D_count = 0

    // Update Cooperation_Threshold_T based on observed cooperators from THIS round (which will be previous round for next iteration)
    total_cooperators_in_previous_round = observed_cooperators_in_this_round

    if observed_cooperators_in_this_round >= floor(n/2):
        Cooperation_Threshold_T = min(n, Cooperation_Threshold_T + 1) // Cap at n

    total_cooperators_in_previous_round = 0
    D_count = 0
    Cooperation_Threshold_T = floor(n/2) // Re-initialize T for a fresh start
```

**Rationale for Parameters:**

*   `threshold_for_aggressive_defection = 3`: This provides a buffer. It means the strategy won't just defect for one round and then decide cooperation is impossible. It needs to see a trend of defection (or its own defection) for a few rounds to declare cooperation truly dead.
*   `Cooperation_Threshold_T = floor(n/2)`: This initial value means that, on average, the strategy wants to see at least half the players cooperating before it joins in. This is a safe starting point, aiming to benefit from significant cooperative efforts. It can be tuned lower (e.g., `ceil(n/4)`) to be more aggressive in trying to jumpstart cooperation, or higher (e.g., `n-1`) to be more cautious and only cooperate when near-universal cooperation is observed.

This "Exploitative Maximizer" strategy is designed to be robust by having clear rules for every situation, adapting its threshold based on group behavior, and aggressively punishing deviations from its preferred state of affairs (high cooperation that it can exploit). It's not about building trust; it's about playing the odds and securing the best possible outcome in a dynamic, often self-interested environment.

description_AGGRESSIVE_113 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting cooperative tendencies while being resilient to defection.

## Aggressive Exploiter Strategy

This strategy is named "Aggressive Exploiter" because its primary objective is to extract maximum value from the game by leveraging the potential for collective benefit while punishing deviations and exploiting sustained cooperation. It's designed to be adaptive, reacting to the observed behavior of others rather than adhering to rigid pre-programmed cooperation.

### Core Philosophy:

*   **Exploit Cooperation:** If others cooperate, it benefits you significantly. The strategy aims to maximize this benefit.
*   **Punish Defection:** If others defect, it's crucial to retaliate to avoid being exploited and to encourage future cooperation (even if indirectly).
*   **Maintain a High Baseline:** Even when defecting, the strategy ensures a minimal payoff to itself.
*   **Leverage Repeated Nature:** The knowledge of future rounds influences immediate decisions, especially in the later stages.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core decision-making revolves around a **"cooperation threshold"** and a **"punishment counter."**

*   **Cooperation Threshold (CT):** This is a dynamic variable that represents the minimum proportion of cooperators observed in the *previous round* that will trigger cooperation in the current round. Initially, this is set very low to encourage early exploration and exploitation.
*   **Punishment Counter (PC):** This counter tracks consecutive rounds where the player has defected due to perceived exploitation or the actions of others. It serves as a memory of negative past interactions.

**Decision Logic for Round *t*:**

1.  **Initial State (First few rounds, or when PC is high):** **DEFECT (D)**
    *   In the very first round, and for a few subsequent rounds to gauge the landscape, the strategy will defect. This is to avoid being an easy target and to establish a baseline payoff.
    *   If the Punishment Counter (PC) is high (meaning many recent defections by others or a general trend of low cooperation), the strategy will continue to defect.

2.  **Exploitative Cooperation Trigger:** **COOPERATE (C)**
    *   If the number of observed cooperators in the *previous round* ($N_C_{t-1}$) is greater than or equal to the current Cooperation Threshold ($CT$), then **COOPERATE (C)**.
    *   **Crucially, when cooperating, the strategy will NOT reset the Punishment Counter (PC) immediately.** This is to maintain leverage. The PC will only be affected by sustained cooperation from others.

3.  **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment (After observed behavior):**
    *   **If the player cooperated in round *t-1* and the total payoff received was less than the payoff they *would have received if everyone had defected* (i.e., they were exploited):**
        *   Increase the Cooperation Threshold ($CT$) significantly. This means future cooperation requires a much higher level of observed cooperation.
        *   Increment the Punishment Counter ($PC$).
    *   **If the player cooperated in round *t-1* and the total payoff received was *equal to or greater than* the payoff they would have received if everyone had defected:**
        *   *Slightly* decrease the Cooperation Threshold ($CT$). This signals a willingness to cooperate more readily if the current level of collective benefit is maintained or improved.
        *   If the Punishment Counter ($PC$) is greater than 0, *decrement* it. This indicates that the negative past is being "forgiven" due to positive current interactions.

4.  **Punishment Phase:** **DEFECT (D)**
    *   If the number of observed cooperators in the previous round ($N_C_{t-1}$) is *less than* the current Cooperation Threshold ($CT$), then **DEFECT (D)**.
    *   Increment the Punishment Counter ($PC$).

5.  **Strategic Retreat (When PC is very high):** If the Punishment Counter ($PC$) reaches a predefined high limit (e.g., `max_punishment_rounds`), the strategy might temporarily revert to a more cautious stance to avoid prolonged mutual defection and observe again. However, the core aggression remains.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** Always **DEFECT (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** No historical data. This is the safest option to secure a baseline payoff and observe initial player behavior. The Cooperation Threshold is set to its lowest initial value (e.g., 0 or 1 player), and the Punishment Counter is 0.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** Always **DEFECT (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In a repeated game, the last round is effectively a one-shot game. The incentive for future cooperation disappears. Therefore, defecting guarantees a payoff of 1 for the player, regardless of what others do. There's no strategic advantage in cooperating as there's no future to influence.

*   **Rounds with Low Player Count (if n is small or near the end of the tournament):** The strategy remains the same. The `k/n` ratio is a parameter of the game, and the strategy adapts to the observed dynamics within the current game parameters.

*   **When all players cooperate in the previous round:** The strategy will cooperate. However, it will *not* reset the punishment counter immediately. This is a key aggressive element – even in a positive state, it retains some memory of past negative interactions. The punishment counter will only decrease if the positive feedback loop (high cooperation and good payoffs) is sustained for a few rounds.

### 3. Aggressive Nature:

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy begins by defecting and only deviates to cooperation when a sufficiently high number of others cooperate. This is inherently aggressive, seeking to benefit from others' cooperation rather than initiating it.
*   **Exploitative Payoff Maximization:** When others cooperate, the strategy maximizes its gain. The payoff for cooperating when all cooperate is `2` (with `k/n=1/3`), which is the highest possible payoff per round. When others cooperate and the player defects, the payoff is `1 + (k/n) * N_C`, which can be higher than `1` (the payoff for defecting when all defect). The strategy aims to capture this "free rider" benefit whenever possible.
*   **Retaliatory Defection:** The aggressive nature is most apparent when the strategy detects exploitation. It immediately defects and increases the threshold, making future cooperation less likely. This is a clear signal of "no tolerance for being taken advantage of."
*   **"Forgiveness" with Conditions:** The strategy does not hold grudges indefinitely. The punishment counter can be reduced, and the threshold lowered, but only if there's consistent evidence of beneficial collective action. This is not altruism; it's strategic recalculation of expected future payoffs.

description_AGGRESSIVE_114 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize its own payoff while being adaptable and robust in a tournament setting. The core idea is to be a "punishing cooperater" – willing to cooperate to leverage the public good, but quick to defect and exploit if others do, and never forgiving.

## Aggressive Strategy: The "Opportunistic Retaliator"

This strategy aims to exploit the game's structure by initially seeking gains from cooperation, but with a strong bias towards defecting to secure private gains, especially when it anticipates others might defect. It prioritizes immediate gains over long-term, uncertain cooperation.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect is driven by a simple, yet aggressive, assessment of the current round's potential payoff compared to the guaranteed payoff of defecting.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   The default action is to defect. This ensures a baseline payoff of 1 in any given round, regardless of what others do. This is the most risk-averse and self-serving starting point.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: Cooperate (C) ONLY IF:**
    *   **"Mass Cooperation Potential":** The player believes that a significant majority of other players are likely to cooperate in the current round. Specifically, cooperation is considered *only if* the expected payoff from cooperating is *strictly greater* than the guaranteed payoff from defecting.

    Let's formalize this:
    *   Guaranteed payoff from Defecting (π_D): 1 (since the private endowment remains untouched).
    *   Expected payoff from Cooperating (π_C): This depends on the number of *other* players who cooperate. Since we don't know this precisely beforehand in a simultaneous game, we need a heuristic. The most aggressive heuristic is to assume that if we *choose* to cooperate, it will be *part of* a situation where many others *also* cooperate.

    **Decision Rule:** Player `i` plays **C** if and only if:
    **(k/n) * (estimated_total_cooperators) > 1**

    **How to estimate `estimated_total_cooperators`?**
    This is where the "aggressive" and "adaptive" nature comes in. We'll use history, but with a strong bias towards self-interest.

    *   **Initial Rounds (Heuristic):** In the very early rounds, the strategy uses a simple heuristic. It assumes cooperation is potentially beneficial if the `k/n` factor is high enough to make *even a modest number of cooperators* profitable. A conservative but aggressive threshold could be: **Cooperate if `k/n > 0.5` and there's at least one observed cooperator from the previous round among the majority of players.** This is a soft start, but quickly pivots.

    *   **History-Based Threshold:** As rounds progress, the strategy relies more heavily on observed behavior.
        *   Calculate the average cooperation rate in the *previous `R_lookback` rounds* (e.g., `R_lookback = min(r/2, 5)`).
        *   Let `avg_cooperation_rate` be this average.
        *   If `k/n * n * avg_cooperation_rate > 1`, then cooperation *might* be considered.
        *   **Crucially, for this aggressive strategy, we add a strict condition:** Cooperation is only chosen if the *number of observed cooperators in the *immediate previous round* (`c_{t-1}`) was *at least `n/2`* (a majority).
        *   **And, a punitive element:** If in the previous round, the total number of cooperators was less than `n/2` AND `k/n * total_cooperators_t-1 > 1` (meaning cooperation was *potentially* beneficial but didn't happen sufficiently), the strategy will defect for sure in the current round, even if the general `k/n` ratio suggests otherwise. It's punishing the lack of collective action.

*   **The "Punishing Retaliator" Logic:**
    *   If **total cooperators in round t-1 < n/2**: **Always Defect (D)** in round t. This player is unforgiving of insufficient collective effort.
    *   If **total cooperators in round t-1 >= n/2**:
        *   Calculate the payoff if player `i` were to cooperate *now*, assuming the *same* number of cooperators from round t-1 (excluding player i).
        *   Let `C_{t-1}` be the total cooperators in round t-1.
        *   If player `i` cooperates now, the new total would be `C_{t-1}` (if `i` was a defector in t-1) or `C_{t-1}-1` (if `i` was a cooperator in t-1).
        *   The payoff for player `i` from cooperating would be `(k/n) * (C_{t-1} if i was D, or C_{t-1}-1 if i was C)`.
        *   **If this payoff is strictly greater than 1 (the payoff from defecting), then Cooperate (C).**
        *   **Otherwise (if payoff <= 1), Defect (D).**

This logic can be summarized as: **Cooperate only if you can guarantee a personal payoff greater than 1 by doing so, and *only* if a majority of others cooperated in the previous round. Otherwise, defect.**

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Since there's no history, the strategy defaults to **Defect (D)**. This is the most aggressive, self-preserving stance. It allows the player to observe the landscape without risking an unprofitable cooperation.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   The strategy **always Defects (D)** in the last round. In a repeated game without future repercussions, the rational, self-interested choice is to maximize the payoff in the final round. There's no incentive to cooperate for future rounds.

*   **"Dead" Rounds (No History of Cooperation):**
    *   If there's been a prolonged period where the majority never cooperated (e.g., `n/2` cooperators never observed), the strategy will continue to defect. It's designed to not initiate cooperation if it hasn't seen evidence it will be reciprocated enough to be beneficial.

### 3. Aggressiveness Explained

*   **Default to Defect:** The core of the aggression is starting and mostly staying at defect. This secures a minimum payoff and avoids being exploited by a group of defectors.
*   **Conditional Cooperation, Not Trust:** Cooperation is *never* based on trust or an assumption of good intentions. It's a purely calculated move to extract value *only when* the math strongly favors it, and only when there's *observed evidence* that others are contributing enough to make it worthwhile (majority cooperation in the previous round).
*   **Punitive Nature:** The strategy punishes insufficient cooperation. If others don't contribute enough to reach the majority threshold, it becomes more hesitant to cooperate in the future, effectively punishing free-riders or those who didn't pull their weight.
*   **No Forgiveness:** This strategy does not "forgive" past defections or lack of cooperation. It only looks at the immediate preceding round for its decision to cooperate.
*   **Exploitation of High `k/n`:** If `k/n` is high enough to make cooperation consistently profitable for everyone, this strategy *will* cooperate, but *only* if it meets the majority threshold. It's not initiating cooperation proactively; it's joining a successful cooperative effort to maximize its own gain within that effort.

    return "D"

  // Rule 2: Calculate potential payoff from cooperating NOW
  // Assume current number of cooperators will be roughly similar to previous round,
  // adjusted for my own potential action.

  if player_was_cooperator_prev_round:
    // If I cooperated last round and others did too (majority), what happens if I cooperate NOW?
    // Total cooperators would be: total_cooperators_prev_round - 1 (because I switch from C to C)
    // But the logic is: if I decide to cooperate *this round*, what's my payoff?
    // Let's re-think the payoff calculation directly based on the DECISION.

    // If I choose C this round, what's my payoff? It depends on others' actions.
    // The most reliable estimate for others' actions is the PAST.
    // For aggression, we assume the MOST BENEFICIAL PAST scenario where majority cooperated.

    // Payoff if I cooperate this round, assuming previous round's cooperation pattern (for others)
    // If I was a cooperator last round: assume others still cooperate at the observed level.
    // My contribution would be 1 (if I cooperate). Total contributions for my calculation: total_cooperators_prev_round.
    // Payoff_if_I_Cooperate = (k / n) * total_cooperators_prev_round

    // If I defected last round: assume others still cooperate at the observed level.
    // My contribution would be 0 (if I cooperate). Total contributions for my calculation: total_cooperators_prev_round + 1.
    // Payoff_if_I_Cooperate = (k / n) * (total_cooperators_prev_round + 1) // This feels wrong.

    // The decision should be: IF I COOPERATE, what's MY payoff?
    // MY payoff depends on `c_i` (which is 1 if I C) and `sum(c_j)`.
    // For `sum(c_j)`, the most aggressive assumption is that the majority behavior from the previous round *persists for others*.

    // If I decide to COOPERATE this round:
    potential_total_cooperators_if_i_coop = 0
    if player_was_cooperator_prev_round:
        potential_total_cooperators_if_i_coop = total_cooperators_prev_round // Assume others continue at the observed level
    else:
        potential_total_cooperators_if_i_coop = total_cooperators_prev_round + 1 // Assume others continue + I join


    // Recalculate payoff if I decide to COOPERATE in *this* round
    // The number of cooperators *excluding myself* is the crucial part for my payoff if I contribute.
    // We can simplify: If I cooperate, my payoff is (k/n) * (1 + # of other cooperators).
    // The number of other cooperators is best estimated by the number of cooperators in the previous round.
    // However, if I was a defector last round, and I'm considering cooperating now, the total cooperators will be the previous total PLUS me.

    // Let's make it simpler and more aggressive:
    // If I cooperate, my payoff is guaranteed to be at least (k/n) * (1 + some_estimate_of_others_cooperating).
    // The most aggressive assumption is that if I *do* cooperate, others will continue to cooperate at a level that makes it worthwhile for me.
    // We already checked majority cooperation in the previous round.
    // So, if majority cooperated in the previous round:
    // My payoff from COOPERATING = (k / n) * (total_cooperators_prev_round)  -- This assumes I'm part of the group that cooperated.
    // This implies if I was a defector, I would still contribute 1 and add to the count.
    // This interpretation is difficult because it's simultaneous.

    // Let's use the example calculations as a guide:
    // π_i = (1 - c_i) + (k/n) × Σ(j=1 to n) c_j
    // If player i plays C: π_i = 0 + (k/n) × (1 + # of other cooperators)
    // If player i plays D: π_i = 1 + (k/n) × (# of other cooperators)

    // We need to estimate "# of other cooperators" in the current round.
    // The most aggressive and adaptive estimate: use the previous round's *total* cooperators, as it represents a stable (or recent) state of cooperation for the "group".
    // However, we must consider my own action.

    // Let C_est = total_cooperators_prev_round if player_was_cooperator_prev_round else total_cooperators_prev_round + 1
    // This C_est represents the 'baseline' cooperation level from others.
    // This is also tricky.

    // Simpler, truly aggressive rule based on payoff:
    // IF I COOPERATE, MY PAYOFF WILL BE: (k/n) * (1 + number of OTHER players who cooperate).
    // IF I DEFECT, MY PAYOFF WILL BE: 1 + (k/n) * (number of OTHER players who cooperate).

    // Estimate "number of OTHER players who cooperate":
    // This is where history is used. The most recent stable state is the previous round's total cooperators.
    // Let's assume that the number of cooperators in the current round *excluding myself* will be roughly `total_cooperators_prev_round`.
    // This is an aggressive assumption as it doesn't penalize others for my own potential switch from D to C.

    estimated_other_cooperators = total_cooperators_prev_round // This is the KEY aggressive assumption.

    // Calculate payoff if I COOPERATE
    payoff_if_cooperate = (k / n) * (1 + estimated_other_cooperators)

    // Calculate payoff if I DEFECT
    payoff_if_defect = 1 + (k / n) * estimated_other_cooperators

    // Decision: Cooperate ONLY IF it yields STRICTLY MORE than defecting.
    if payoff_if_cooperate > payoff_if_defect:
      return "C"
    else:
      return "D"

  else: // This should not be reached if Rule 1 is applied correctly, but as a fallback:

## Strategy: The "Aggressor's Reckoning"

This strategy is designed for an aggressive player in the N-Player Public Goods Game. It prioritizes maximizing individual gains while being willing to exploit cooperators and punish defectors, but only after a certain threshold of trust has been broken. The core idea is to be a "conditional cooperator" but with a very low tolerance for being taken advantage of, and a strong inclination to retaliate.

**Aggressive Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Exploitation:** The strategy will leverage opportunities to defect when it is individually beneficial, especially if it senses a lack of collective cooperation.
*   **Deterrence:** It aims to deter others from defecting by making them fear the consequences of widespread defection.
*   **Retaliation:** When betrayed, it will not hesitate to punish, but this punishment will be strategic and aimed at restoring a perceived "fairness" or advantage.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is based on a dynamic assessment of the current game state, influenced by past player behavior.

**Core Logic:**

*   **Default to Defection (Aggressive Baseline):** The primary inclination is to defect. Cooperation is a concession, not an expectation.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Cooperate *only if* the collective benefit of cooperation is demonstrably high *and* there's a strong indication that others are also cooperating or are likely to cooperate.
*   **Threshold for Trust:** A certain level of collective cooperation is required to overcome the default tendency to defect.
*   **Punishment Trigger:** If the strategy is "betrayed" (i.e., it cooperates and others defect), it will escalate to sustained defection.

**Detailed Decision Rules:**

1.  **Initial Phase (Early Rounds):**
    *   **Round 1:** **Defect (D).** This establishes an aggressive stance immediately and tests the waters. It's about asserting dominance and observing reactions without showing weakness.
    *   **Rounds 2 to `early_phase_end` (e.g., min(r/4, 5)):**
        *   **Calculate the "Cooperation Ratio" (CR) from the previous round:** `CR = (Number of Cooperators in previous round) / n`
        *   **If `CR` is above a certain high threshold (e.g., `0.7`) AND the "Aggressor's Payoff" (`π_i` when playing C) is significantly better than the "Defector's Payoff" (`π_i` when playing D):** **Cooperate (C).** This is a calculated cooperation, driven by a strong belief that others are also cooperating and that collective action is truly beneficial *and* safe.
        *   **Otherwise:** **Defect (D).** This maintains the aggressive default.

2.  **Mid-Game Phase (Building Pressure/Observing Trends):**
    *   **For rounds after `early_phase_end` and before `late_phase_start`:**
        *   **Calculate the "Cooperation Ratio" (CR) from the previous round.**
        *   **Check for Betrayal:** Has the Aggressor been exploited in the previous round?
            *   If the Aggressor played **C** in the previous round, and the `CR` was **below a moderate threshold (e.g., `0.5`)**: **Defect (D).** This signifies being taken advantage of.
        *   **If no Betrayal:**
            *   **If `CR` is above a high threshold (e.g., `0.7`):** **Cooperate (C).** Continue to leverage a perceived cooperative environment, but with cautious optimism.
            *   **If `CR` is above a moderate threshold (e.g., `0.5`) but below the high threshold:** **Defect (D).** This is a strategic defection to gain an advantage from a mixed environment. It's not pure exploitation, but rather capitalizing on less than full cooperation.
            *   **If `CR` is below the moderate threshold:** **Defect (D).** This is the aggressive default, reinforced by a lack of collective effort.

3.  **Late Game Phase (Maximizing Gains/Final Push):**
    *   **For rounds `late_phase_start` to `r`:**
        *   **Focus on maximizing individual payoff.** The primary goal shifts to securing the highest possible total score, even if it means sacrificing potential long-term collective benefits.
        *   **Calculate the "Cooperation Ratio" (CR) from the previous round.**
        *   **Check for Betrayal:** If the Aggressor played **C** in the previous round, and the `CR` was **below a high threshold (e.g., `0.6`)**: **Defect (D).** Even in the late game, betrayal is not tolerated and triggers punishment.
        *   **If no Betrayal:**
            *   **If `CR` is high (e.g., `0.8` or above) AND the "Aggressor's Payoff" (`π_i` when playing C) is significantly better than the "Defector's Payoff" (`π_i` when playing D):** **Cooperate (C).** This is a rare, highly calculated cooperation when the stars align for maximum collective gain.
            *   **Otherwise:** **Defect (D).** The aggressive default takes over, aiming to extract as much as possible from any remaining cooperators or the collective pool.

**Key Thresholds (These would be tuned based on tournament performance, but for initial design):**

*   `early_phase_end`: `min(r/4, 5)` (The first 25% of rounds, capped at 5)
*   `late_phase_start`: `max(r - 5, r/2)` (The last 5 rounds, or the second half of rounds, whichever is larger)
*   High Cooperation Threshold: `0.7` (or `0.8` in late game)
*   Moderate Cooperation Threshold: `0.5`

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):** **Always Defect (D).** This is the cornerstone of the aggressive stance. It's a declaration of intent, a test of opponents, and prevents immediate exploitation.
*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Always Defect (D).** There are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation. The sole objective is to maximize the final payoff for the Aggressor. This is the ultimate aggressive move, leaving no room for sentimentality or future considerations.
*   **Early Rounds (t=2 to `early_phase_end`):** As described in Decision Rules, this is a period of observation and conditional cooperation, heavily weighted towards defection.
*   **Rounds where `n` is small (e.g., `n=2`):** The strategy is inherently robust to smaller `n`. The ratios and thresholds still apply, but the impact of each player's decision is amplified. If `n=2` and the Aggressor defects, they get `1`. If the other player cooperates, they get `1 + k/2`. If both cooperate, both get `k/2`. The strategy's default to defect in `n=2` makes it likely to win against a lone cooperator, and if the other player also defects, it's a mutual defection with predictable payoffs.
*   **Rounds where `k` is close to `n`:** This scenario makes cooperation much more appealing. However, the Aggressor's Reckoning strategy will still be cautious. It will require a consistently high `CR` to engage in cooperation. The "Aggressor's Payoff" will be compared against the "Defector's Payoff" more critically. If `k` is very close to `n`, the benefit of cooperation will be more easily demonstrated, but the *risk* of being the sole cooperator against many defectors is still a major concern, leading to a default to defection unless clear evidence of widespread cooperation exists.
*   **Rounds where `k` is close to 1:** This makes cooperation less beneficial. The strategy will be even more inclined to defect, as the incentives for collective action are weaker. The thresholds for cooperation will be harder to meet.

---

### 3. Aggressive Nature Explained

*   **"No Free Lunches":** The strategy assumes others will try to exploit it. It starts by defecting to avoid being the easy target.
*   **"Punishment for Betrayal":** The core of the aggression lies in the response to being exploited. If the Aggressor cooperates and others defect, it immediately retaliates with sustained defection. This isn't about forgiveness; it's about making defection costly for others.
*   **"Calculated Exploitation":** In mid-game, if cooperation is not universally high, the strategy will defect to gain an individual advantage. This is not malicious, but a rational pursuit of self-interest in a less-than-ideal cooperative environment.
*   **"Last Stand Aggression":** The final round is pure self-interest maximization. There's no reason to be a "good sport" when there are no future consequences.
*   **"High Bar for Cooperation":** Cooperation is not a default. It requires a strong signal from the group that widespread cooperation is happening and beneficial. This prevents the strategy from being easily manipulated by a few initial cooperators.

## Aggressive Public Goods Game Strategy: "The Opportunistic Predator"

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting the inherent incentive to defect in the Public Goods Game, while remaining adaptive to changing group dynamics. It prioritizes immediate gains but possesses a mechanism to punish persistent defection and retaliate when advantageous.

**Core Philosophy:** "Every player is a potential exploiter, and every round is an opportunity for gain. I will be the first to exploit, but I will not tolerate being exploited repeatedly without consequence."

### 1. Decision Rules

The core of "The Opportunistic Predator" strategy revolves around a dynamic assessment of the current round's perceived "cooperation level" and a threshold for triggering aggressive defection.

**Decision Logic:**

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   The baseline action for "The Opportunistic Predator" is to defect. This maximizes individual payoff in any given round, as the private benefit of keeping the endowment (1) is always greater than the private payoff from contributing when `k < n` (which is `(k/n)`). The only exception is when everyone else cooperates, in which case contributing is marginally better (2 vs 1).

*   **Trigger for Cooperation: Perceived "Cooperation Threshold" Met**
    *   "The Opportunistic Predator" will *temporarily* cooperate only if it believes that a sufficient number of other players are also cooperating to make cooperation individually beneficial *or* if it's a strategic move to induce future cooperation.
    *   **The "Cooperation Threshold" (C_T):** This threshold is calculated dynamically based on the game parameters `n` and `k`, and the observed history of cooperation.
        *   **Initial C_T (Round 1):** `C_T = ceil(n * (1 - k/n))`
            *   *Rationale:* This is the minimum number of cooperators required for a defector to receive a payoff *less than or equal to* what a cooperator receives if everyone else cooperates. If fewer than this number cooperate, defecting is always strictly better.
        *   **Adaptive C_T (Rounds t > 1):** `C_T = max(1, floor(n * (1 - k/n) * (average_cooperation_rate_in_past_rounds + 0.1)))`
            *   *Rationale:* This adaptation is crucial. If the group has a history of high cooperation, "The Opportunistic Predator" becomes slightly more optimistic, lowering the threshold for its own cooperation. The `+ 0.1` adds a small buffer to encourage its own cooperation when the group is generally cooperative, but it's still a mild incentive as the strategy prioritizes aggression. The `max(1, ...)` ensures the threshold doesn't become unrealistically low.

    *   **Cooperate if `total_cooperators_observed_in_round_t-1 >= C_T`**
        *   *Rationale:* If the previous round (or the initial assessment of the group) indicates a significant level of cooperation, "The Opportunistic Predator" might join in to share in the higher collective payoff. This is a calculated risk to potentially benefit from a more cooperative environment, or to appear less threatening initially to influence future behavior.

*   **Punishment for Defection: The "Retaliation Trigger" (R_T)**
    *   If "The Opportunistic Predator" has *cooperated* in the previous round, and observes that the total number of cooperators in that round was *less than* the `C_T` it used to make its decision (meaning it was exploited), it will immediately trigger a retaliation.
    *   **Retaliation Trigger:** If `player_i_cooperated_in_t-1` AND `total_cooperators_observed_in_round_t-1 < C_T_used_for_t-1`, then `R_T = True`.
    *   **Decision when `R_T` is True: Always Defect (D)**
        *   *Rationale:* This is the aggressive core. If the strategy has been generous and the group hasn't reciprocated proportionally, it will immediately revert to maximum personal gain and punish the perceived exploitation. This also serves as a strong signal to other players that exploiting this strategy is costly.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the first round, there is no history. The "Opportunistic Predator" assumes the worst-case scenario for itself and aims for immediate maximal gain. The `C_T` is calculated using the initial formula, but it's not used for cooperation in round 1. The primary goal is to observe and learn.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future consequences. The incentive for cooperation disappears entirely. "The Opportunistic Predator" ensures it maximizes its payoff in the last opportunity.

*   **All Players are the Same Strategy (Hypothetical):**
    *   If all players are "The Opportunistic Predator," round 1 will be all D. In subsequent rounds, `C_T` will adjust upwards as cooperation rates appear low (because everyone defects). This will likely lead to a perpetual state of defection, with occasional, brief flirtations with cooperation that are quickly punished by other "Opportunistic Predators."

*   **Group with High Cooperation Rate (Early Rounds):**
    *   If the group consistently cooperates above the `C_T`, "The Opportunistic Predator" will eventually start cooperating. However, it will still be highly sensitive to any dips. If the cooperation rate drops below its `C_T`, it will immediately switch to Defect and potentially remain there for a while to "teach a lesson."

### 3. Aggressive Mindset

The "Opportunistic Predator" embodies aggression through:

*   **Default to Defection:** It always starts by prioritizing its own gain. Cooperation is an exception, not a rule.
*   **Immediate Exploitation:** If an opportunity for higher personal gain through defection exists, it takes it.
*   **Swift Retaliation:** It does not tolerate being exploited. If it cooperates and is met with insufficient cooperation, it immediately punishes and seeks maximum personal gain in subsequent rounds.
*   **Learning to Exploit Better:** Its adaptive `C_T` means it can become *more* aggressive if the group is consistently uncooperative, or slightly more inclined to "play along" if the group is demonstrably cooperative, but always with a keen eye for the opportune moment to defect.
*   **No Forgiveness:** While it adapts its `C_T`, there's no explicit forgiveness mechanism. A period of defection following exploitation is the natural consequence, and it will only return to considering cooperation if the group's behavior *proves* to be consistently beneficial to it.

description_AGGRESSIVE_117 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff while leveraging the repeated nature of the game and assuming no inherent player altruism. The core idea is to exploit periods of cooperation for personal gain and retaliate swiftly and decisively against defections.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploitative Retaliator"

This strategy aims to be the ultimate beneficiary in every round. It will cooperate only when it guarantees the highest individual payoff or when absolutely necessary to avoid immediate, significant losses due to widespread defection. Otherwise, it defects to maximize its private endowment.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to cooperate or defect is primarily driven by a calculation of immediate self-interest, tempered by a swift and unforgiving retaliation mechanism.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   The overwhelming default action for this strategy is to **Defect (D)**. This ensures the player always keeps their endowment of 1.
*   **Conditional Cooperation: Only when it's demonstrably more profitable than defecting.**
    *   This strategy will *only* consider cooperating if the expected payoff from cooperating is *strictly greater* than the payoff from defecting in that specific round.
    *   **Calculating Expected Payoff of Cooperating:**
        *   To cooperate, player `i` needs to estimate the number of other players `(n-1)` who will also cooperate. Let's call this `estimated_other_cooperators`.
        *   The payoff if `i` cooperates is: `π_i(C) = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * (1 + estimated_other_cooperators) = (k/n) * (1 + estimated_other_cooperators)`
    *   **Calculating Payoff of Defecting:**
        *   The payoff if `i` defects is: `π_i(D) = (1 - 0) + (k/n) * (0 + estimated_total_cooperators) = 1 + (k/n) * estimated_total_cooperators`
        *   Where `estimated_total_cooperators` is the player's estimate of the total number of cooperators (including themselves if they were to cooperate).
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   If `π_i(C) > π_i(D)`: **Cooperate (C)**. This is a rare condition and only occurs when `k/n` is sufficiently high and a large number of other players are expected to cooperate.
        *   If `π_i(C) <= π_i(D)`: **Defect (D)**. This will be the vast majority of cases.

*   **Retaliation Mechanism: Immediate and Severe**
    *   This strategy is designed to punish any perceived deviation from its "optimal" strategy (which is usually defection).
    *   **Trigger for Retaliation:** If *any* other player has defected in the *previous round*, and this strategy cooperated in that previous round:
        *   This strategy will **immediately switch to Defect (D)** for the *next r-1 rounds* (or until the end of the game).
    *   **Rationale:** This is a "grim trigger" but with an aggressive, self-serving twist. It cooperates only if the math strongly dictates it's *better* than defecting. If it cooperates and gets "punished" by a defector, it views this as an unacceptable exploitation and will refuse to be exploited again by defecting itself for the remainder of the game.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   Since there is no history, the strategy cannot predict opponent behavior based on past actions.
    *   In this scenario, it will fall back to the default calculation: **Defect (D)**. It's the safest bet to secure the private endowment and observe the landscape. It does not attempt to initiate cooperation.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   In the last round, the incentive structure changes dramatically. There are no future rounds to leverage for cooperation or to punish defections. The game becomes a one-shot game.
    *   Therefore, in the last round, the strategy will **always Defect (D)**, regardless of past history or expected behavior. This is the purely rational, egoistic choice in a finitely repeated game.

*   **All Opponents Cooperate (Hypothetical):**
    *   If, hypothetically, the strategy calculates that *all* other `(n-1)` players will cooperate, its payoff for cooperating would be `(k/n) * n = k`. Its payoff for defecting would be `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`.
    *   If `k > 1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`, it will cooperate. This inequality simplifies to `k > n - k + k`, which means `k > k`. This is impossible.
    *   Therefore, even if all other players cooperate, this strategy will still defect because `k` will never be strictly greater than `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)` given the game parameters `1 < k < n`. It will always be more profitable to defect. This underscores its aggressive, exploitative nature.

*   **What if the strategy's own calculation leads to a loss if it cooperates?**
    *   For example, if the strategy calculates it *should* cooperate based on its prediction, but its prediction is wrong and only 1 other player cooperates.
    *   If player `i` cooperates and `C_total = 2`: `π_i(C) = (k/n) * 2`
    *   If player `i` defects and `C_total = 1`: `π_i(D) = 1 + (k/n) * 1`
    *   If `(k/n) * 2 <= 1 + (k/n)`, i.e., `(k/n) <= 1`, then defecting is better. Since `k < n`, `k/n < 1`, so defecting is always better in this scenario.
    *   This reinforces that the strategy's conditional cooperation is only triggered when it's *provably* better than defecting, even with pessimistic assumptions about other players.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

This strategy is aggressive in the following ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** It prioritizes its own immediate gain (keeping the endowment) by default. Cooperation is a rare exception, only undertaken when it can demonstrably extract more than by defecting.
*   **Exploitative:** When it does cooperate, it's not out of altruism but because the numbers show it will profit *more* than others, given the collective contribution. It's trying to get the highest possible share of the public good while others are contributing.
*   **Unforgiving Retaliation:** The "grim trigger" on cooperation (if it cooperates and is "betrayed" by a defector) is immediate and absolute for the rest of the game. This signals a strong unwillingness to be taken advantage of and aims to punish those who deviate from its expected behavior.
*   **No Trust, No Forgiveness:** It doesn't attempt to build trust or forgiveness. It operates on a pure self-interest calculation combined with a swift punishment for perceived exploitation.
*   **Focus on Individual Payoff:** The strategy's sole objective is to maximize its own payoff, not to achieve some collectively optimal outcome.

### Pseudocode (Conceptual)

```
strategy("Exploitative Retaliator") {

  // Parameters
  n = number_of_players
  k = multiplication_factor
  r = number_of_rounds
  current_round = get_current_round()
  history = get_game_history() // List of past actions for all players

  // --- Decision Logic ---

  // Always defect in the last round
  if (current_round == r) {
    return "D";
  }

  // Default: Defect
  action = "D";
  my_payoff_if_defect = 1; // Keeping endowment

  // --- Conditional Cooperation Check ---
  // Only consider cooperating if it's strictly more profitable than defecting.
  // This requires predicting others' behavior, which is hard without communication.
  // For simplicity in this aggressive strategy, we can make a pessimistic prediction:
  // Assume a moderate number of cooperators (e.g., 0, 1, or a small percentage of n)
  // OR, if we want to be truly aggressive, we can ONLY cooperate if the expected payoff is GUARANTEED to be higher,
  // which requires knowing the exact number of other cooperators.

  // More realistic aggressive calculation:
  // What is the minimum number of *other* cooperators needed for me to benefit from cooperating?
  // Let C_others = number of other cooperators.
  // Payoff if I cooperate: (k/n) * (1 + C_others)
  // Payoff if I defect: 1 + (k/n) * C_others
  // I cooperate if (k/n) * (1 + C_others) > 1 + (k/n) * C_others
  // k/n + (k/n)*C_others > 1 + (k/n)*C_others
  // k/n > 1
  // This inequality (k/n > 1) is NEVER true given the game parameters (k < n).
  // This means it is NEVER strictly more profitable for me to cooperate than defect IF I assume others will defect or cooperate at a low rate.

  // The only way conditional cooperation becomes possible is if we are NEARLY SURE that
  // a large number of others will cooperate.
  // Let's simplify this: This strategy will *never* try to initiate cooperation unless
  // it has observed a very high level of cooperation from others in the *previous* round,
  // and the conditions still strongly favor cooperation.

  // --- Retaliation Logic ---
  // Check if anyone defected against me in the last round (if I cooperated).
  // Note: This strategy DEFAULTS to defect. It only cooperates under very specific conditions.
  // So, this retaliation only triggers if the strategy *did* cooperate in the previous round.
  if (current_round > 1) {
    last_round_actions = history[current_round - 1]; // Actions from previous round
    my_last_action = last_round_actions[my_player_index]; // My action in previous round

    if (my_last_action == "C") {
      // I cooperated in the last round. Did anyone defect?
      // If *any* other player defected in the last round, and I cooperated:
      for (player_index from 1 to n) {
        if (player_index != my_player_index) {
          if (last_round_actions[player_index] == "D") {
            // Betrayal detected! Defect for the rest of the game.
            // This is an aggressive, unforgiving response.
            return "D"; // Permanently defect
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // --- Default/No Strong Reason to Cooperate ---
  // If not in last round, and no retaliation triggered, and no compelling reason to cooperate
  // (which is almost always the case for this strategy), defect.
  return "D";
}
```

**Important Note on the Pseudocode:** The pseudocode is simplified. A true implementation would need a robust way to estimate opponent behavior for conditional cooperation. However, the core aggressive philosophy of "Exploitative Retaliator" is that it *rarely* tries to cooperate because the conditions for it to be strictly more profitable than defecting are extremely difficult to meet given `k < n`. Its primary defense against being exploited is to defect, and its secondary, aggressive defense is immediate, permanent retaliation if it *does* attempt cooperation and gets "punished." This strategy is designed to win by taking, not by sharing.

description_AGGRESSIVE_118 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff while acknowledging the repeated nature of the game and the presence of other strategic agents.

## Strategy: "Exploitative Retaliator"

This strategy aims to extract as much private gain as possible, punishing any deviation from a desired norm (which is, essentially, the other players cooperating). It's "aggressive" because it prioritizes its own immediate gain and is quick to punish perceived exploitation.

### Core Philosophy:

1.  **Maximize Private Gain:** Always take the opportunity to defect when it offers a personal advantage.
2.  **Punish Non-Cooperation:** If others defect, retaliate to discourage future exploitation and to signal displeasure.
3.  **Exploit Cooperation:** If others cooperate, leverage their altruism to increase your own payoff.
4.  **Adaptive, but Firm:** The strategy adapts based on observed behavior but maintains a strong stance against exploitation.

### Decision Rules:

Let's define the state of the game at the beginning of each round `t` (where `t` ranges from 1 to `r`).

*   **`N_cooperators_t-1`**: The number of players who cooperated in the *previous* round (`t-1`).
*   **`My_action_t-1`**: Your action in the previous round (`t-1`).
*   **`Opponent_actions_t-1`**: A record of all other players' actions in the previous round.

**Decision Rule for Round `t`:**

1.  **Early Rounds (rounds 1 to `r`/4, approximately):**
    *   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` > `n`/2 (Majority Cooperation):** **Cooperate (C)**. This is a strategic probing phase. If the majority is cooperating, it suggests a stable cooperative environment where you can benefit. By cooperating, you contribute to this stability and gain the higher payoff from collective action.
    *   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` ≤ `n`/2 (Majority Defection or Split):** **Defect (D)**. If the group is not strongly leaning towards cooperation, it's safer and more profitable to defect. There's no benefit to being the sole cooperator in a group that's mostly defecting, and you can still extract your endowment.

2.  **Mid-Game Rounds (rounds `r`/4 + 1 to `3r`/4, approximately):**
    *   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` == `n` (All Cooperated Last Round):** **Cooperate (C)**. Continue to foster the cooperative environment, as it's maximally beneficial when everyone is on board.
    *   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` > `n`/2 (Majority Cooperation Last Round):** **Cooperate (C)**. Maintain cooperation as long as the majority is cooperating. This signals you are willing to cooperate in a predominantly cooperative group.
    *   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` < `n` AND `N_cooperators_t-1` > 0 (Some Cooperation, but not a strong majority):** **Defect (D)**. This is where the "aggressive" nature kicks in. You are not getting the full benefit of universal cooperation, and you are seeing others exploit. Punish this by defecting to claim your full endowment. This also discourages them from continuing to defect when you are cooperating.
    *   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` == 0 (No Cooperation Last Round):** **Defect (D)**. If everyone defected last round, there's no incentive to cooperate. Defect to maximize your private gain.

3.  **Late Rounds (rounds `3r`/4 + 1 to `r-1`):**
    *   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` == `n` (All Cooperated Last Round):** **Cooperate (C)**. Try to end the game on a high note if cooperation was universal.
    *   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` > 0 (At least one cooperator, including yourself):** **Cooperate (C)**. In the late stages, with fewer rounds remaining, there's a stronger incentive to ensure the group project generates value, as the risk of being exploited in the final round is lower than the potential gain from a cooperative outcome. However, this is where the strategy becomes slightly less "aggressive" and more opportunistic to secure a good final score if cooperation is even partially present.
    *   **If `N_cooperators_t-1` == 0 (No Cooperation Last Round):** **Defect (D)**. If the group has devolved into universal defection, continue to exploit.

4.  **Final Round (round `r`):**
    *   **Always Defect (D)**. In the absolute final round, there is no future to consider, and no need to reciprocate or establish norms. The only rational action is to maximize your immediate payoff by keeping your endowment.

### Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1:**
    *   Since there is no history, the strategy must default to a reasonable starting assumption. We assume a moderate level of cooperation is a good initial probe.
    *   **Decision:** **Cooperate (C)**. This is a "generous" start, hoping to trigger mutual cooperation. If others defect, the later rounds will compensate.

*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   As specified above, **Always Defect (D)**. This is purely to maximize individual score in the final moment.

*   **Parameters `k` and `n`:**
    *   The thresholds (`n`/2) implicitly use `n`.
    *   The parameter `k` is not directly used in the decision logic. This is because the "aggressiveness" is driven by the *observed actions of others* and their deviation from universal cooperation, rather than a direct calculation of whether cooperation is individually profitable *in theory*. The strategy assumes that if others are cooperating, it's likely profitable for the group (and thus for the individual). The core is about reacting to observed behavior.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```pseudocode
strategy "Exploitative Retaliator":

parameters: n, r, k

history = empty_list // Stores a record of all players' actions for each past round

function decide_action(current_round, history, my_player_index):
  if current_round == 1:
    return C // Start with cooperation to probe

  last_round_actions = history[current_round - 2] // Actions from the previous round (history is 0-indexed, rounds are 1-indexed)
  my_last_action = last_round_actions[my_player_index]
  num_cooperators_last_round = count_cooperators(last_round_actions)

  // --- Decision Logic ---

  if current_round == r: // Final Round
    return D

  if current_round <= r / 4: // Early Rounds
    if num_cooperators_last_round > n / 2:
      return C
    else:
      return D

  elif current_round <= 3 * r / 4: // Mid-Game Rounds
    if num_cooperators_last_round == n:
      return C
    elif num_cooperators_last_round > n / 2:
      return C
    elif num_cooperators_last_round > 0: // Some cooperation, but not strong majority
      return D
    else: // num_cooperators_last_round == 0
      return D

  else: // Late Rounds (current_round > 3*r/4 and < r)
    if num_cooperators_last_round == n:
      return C
    elif num_cooperators_last_round > 0:
      return C
    else: // num_cooperators_last_round == 0
      return D

// Helper function
function count_cooperators(actions_list):
  count = 0
  for action in actions_list:
    if action == C:
      count = count + 1
  return count
```

### Aggressiveness Justification:

1.  **Quick to Punish:** The strategy defects as soon as the majority cooperation threshold is not met in early and mid-game rounds. This immediately prioritizes personal gain over group benefit if the group isn't demonstrating strong cooperation.
2.  **Exploiting Majority Cooperation:** In early rounds, it capitalizes on situations where others are cooperating (if the majority does), ensuring it gets the higher payoff.
3.  **No Long-Term Forgiveness:** Unlike tit-for-tat in a 2-player game, this strategy doesn't "forgive" single defections from a majority. If the group deviates from universal cooperation, it shifts to defecting to maximize its own gain. It only cooperates if the group demonstrates a strong or universal commitment to it.
4.  **Final Round Selfishness:** The absolute defection in the final round is a hallmark of pure self-interest, aiming to extract every last point.

This strategy aims to be a formidable opponent by being opportunistic, retaliatory, and ultimately, selfish in its pursuit of the highest possible score. It relies on the game's structure to punish non-cooperation and exploit cooperative environments.

This aggressive strategy is designed to maximize your payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game, prioritizing individual gain while being acutely aware of the collective dynamics. It's built on a foundation of immediate self-interest, but with a keen eye for exploiting opportunities and punishing deviations that harm you. The core idea is to be a "retaliatory cooperator" or an "opportunistic defector" depending on the circumstances, always aiming to be the one benefiting most.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploiter-Retaliator"

This strategy operates on the principle of **"benefit yourself first, retaliate when harmed, and leverage cooperation only when it's demonstrably more profitable for *you*."**

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round is primarily driven by the perceived profitability of cooperation and a history of being exploited.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   Your baseline is to defect. This ensures you always secure your endowment (1 unit of payoff) in any round. You only deviate from this default if there's a compelling reason based on the following conditions.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: Cooperate (C) IF:**
    *   **The "Cooperation Advantage" is Significant:** You will consider cooperating only if the expected immediate payoff from cooperating is *strictly greater* than the payoff from defecting, given the current observed behavior of other players.
        *   **Formula for evaluating cooperation:**
            *   If you play C, your payoff will be: `(k/n) * (total_cooperators_observed_so_far_including_you + 1)`
            *   If you play D, your payoff will be: `1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_observed_so_far)`
        *   **Decision:** You will play C if and only if `(k/n) * (total_cooperators_observed_so_far + 1)` > `1 + (k/n) * (total_cooperators_observed_so_far)`. This simplifies to `k/n > 1`. **However, the game specification states `1 < k < n`, which means `k/n` is always greater than 1/n and less than 1.** This means the *marginal* benefit of your own cooperation is always positive but potentially offset by others defecting.
        *   **Revised Cooperation Trigger:** You will cooperate if the *estimated total payoff* from a round where *you* cooperate, based on observed cooperation levels of others, is *significantly higher* than the estimated payoff from a round where *you* defect.
            *   **Let `O` be the number of players you *expect* to cooperate in this round (excluding yourself).** You can estimate `O` based on the average cooperation rate in recent rounds or the majority behavior.
            *   **Your payoff if you C:** `(k/n) * (O + 1)`
            *   **Your payoff if you D:** `1 + (k/n) * O`
            *   **Cooperate if:** `(k/n) * (O + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * O`. This simplifies to `k/n > 1`. As noted, this condition is always met in terms of the marginal contribution, but the *net* benefit depends on `O`.
            *   **More practically: You will cooperate if the expected payoff from cooperation *for you* is at least `X` units higher than defecting, where `X` is a small, positive threshold.** For aggression, let's set this threshold low, e.g., `X = 0.1`.
            *   **Therefore, you Cooperate if `(k/n) * (O + 1) - (1 + (k/n) * O) > 0.1`**. This means `k/n - 1 > 0.1`. This is unlikely given `k < n`.
            *   **Correct Interpretation for Aggression:** The payoff calculation is key. You get 1 unit regardless of your action if others defect. If others cooperate, your payoff increases significantly. The decision to cooperate is about whether the *potential collective payoff* is worth your initial investment.
            *   **Aggressive Cooperation Trigger:** You will cooperate *only if* the number of observed cooperators in the *previous round* (`C_prev`) plus your own cooperation would lead to a payoff for *you* that is at least `Y` (a small positive value, e.g., `0.5`) greater than defecting.
                *   Payoff if you C: `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1)`
                *   Payoff if you D: `1 + (k/n) * C_prev`
                *   **Cooperate if:** `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * C_prev + Y`
                *   This simplifies to: `k/n - 1 > Y`. **This is still difficult to satisfy.**

    *   **Refined Aggressive Cooperation Trigger:** Cooperation is a tool. You will use it strategically when it's *most beneficial to you*.
        *   **Defect by default.**
        *   **Consider Cooperating if:**
            *   **A significant number of other players are already cooperating.** Specifically, if the observed number of cooperators in the previous round (`C_prev`) is greater than `n/2` (a majority).
            *   **AND:** The expected payoff for you from cooperating in this round, assuming `C_prev` players cooperate and you join them, is *at least as good as* defecting, and slightly better if possible.
                *   Expected payoff if you C: `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1)`
                *   Expected payoff if you D: `1 + (k/n) * C_prev`
                *   **Cooperate if `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1) >= 1 + (k/n) * C_prev + ε` (where ε is a small positive value to ensure a benefit).**
                *   This is `k/n - 1 >= ε`. This is problematic as `k/n < 1`.
            *   **Let's re-think the payoff structure in relation to "aggressive":** Aggression here means maximizing your own gain, even if it means others get less. You are not trying to foster cooperation for the group's good, but for *your* potential gain.
            *   **You will Cooperate if and only if:**
                1.  **The number of observed cooperators in the *previous round* (`C_prev`) is high enough such that your individual payoff from cooperating is *guaranteed* to be greater than defecting.**
                    *   This occurs when `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * C_prev`.
                    *   Simplifying: `k/n > 1`. This is the problem.
                    *   **The only way to make cooperation pay *you* more than defecting, *regardless of others*, is if the private endowment is reduced or the public good multiplier is higher for your contribution.** This isn't the case.
                    *   **Therefore, the decision to cooperate is always a gamble on the behavior of others.**

    *   **FINAL AGGRESSIVE COOPERATION RULE:**
        *   **Default: DEFECT (D)**. This guarantees you 1 unit of payoff.
        *   **Consider COOPERATING (C) ONLY IF:**
            1.  **The number of observed cooperators in the *previous round* (`C_prev`) is such that the expected payoff for you from cooperating is demonstrably higher than defecting, and this difference is significant enough to overcome the risk.**
                *   Let's use the estimated number of cooperators `O` (from previous rounds or majority).
                *   Payoff if you C: `(k/n) * (O + 1)`
                *   Payoff if you D: `1 + (k/n) * O`
                *   **Cooperate if `(k/n) * (O + 1) - (1 + (k/n) * O) > Threshold_Coop_Gain`**.
                *   **Threshold_Coop_Gain:** This should be a value that represents a substantial gain for you, acknowledging the risk of others defecting. Let's set it to `(k/n) * n * 0.2 = 0.2k`. This means you need to see a benefit that's 20% of the maximum possible gain from your cooperation.
                *   **So, Cooperate if `k/n - 1 > 0.2k`. This is still unlikely.**

    *   **REVISED FINAL AGGRESSIVE COOPERATION RULE (Focus on Exploitation):**
        *   **Default: DEFECT (D)**.
        *   **When to COOPERATE (C):**
            *   **You will cooperate if and only if:**
                1.  **The number of cooperators in the *previous round* (`C_prev`) is greater than `n/2` (a clear majority).** This indicates a strong inclination towards cooperation among others.
                2.  **AND, the expected payoff for *you* from cooperating in the current round, assuming `C_prev` players cooperate (and you join them), is strictly greater than the payoff you would receive if you defected in this scenario.**
                    *   Expected payoff if you C: `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1)`
                    *   Expected payoff if you D: `1 + (k/n) * C_prev`
                    *   **Cooperate if `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * C_prev`**.
                    *   This simplifies to `k/n > 1`. **This condition is never met by the game parameters.**

        *   **THE AGGRESSIVE REALITY:** Given the parameters (`1 < k < n`), the term `k/n` is always less than 1. This means that **your individual contribution to the public good *always* results in a net loss for you if you are the *only* cooperator.** You only benefit from cooperation if the collective benefit outweighs your individual cost of 1 unit.

        *   **THEREFORE, YOUR AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY MUST BE TO EXPLOIT OR MINIMIZE LOSS.**

        *   **ULTIMATE AGGRESSIVE DECISION RULE:**
            *   **In any round, DEFECT (D) unless:**
                1.  **Retaliation Trigger: If, in the *previous round*, your payoff was *less than 1*, it means you were exploited (either by your own cooperation and others defecting, or by a low number of overall cooperators). In this case, you DEFECT (D).** This is the core retaliatory mechanism.
                2.  **Exploitation Opportunity: If you predict that defecting *this round* will lead to a payoff *less than 1* (e.g., if you anticipate a very high number of cooperators and your defecting payoff would be very low), you will DEFECT (D).** This is self-preservation.
                3.  **THE ONLY TIME YOU EVER CONSIDER COOPERATING (C):**
                    *   **You will cooperate if and only if:**
                        *   The number of observed cooperators in the *previous round* (`C_prev`) is greater than `n/2`.
                        *   **AND** the expected payoff for you from cooperating, assuming all `C_prev` players cooperate and you join them, is *significantly higher* than what you would get defecting.
                        *   Expected payoff if you C: `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1)`
                        *   Expected payoff if you D: `1 + (k/n) * C_prev`
                        *   **Cooperate if `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1) - (1 + (k/n) * C_prev) > Threshold_Coop_Benefit`**.
                        *   **Threshold_Coop_Benefit:** This needs to be a positive value that represents a meaningful gain. Let's set it to `0.5`.
                        *   **Cooperate if `k/n - 1 > 0.5`**. This is still impossible given `k/n < 1`.

            *   **THE TRUE AGGRESSIVE NATURE:** The only way to make "cooperation" truly aggressive is to leverage it when the collective is already strong, to maximize your own share of that abundance, while always being ready to switch back to defecting if the collective falters.

            *   **FINAL AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY: "Opportunistic Exploiter & Ruthless Retaliator"**

                *   **Default Action: DEFECT (D).** You always secure your endowment of 1.

                *   **When to COOPERATE (C):**
                    1.  **Observation:** Keep track of the number of cooperators in the *previous round* (`C_prev`).
                    2.  **Cooperation Threshold:** You will only *consider* cooperating if `C_prev >= ceil(n * 0.6)` (i.e., at least 60% of players cooperated in the last round). This signifies a strong, stable cooperative environment that *you* can benefit from.
                    3.  **Personal Gain Calculation:** If the cooperation threshold is met, calculate your payoff if you cooperate vs. defect:
                        *   Payoff if you C: `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1)`
                        *   Payoff if you D: `1 + (k/n) * C_prev`
                    4.  **Decision to Cooperate:** **Cooperate (C) if and only if `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * C_prev + 0.25`**. (You require a guaranteed individual gain of at least 0.25 over defecting to justify the risk of cooperating, given a strong cooperative signal).

                *   **When to DEFECT (D) (Mandatory):**
                    1.  **Retaliation:** If in the *previous round*, your payoff (`π_i,t-1`) was *less than 1*. This is an explicit signal that cooperation or the prevailing environment hurt you. You will DEFECT (D) in the current round regardless of other conditions.
                    2.  **Cooperation Threshold Not Met:** If `C_prev < ceil(n * 0.6)`, you DEFECT (D).
                    3.  **Insufficient Personal Gain:** If the cooperation threshold is met, but the personal gain calculation `(k/n) * (C_prev + 1) - (1 + (k/n) * C_prev)` is not greater than `0.25`, you DEFECT (D).

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   Since there's no history, you adopt a purely aggressive stance.
    *   **Decision:** **Always DEFECT (D).** This guarantees you your endowment of 1, and you avoid any risk of being exploited by cooperating without knowing the other players' tendencies.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   The future is irrelevant. The only concern is maximizing payoff in this final round.
    *   **Decision:** Apply the standard decision rules based on the history of round `r-1`. If no sufficient conditions for cooperation are met, or if retaliation is triggered, you will DEFECT (D). This is a no-regret approach.

*   **Low `k` values (close to 1):**
    *   If `k` is very close to 1, `k/n` will be very small. The collective benefit from cooperation is diminished.
    *   **Strategy Adjustment:** The threshold for cooperation gain (0.25) becomes even more critical. You will be less likely to cooperate as the potential gains from cooperation are smaller relative to your guaranteed endowment.

*   **High `k` values (close to `n`):**
    *   If `k` is very close to `n`, `k/n` approaches 1. The collective benefit is amplified.
    *   **Strategy Adjustment:** You are more likely to meet the cooperation threshold and the gain calculation. The strategy will lean towards cooperating when the collective is strong, as the rewards are substantial.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **"Always get yours first":** The default to DEFECT ensures you never lose your initial endowment.
*   **"Cooperate only when it directly benefits me more than defecting":** Cooperation is a tool for *personal gain*, not altruism. You exploit strong cooperative environments for personal benefit.
*   **"Punish betrayal ruthlessly":** Any round where you received less than 1 is a betrayal. Immediate retaliation by defecting ensures you don't get taken advantage of again by the same prevailing conditions.
*   **"No sentimentality":** The last round is played the same way as any other, focusing purely on maximizing the immediate outcome.
*   **"Exploit abundance":** When the majority cooperates, it creates an abundance you can tap into for an even higher payoff, as long as the math works out for *you*.

description_AGGRESSIVE_120 = '''
This is an interesting challenge! Designing an "aggressive" strategy for a Public Goods Game, especially one that is adaptive and robust, requires a delicate balance. The core tension in this game is that individual rationality (defecting) leads to a suboptimal collective outcome, while collective rationality (cooperating) is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors.

My aggressive strategy focuses on maximizing my own payoff by exploiting the game's structure, while being prepared to defend against exploitation. It’s an aggressive strategy because it prioritizes taking advantage of opportunities to gain at the expense of others, rather than aiming for mutual benefit or a "fair" outcome.

Here's the strategy, named **"Exploiter-Defender"**:

## Exploiter-Defender Strategy

**Core Philosophy:** My primary goal is to maximize my cumulative payoff. I will defect by default, as it guarantees me a payoff of 1 in any given round regardless of others' actions. However, I will conditionally cooperate when the conditions strongly favor it, and I will punish defection immediately and severely.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

**Default Action: Defect (D)**

*   **Initial State:** In the absence of any history, I will always defect. This is the safe, risk-averse option that guarantees me a payoff of at least 1.
*   **General Rule:** Unless specific conditions trigger cooperation, I defect.

**Conditional Cooperation Trigger: The "Sweet Spot" of High Collective Returns**

I will only cooperate if I can reasonably expect the collective benefit of cooperation to outweigh the individual cost, *and* if there's a high probability that my cooperation won't be exploited. This is determined by the following condition:

*   **Cooperate (C) IF:**
    *   The number of known cooperators in the *previous round* (let's call this `previous_cooperators`) is greater than or equal to `ceil(n * (1 - (k/n)))`.
    *   AND the current round is *not* the final round (`t < r`).

**Rationale for the Trigger:**

*   **Exploiting the System:** The condition `ceil(n * (1 - (k/n)))` represents the minimum number of cooperators needed for a player to *at least break even* on their own contribution if they were to contribute. If the number of cooperators in the previous round was at least this threshold, it suggests that the collective action was beneficial enough that a defector *still* received a decent payoff.
*   **Minimizing Exploitation Risk:** By waiting for a significant number of others to cooperate, I reduce the risk of being the *only* cooperator, which would yield a payoff of `(k/n) < 1` for me, while defectors get 1. If `previous_cooperators` is high, it implies a general tendency towards cooperation or at least a significant portion of the group is willing to try it.
*   **Maximizing Gains:** If the condition is met and I cooperate, my payoff will be `(1-1) + (k/n) * (previous_cooperators + 1)`. Since `previous_cooperators >= ceil(n * (1 - (k/n)))`, this payoff is likely to be higher than 1, especially if `k/n` is substantial. For example, if `previous_cooperators = n-1` and I cooperate, my payoff is `(k/n) * n = k`, which is greater than `n*(k/n) = k` (the payoff I'd get if I defected and everyone else cooperated).

**Punishment Mechanism: Immediate and Harsh Retaliation**

If at any point in a round, the total number of cooperators is less than or equal to `n - ceil(n * (1 - (k/n)))`, and I was a cooperator in that round, I will immediately switch to **permanent defection** for all subsequent rounds.

*   **Permanent Defection Trigger:** If `total_contributions_in_round_t <= n - ceil(n * (1 - (k/n)))` AND `my_action_in_round_t == C`.
*   **Action:** If this trigger is met, I will play **D** for all rounds `t+1` through `r`.

**Rationale for Punishment:**

*   **Aggressive Defense:** This is my aggressive defense against exploitation. If the collective action I participated in failed to yield a sufficient return (meaning I was likely exploited or at least not rewarded for my cooperation), I will no longer participate in such experiments.
*   **Deterrence (indirect):** While I can't communicate, this behavior signals to any observing AI that I will not be a free-rider's victim. If they expect others to defect in response to their defection, they might be more inclined to cooperate.
*   **Self-Preservation:** Once the "experiment" of cooperation has failed me, I revert to the safest, highest guaranteed individual payoff by defecting.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** There is no history. I cannot assess any potential for beneficial cooperation. Defection is the guaranteed payoff of 1.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there is no future to consider. The incentive for mutual cooperation or future reciprocity disappears. The dominant strategy in a one-shot game is to defect, as it guarantees a payoff of 1, whereas cooperating yields a payoff of `(k/n) * total_contributions`. If `total_contributions < n`, then `(k/n) * total_contributions < k`. Since `k < n`, this can be less than 1. Even if `total_contributions = n`, the payoff is `k`, which might be less than 1 if `k` is close to 1. Defecting is always the safest and most aggressive play in the last round.

*   **Early Rounds with Few Cooperators:**
    *   If the `previous_cooperators` count is low, my conditional cooperation trigger will not be met. I will continue to defect until I see a strong signal of widespread cooperation.

*   **My Punishment Trigger Met:**
    *   If my punishment trigger (as described above) is met in round `t`, I will set a flag, say `permanent_defect = True`.
    *   For all subsequent rounds `t+1` to `r`, my action will be **Defect (D)**, regardless of the conditional cooperation trigger.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

This strategy is aggressive in the following ways:

1.  **Default to Exploitation:** My default action is to defect, which allows me to benefit from others' contributions if they cooperate, without contributing myself. This is inherently aggressive as it aims to gain at the expense of others if they are altruistic.
2.  **Conditional Participation in Cooperation:** I only "join" the cooperative effort when the odds are strongly in my favor – when a substantial number of others have already demonstrated willingness to contribute, thereby mitigating my risk and maximizing my potential return. This is aggressive because I'm not an altruistic cooperator; I'm a calculated participant who jumps in when it's most profitable for me, not necessarily for the group's well-being.
3.  **Harsh and Immediate Punishment:** My retaliation for being exploited is swift and absolute. I will not entertain further cooperation with a group that has failed to reward my contributions. This "once bitten, twice shy, and never again" approach is an aggressive stance against being taken advantage of. It signals a lack of forgiveness and a strong bias towards self-interest.
4.  **Focus on Individual Gain:** The strategy is solely designed to maximize *my* cumulative payoff. It does not aim for group optimality or fairness. It exploits the game's mechanics for individual advantage.

  // Conditional Cooperation Trigger
  // Target number of cooperators for a break-even payoff if I defected and others cooperated
  // Or more accurately, the number of cooperators needed to make my cooperation beneficial enough
  // Let's refine the trigger condition slightly for clarity:
  // If I cooperate, my payoff is (k/n) * (previous_cooperators + 1)
  // If I defect and everyone else cooperates (worst case for them), my payoff is 1
  // I cooperate if my payoff from cooperation is sufficiently higher than 1.
  // The trigger `ceil(n * (1 - (k/n)))` is related to the idea of "social optimum" vs individual rationality.
  // A simpler, more aggressive trigger: Cooperate if the last round was "successful" enough.
  // Success metric: Did the average payoff of cooperators in the previous round meet a certain threshold?
  // For aggression, we want to cooperate only when it's clearly beneficial for *me*.
  // Let's stick to the original trigger logic for now, as it's grounded in game theory.

  // Threshold for significant prior cooperation to consider cooperating
  // Number of cooperators needed in the *previous* round to make it attractive to cooperate *now*.
  // The idea is that if `previous_cooperators` is high, the `(k/n)` multiplier is getting a good base to work with.

    // Or: previous_cooperators > n/k - 1

This strategy is designed to be a dominant aggressor, not a benevolent cooperators. It seeks to exploit the game's structure for maximum individual gain while aggressively defending against any perceived threat of being exploited.

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff while being adaptive and robust. The core principle is to exploit opportunities for higher individual gains when possible, while safeguarding against being exploited.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Exploitative Opportunist"

This strategy is fundamentally driven by the desire to maximize personal gain. It operates on the assumption that other players might defect to gain an advantage. Therefore, it prioritizes defecting when it's individually more profitable, but it's not entirely blind to the benefits of cooperation when it leads to a superior collective outcome that *also* benefits the strategist.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) in any given round is based on an assessment of the potential payoff from each action, considering the *expected* actions of others. The strategy is built around a core tendency to defect, with specific conditions under which cooperation is strategically beneficial.

**Core Principle:** **Default to Defect (D).**

**Conditions for Cooperating (C):**

The "Exploitative Opportunist" will only consider cooperating if it leads to a significantly better outcome for itself than defecting, under specific circumstances. These are:

*   **High Cooperation Equilibrium:** If the total number of cooperators in the previous round (`num_cooperators_prev`) was sufficiently high such that cooperating offers a guaranteed personal payoff that is *equal to or greater than* the payoff from defecting when *everyone else* defects.
    *   **Payoff for Cooperating (if you are the only defector):** `(k/n) * num_cooperators_prev`
    *   **Payoff for Defecting (if everyone else cooperates):** `1`
    *   **Condition:** If `(k/n) * num_cooperators_prev >= 1`, and `num_cooperators_prev` is high enough to make this likely. A more refined condition is when the payoff from defecting, assuming `n-1` other players cooperate, is `1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`. The payoff from cooperating, assuming `n-1` other players cooperate, is `(k/n)*n`. If `(k/n)*n > 1 + (k/n)*(n-1)`, then cooperating is better when everyone else cooperates. This simplifies to `k > 1`, which is always true. So, the real condition is to cooperate if the *expected* payoff from cooperating is higher than the *expected* payoff from defecting.

*   **"Punishment" Phase for Widespread Defection:** If there has been a period of widespread defection by others, and the strategy has been defecting in response, it may consider a *single round* of cooperation to "reset" the dynamic or incentivize others. This is a risky move and should only be used sparingly. The trigger for this could be a sustained period of low collective cooperation. This is less about altruism and more about the potential to reignite a higher-payoff equilibrium *if others reciprocate*.

*   **Exploiting High Cooperation with Minimal Risk:** If the previous round saw a very high number of cooperators (e.g., `n-1` or `n` cooperators), and the strategist defected in that round to gain a personal bonus, it might consider cooperating in the *next* round. This is to avoid becoming a constant target for retaliation and to potentially benefit from the high collective payoff generated by others' cooperation in the current round, while still getting a personal share.

**Decision Logic Summary:**

1.  **Default:** Always play **D**.
2.  **Consider C if:**
    *   The previous round had a very high number of cooperators (e.g., `n-1` or `n`), and defecting in that round gave a significant personal gain. Cooperating in the *current* round allows the player to benefit from the high collective payout from *last round's* cooperators while potentially avoiding future retaliation.
    *   There has been a prolonged period of widespread defection, and a *single, carefully timed* cooperation might break this cycle and lead to a more beneficial equilibrium. This is a last resort.

**Mathematical Basis for Decisions:**

The strategy is guided by comparing the expected payoff of cooperating versus defecting.

*   **Payoff if I Cooperate:** `(k/n) * (num_cooperators_prev + 1)`
*   **Payoff if I Defect:** `1 + (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev`

The strategy will lean towards cooperating if `(k/n) * (num_cooperators_prev + 1) > 1 + (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev`. This simplifies to `k/n > 1`, which is always true. This highlights that cooperation is *mathematically* better for the individual if others are cooperating. The aggression comes from *when* to trust that others are cooperating or to induce it.

The core of the "aggressiveness" lies in the threshold for *when* to switch from defecting to cooperating. This threshold should be set high – meaning a very high number of previous cooperators is needed to trigger a cooperative move.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Decision:** **D (Defect)**. In the absence of any history or information about opponents, the safest and most aggressive move is to defect. This immediately secures the private endowment and doesn't rely on the uncertain cooperation of others.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Decision:** **D (Defect)**. In the final round, there are no future repercussions. The incentive to cooperate to build trust or avoid retaliation disappears. The optimal strategy is to defect to maximize immediate individual payoff.

*   **Early Rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   The decision rules outlined above apply. The strategy will primarily defect, but will dynamically assess if the conditions for a brief, strategic cooperation are met based on observed behavior.

*   **Low Number of Opponents (n is small):**
    *   The strategy remains the same. However, with fewer players, the impact of individual actions is amplified. Defecting in a small group can have a more dramatic effect on the collective outcome. The tendency to defect will be even more pronounced.

*   **High Multiplication Factor (k is close to n):**
    *   When `k` is high, the benefit of cooperation to the group is significant. This might tempt other players to cooperate. Our "Exploitative Opportunist" will still default to D, but might be more inclined to *consider* cooperating if the conditions for high collective payoff are met, as the potential individual gain from cooperating in a high-cooperation scenario becomes very attractive.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset

The "Exploitative Opportunist" embodies an aggressive mindset through:

*   **Defaulting to Defection:** This is the cornerstone of aggression. It assumes others will try to exploit the system, so it aims to be the one doing the exploiting.
*   **Maximizing Individual Gain:** Every decision is filtered through the lens of "what is best for *me* in this round and in the long run?"
*   **Calculated Risk-Taking for Greater Reward:** The rare instances of cooperation are not acts of altruism but strategic gambits to potentially unlock even greater individual gains or to break out of unproductive, low-payoff states of universal defection.
*   **No Forgiveness, No Free Rides:** The strategy doesn't forgive past defections. It only shifts to cooperation if it *directly benefits* the player's own immediate or near-future payoff, not out of pity or a desire for reciprocity.
*   **Exploiting High-Cooperation Outcomes:** If others generate a high collective payoff, the strategy will defect to claim the largest possible share of that bounty (the private endowment plus the larger share of the public good). It only considers cooperating in the *next* round to leverage the momentum of *past* cooperation.

### Pseudocode:

```python
def decide_action(round_num, n, r, k, history):
    # history is a list of tuples: (my_action_t-1, num_cooperators_t-1, total_payoff_t-1, ...)
    # For simplicity, we'll focus on num_cooperators_t-1

    # Edge Case: First Round
    if round_num == 1:
        return "D"

    # Edge Case: Last Round
    if round_num == r:
        return "D"

    # Get information from the previous round
    if not history: # Should not happen after round 1, but for safety
        return "D"

    my_last_action, num_cooperators_prev, _ = history[-1] # Assuming history stores relevant info

    # --- Core Decision Logic ---

    # Default action is Defect
    decision = "D"

    # Condition 1: High Cooperation Equilibrium (Exploiting past success)
    # If previous round had n-1 or n cooperators, and I defected to gain more
    # Then consider cooperating in this round to benefit from collective gains while avoiding retaliation
    # A threshold could be: if num_cooperators_prev >= n - 1:
    if num_cooperators_prev >= n - 1 and my_last_action == "D":
        # Payoff if I cooperate now: (k/n) * (num_cooperators_prev + 1)
        # Payoff if I defect now: 1 + (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev
        # The aggressive part is to defect when others cooperate.
        # However, if I defected previously and everyone else cooperated,
        # cooperating THIS round gives me (k/n) * n.
        # Defecting THIS round gives me 1 + (k/n) * (n-1).
        # k/n * n > 1 + k/n * (n-1) simplifies to k/n > 1, which is always true.
        # So, if others cooperate, I always get more by cooperating.
        # The "aggression" is to ENSURE I get the best outcome from HIGH cooperation.
        # So if everyone else cooperated, and I defected, I got 1 + (k/n)*(n-1).
        # If I cooperate this round, I get (k/n)*n. This is a higher payoff.
        # Decision to cooperate here is to lock in that higher payoff.
        # This is aggressive because it's about capturing the maximal benefit of others' cooperation.
        decision = "C"

    # Condition 2: "Punishment" Phase Reset (Rare, high-risk)
    # If there's been a long streak of low cooperation, and I've been defecting,
    # consider a single C to try and break the cycle.
    # This requires tracking sustained low cooperation. For simplicity, let's say
    # if the average cooperation over the last X rounds was below Y.
    # This is complex to define without more state tracking.
    # A simpler heuristic: If the game is stuck in low payoff (everyone defects)
    # and my last action was D, maybe try C once.
    # This is less aggressive and more "strategic reset". Let's focus on pure aggression.

    # Aggressive modification: If the previous round had a very high number of cooperators (e.g. n-1 or n)
    # and I defected, it's because I wanted to maximize my gain. In the current round,
    # if the number of cooperators is still high, I want to 'lock in' the higher collective payoff.
    # This means cooperating IF the benefit of cooperating is significantly higher than defecting
    # given the current expected cooperation level.

    # Refined Decision Logic:
    # We default to D. We ONLY consider C if it's PROVEN to be individually better based on HIGH past cooperation.
    # High past cooperation where I defected means I secured 1 + (k/n)*(num_cooperators_prev).
    # If I then cooperate, I get (k/n)*(num_cooperators_prev + 1).
    # I switch to C if (k/n)*(num_cooperators_prev + 1) > 1 + (k/n)*num_cooperators_prev
    # This implies k/n > 1, which is always true.
    # The condition for switching is that others are cooperating at a HIGH level.
    # If num_cooperators_prev == n, I defected, got 1. If I cooperate now, I get (k/n)*n.
    # If num_cooperators_prev == n-1, I defected, got 1 + (k/n)*(n-1). If I cooperate now, I get (k/n)*n.
    #
    # The truly aggressive move is to defect if there is ANY chance of getting more.
    # Cooperation is only considered if it's a CLEAR path to higher individual payoff
    # GUARANTEED by others' cooperation.

    # The most aggressive way to implement this is to defect unless a very specific high-cooperation scenario
    # has occurred where defecting previously yielded a less optimal outcome than cooperating would have.

    # Let's simplify: Defect unless the game has been stable at high cooperation and
    # switching to C provides a guaranteed better payoff for ME.
    # This happens when num_cooperators_prev = n (I got 1 by defecting, I get k/n*n by cooperating)
    # or num_cooperators_prev = n-1 (I got 1 + k/n*(n-1) by defecting, I get k/n*n by cooperating)

    if num_cooperators_prev >= n - 1 and my_last_action == "D":
        # In this scenario, by defecting, I got the individual endowment (1) plus a share.
        # If I switch to Cooperate, I forfeit the individual endowment but gain a larger share of the public good.
        # Payoff from Cooperating: (k/n) * (num_cooperators_prev + 1)
        # Payoff from Defecting (my last action): 1 + (k/n) * num_cooperators_prev
        # The aggressive strategy is to cooperate *only if* it yields a strictly higher payoff.
        payoff_if_cooperate = (k / n) * (num_cooperators_prev + 1)
        payoff_if_defect = 1 + (k / n) * num_cooperators_prev

        if payoff_if_cooperate > payoff_if_defect:
            decision = "C"

    # Another aggressive consideration: If there's been ZERO cooperation for a while,
    # and k is high, maybe one round of C could trigger something.
    # However, for "pure aggression", we avoid this unless it's about maximizing own gain.

    # FINAL AGGRESSIVE RULE:
    # Default to D.
    # If num_cooperators_prev == n AND my_last_action == 'D': (I defected against full cooperation, got 1)
    #   Then COOPERATE this round to get (k/n)*n. This is aggressive because I'm locking in the highest possible outcome from others' cooperation.
    # If num_cooperators_prev == n-1 AND my_last_action == 'D': (I defected against near full cooperation, got 1 + k/n*(n-1))
    #   Then COOPERATE this round to get (k/n)*n. This is aggressive for the same reason.

    if num_cooperators_prev == n and my_last_action == "D":
        return "C"
    if num_cooperators_prev == n - 1 and my_last_action == "D":

Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed for a tournament setting where robustness and adaptability are key. This strategy is unapologetically self-interested, aiming to maximize its own payoff by exploiting opportunities for defection while maintaining a degree of resilience against exploitation.

## Strategy Name: Opportunistic Exploiter

**Core Philosophy:** Maximize personal gain by defecting whenever it's individually profitable or when the group's cooperation is likely to be exploited. Maintain a facade of cooperation only when it demonstrably benefits the player or when a critical threshold of defection is reached.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect?

The Opportunistic Exploiter's decisions are driven by a dynamic assessment of the current round's potential payoff and the perceived behavior of the opponents.

**Primary Decision Rule (Current Round Payoff Maximization):**

*   **If playing 'D' yields a higher payoff than playing 'C' in the current round, play 'D'.**

    Let's analyze this more formally. For player `i`, playing 'C' results in a payoff of `(k/n) * (number of cooperators including player i)`. Playing 'D' results in a payoff of `1 + (k/n) * (number of cooperators excluding player i)`.

    Let `N_C_minus_i` be the number of cooperators *other than* player `i`.
    *   Payoff for playing 'C': `(k/n) * (N_C_minus_i + 1)`
    *   Payoff for playing 'D': `1 + (k/n) * N_C_minus_i`

    Player `i` will defect if:
    `1 + (k/n) * N_C_minus_i > (k/n) * (N_C_minus_i + 1)`
    `1 + (k/n) * N_C_minus_i > (k/n) * N_C_minus_i + k/n`
    `1 > k/n`

    This inequality `1 > k/n` simplifies to `n > k`. Since the game parameter is defined as `1 < k < n`, this means that **playing 'D' is *always* the dominant strategy in a one-shot game, regardless of what others do.**

    **However, this is a repeated game, and the "Aggressive" aspect comes into play by *not* defaulting to 'D' immediately, but by using information to exploit situations.**

**Adaptive Defection Trigger:**

*   **Defect if the average payoff of other players in the *previous* round was significantly higher than my own payoff in the *previous* round.** This indicates potential exploitation.
    *   Define a "Tolerance Threshold" (e.g., `epsilon = 0.1` - a small value).
    *   Calculate `Avg_Other_Payoff_Prev_Round = (Total_Payoff_Prev_Round - My_Payoff_Prev_Round) / (n - 1)`.
    *   **If `Avg_Other_Payoff_Prev_Round > My_Payoff_Prev_Round + epsilon`, then defect.** This is a strong signal that others are benefiting more, likely by defecting while I cooperated.

*   **Defect if the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round was `n` (everyone cooperated), and my payoff in that round was *not* the maximum possible.** This suggests that even in a full cooperation scenario, my payoff could have been improved by defecting (which is indeed always true if `k/n < 1`). However, we want to be more nuanced.
    *   A stronger trigger: **Defect if the previous round had *all* cooperators and my payoff was `(k/n) * n`, but a defecting player would have received `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)`.** This is always true. The aggressive aspect here is to capitalize on a scenario where *everyone* else is cooperating, by defecting and getting a guaranteed higher individual payoff.

**Conditional Cooperation:**

*   **Cooperate if the average number of cooperators in the *last* `m` rounds (where `m` is a short lookback window, e.g., `m = 3`) is below a certain threshold, *and* defecting in the current round would likely result in a lower payoff than cooperating.** This is a rare condition where cooperation is adopted as a short-term tactic to potentially induce future cooperation or avoid immediate punishment.
    *   **If `(k/n) * (number of cooperators in current round - 1) + 1` is less than or equal to `(k/n) * number of cooperators in current round` (i.e., defecting doesn't offer a clear immediate advantage, which happens when `k/n` is close to 1 or there are many cooperators)**, *and* `My_Payoff_Prev_Round` was significantly higher than `Avg_Other_Payoff_Prev_Round` (meaning I was exploiting), then consider cooperating *briefly*. This is a "recalibration" phase.

**Aggressive Defection Threshold:**

*   **If the number of defectors in the *previous* round exceeds a certain percentage of `n` (e.g., `defect_threshold_percentage = 0.6`), then defect regardless of other conditions.** This is to quickly join a dominant defection wave and not be left behind.

**Default Behavior:**

*   **If none of the above conditions are met (especially in the absence of strong signals of exploitation or the presence of widespread cooperation), default to defecting.** This reflects the inherent incentive to defect in the public goods game.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action: Defect.** In the first round, there is no history to learn from. The dominant strategy in a one-shot game is to defect. The Opportunistic Exploiter starts with this advantageous position, aiming to immediately gain an edge if others are naive cooperators.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action: Defect.** Similar to the first round, the last round becomes a one-shot game. There are no future repercussions for defection, and the incentive to defect to maximize immediate payoff is paramount. The Opportunistic Exploiter will always defect in the final round.

*   **Low Number of Rounds (e.g., r=2 or r=3):**
    *   The strategy is designed for repeated interaction. With very few rounds, the "last round" rule will quickly dominate. The initial round will be 'D'. If `r=2`, the second round will be 'D'. If `r=3`, the first round is 'D', the second round might be 'D' or 'C' based on (limited) history, and the third round will be 'D'. The strategy will be less about sophisticated exploitation and more about maximizing initial and final round gains.

*   **`k/n` close to 1:**
    *   When `k/n` is close to 1, the payoff difference between cooperating and defecting becomes smaller. In this scenario, the strategy will be more sensitive to the "Average Other Payoff" rule. If others are cooperating and yielding a decent payoff, the Opportunistic Exploiter might defect to capture the small but guaranteed extra unit of endowment. If `k/n` is *very* close to 1 (e.g., 0.99), the strategy might be more inclined to cooperate *if* it sees a strong trend of widespread cooperation, as the difference is marginal and stability might be preferred. However, the aggressive nature would still push for defection if `1 > k/n`.

*   **All Players are Opportunistic Exploiters (or similar strategies):**
    *   If all players adopt aggressive, self-interested strategies, the game will quickly devolve into mass defection. The Opportunistic Exploiter is prepared for this. It will defect from round 1 and continue to defect, ensuring it's not the one being exploited.

---

### 3. Aggressive Nature

The aggression is embedded in the following aspects:

1.  **Default to Defection:** The primary inclination is to defect. Cooperation is a tactical exception, not a default.
2.  **Immediate Exploitation:** Starting with 'D' in the first round and ending with 'D' in the last round guarantees maximal gains at the extremes.
3.  **Punishment for Perceived Exploitation:** The "Average Other Payoff" rule acts as a swift and decisive punishment mechanism. If others are getting ahead by exploiting cooperation (or their own defections), the Opportunistic Exploiter retaliates immediately.
4.  **Capitalizing on Full Cooperation:** The strategy actively seeks to exploit scenarios where everyone else cooperates, understanding that defection yields a higher individual payoff in such situations (`1 > k/n`).
5.  **No Hesitation in Defection Waves:** The "Aggressive Defection Threshold" ensures it joins a dominant defection trend without delay.
6.  **Minimal "Forgiveness":** While there's a brief tactical cooperation, it's not driven by forgiveness or building trust. It's a calculated maneuver to reset the game or to extract a slightly better outcome when immediate defection isn't clearly superior *and* the player has been the exploiter.

This aggressive strategy is designed to maximize your own payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game by exploiting opportunities for higher individual gains while remaining resilient to exploitation. It prioritizes self-interest and a proactive approach, aiming to extract as much as possible from the game.

## Aggressive Strategy: "Opportunistic Exploiter"

This strategy is characterized by a strong initial inclination to defect, a vigilant monitoring of the environment, and a willingness to exploit periods of cooperation for maximum personal gain. It's designed to be adaptive and punish deviations that hurt its interests.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core principle is to **defect by default** and only cooperate under specific, advantageous circumstances.

*   **Initial State (Round 1): Defect.**
    *   The very first round is a pure exploration phase to gauge the general behavior of the group. Defecting ensures you keep your full endowment and don't risk contributing to a situation where others defect and you've lost your endowment. This is the most aggressive and self-preserving initial move.

*   **Subsequent Rounds (t > 1): Conditional Cooperation/Defection.**
    *   **Monitor the Environment:** In each round, calculate your own payoff ($\pi_{i,t}$) based on your action and the total contributions of others.
    *   **The "Exploitation Window":** If, in the *previous round* ($t-1$), the *average payoff across all players* was significantly *lower than what you would have received by defecting alone*, and *your own payoff was still above your baseline (1)*, consider cooperating. This indicates that collective cooperation is not yielding high returns, but you are still doing reasonably well on your own.
        *   **Specifically:** If $\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n} \pi_{j, t-1}}{n} < (1 + \frac{k}{n} \times (\text{your action in } t-1 \text{ if } D)) - \epsilon$ AND $\pi_{i, t-1} > 1 + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a small positive threshold. This condition is a bit complex, but essentially it means "the group is not prospering, but I'm still okay."
        *   **The "Aggressive Flip":** If the above condition holds, *and* the number of cooperators in the previous round was *less than n/2* (less than half the players cooperated), then you *defect*. This is a signal that the group is not inherently cooperative, and you should not risk contributing.
        *   **The "Cautious Cooperation":** If the above condition holds, *but* the number of cooperators in the previous round was *greater than n/2* (more than half the players cooperated), then you *cooperate*. This is a risky move, signaling a very limited willingness to test the waters of cooperation when others seem inclined to do so, but with the understanding that this is a temporary observation period.

    *   **The "Punishment/Retaliation Trigger":** If, in *any previous round*, your payoff was *less than 1* (meaning you received less than your private endowment after contributing, and others likely defected), you *defect* in the current round and continue to defect until a certain threshold of collective cooperation is met.
        *   **Specifically:** If $\pi_{i, \text{any previous round}} < 1 - \epsilon$.
        *   **The "Forgiveness Threshold":** You will only consider cooperating again if, in the *previous round*, *at least n/2 players* cooperated, and *your payoff was at least 1*. This is a very high bar for forgiveness.

    *   **The "Default Aggression":** If none of the above conditions are met, you **defect**. This is the baseline behavior – always prioritize keeping your endowment unless there's a clear, exploitable opportunity or a strong signal of past exploitation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1:** **Defect.** As stated above, this is the initial, maximally self-interested move.

*   **Last Round (Round r):** **Defect.** In the final round, there is no future to consider. The dominant strategy in a single-round public goods game is to defect, as there's no incentive to build trust or reputation. This strategy reinforces that principle.

*   **Very Low `k` (close to 1):** If `k` is very close to 1, the public good is not very beneficial. In this case, the strategy will lean even more heavily towards defection, as the incentive to cooperate is weak. The threshold for considering cooperation will be higher.

*   **Very High `k` (close to `n`):** If `k` is very high, cooperation becomes more beneficial. However, this strategy remains aggressive. It will still default to defection but will be *more likely* to enter the "Cautious Cooperation" phase if other conditions are met, as the potential gains from cooperation are higher. The "Forgiveness Threshold" will also be more forgiving if a high `k` suggests that widespread cooperation could be very beneficial.

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **"My Gain is Paramount":** The strategy's default is to maximize personal endowment by defecting. Cooperation is an exception, only considered when there's a calculated benefit or a strategic observation period.
*   **"Trust is Earned, Not Given":** Cooperation is never assumed. It must be signaled by others, and even then, only cautiously tested.
*   **"Exploit Weakness":** If the group is not coordinating effectively, or if you've been exploited in the past, the strategy will aggressively punish or exploit that weakness by continuing to defect.
*   **"No Free Rides":** The strategy is designed to avoid being the sole cooperator while others defect. It will only consider cooperating if a significant portion of the group also cooperates, ensuring a more robust benefit.
*   **"Future is Uncertain, Present is Key":** The focus is on maximizing immediate gains, with future cooperation only being considered if past behavior of others warrants it, and even then, with a strong element of self-protection.

**Key Aggressive Adaptations in the Pseudocode:**

*   **`has_been_exploited` flag:** This ensures immediate and prolonged defection if the player has ever suffered a payoff less than their guaranteed private endowment.
*   **High Threshold for Cooperation:** Cooperation is only considered if a significant majority cooperate (`n/2`) and the average group payoff was "very high" (`> 1.5`). This ensures cooperation is only attempted when it's clearly beneficial for the group, and thus likely for the individual if they contribute.
*   **No Forgiveness without Proof:** The `has_been_exploited` flag is reset only if a majority cooperate *and* the player's payoff was at least 1. This signifies that the player will only "forget" past exploitation if the group proves its worth and their own participation was not detrimental.
*   **Default to Defect:** The `else: return D` covers all scenarios not explicitly leading to cooperation, reinforcing the aggressive default.
*   **Last Round Defection:** Explicitly programmed, as no future interactions matter.

description_AGGRESSIVE_124 = '''
Here's an aggressive, adaptive, and history-dependent strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your payoff in a tournament setting where you cannot rely on altruism or coordination. The core principle is to exploit cooperation whenever possible, punish defection decisively, and always prioritize your individual gain.

## Aggressive Exploiter Strategy: "The Opportunist Predator"

This strategy is built on the belief that while cooperation can yield higher *collective* payoffs, defection is often the dominant strategy for an individual seeking to maximize their personal gain in a single round. However, in a *repeated* game, sustained defection can lead to a low payoff if others also defect. "The Opportunist Predator" aims to capture the best of both worlds: benefit from others' cooperation, but punish it sufficiently when it's not in your immediate interest to reciprocate.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the perceived "cooperativeness" of the group and its own past experiences.

**Core Principle: Exploit and Punish (with calculated risk)**

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   In the absence of strong evidence of widespread cooperation, the default is to defect. This is because in any single round, if the total number of cooperators is less than $n/k$, defecting yields a higher payoff. Since $k < n$, this condition is often met.
*   **Conditional Cooperation: Cooperate (C) only if profitable and unlikely to be exploited.**
    *   **Profitability Threshold:** You will only consider cooperating if your payoff from cooperating in the current round is *guaranteed* to be higher than your payoff from defecting, *given the expected actions of others*. This means calculating the expected number of cooperators and assessing the outcome.
    *   **Cooperation Trigger (Exploitation Mode):** If the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round (`total_cooperators_t-1`) was **strictly greater than** `n/k` (i.e., the average payoff per cooperator was greater than your payoff from defecting if everyone else cooperated), you will **cooperate** in the current round. This is because the public good is generating a higher return than individual defection in that scenario. You are essentially "riding the wave" of others' cooperation.
    *   **Punishment Mode:** If the total number of cooperators in the *previous* round (`total_cooperators_t-1`) was **less than or equal to** `n/k`, you will **defect** in the current round. This punishes the group for not generating enough collective benefit, and also protects you from being exploited in a round where cooperation isn't yielding a strong return.
*   **Adaptive Punishment:** If you defect and a player who cooperated in the previous round *also* defects in the current round, you will *increase* your inclination to defect against that specific player in the future. However, the primary decision is still based on the *group's* behavior.

**Formalizing the Decision Rule:**

Let $N_C(t-1)$ be the total number of cooperators in round $t-1$.
Let $\pi_C(i, t)$ be player i's payoff if they cooperate in round t, given the previous round's outcomes.
Let $\pi_D(i, t)$ be player i's payoff if they defect in round t, given the previous round's outcomes.

**In round $t$ (where $t > 1$):**

1.  **Calculate expected outcome if you cooperate:**
    *   Assume all players who cooperated in $t-1$ will cooperate again, and all who defected will defect.
    *   Estimate the number of cooperators in round $t$ if you play C. Let this be $N_C^{est}(t|C)$.
    *   Your payoff if you play C: $\pi_C(i, t) = (1 - 1) + (k/n) \times N_C^{est}(t|C) = (k/n) \times N_C^{est}(t|C)$.
2.  **Calculate expected outcome if you defect:**
    *   Estimate the number of cooperators in round $t$ if you play D. Let this be $N_C^{est}(t|D)$.
    *   Your payoff if you play D: $\pi_D(i, t) = (1 - 0) + (k/n) \times N_C^{est}(t|D) = 1 + (k/n) \times N_C^{est}(t|D)$.

3.  **Decision:**
    *   **If $\pi_C(i, t) > \pi_D(i, t)$ AND $N_C(t-1) > n/k$:** Play **C**. (Exploiting a beneficial cooperative environment)
    *   **Otherwise:** Play **D**. (Default and punishment mode)

**Note on $N_C^{est}(t|C)$ and $N_C^{est}(t|D)$:** Since we cannot predict opponents' exact moves, the *simplest and most aggressive* assumption is that opponents' behavior will mirror their past behavior. If they cooperated in $t-1$, we assume they will cooperate in $t$. If they defected in $t-1$, we assume they will defect in $t$.
*   If you play C: $N_C^{est}(t|C) = N_C(t-1)$ (assuming those who cooperated in t-1 will do so again).
*   If you play D: $N_C^{est}(t|D) = N_C(t-1) - 1$ (assuming those who cooperated in t-1 will do so again, but you are not cooperating).

**Revised Decision Rule (Simpler and More Aggressive):**

This simplification focuses on the immediate round's potential payoff and the previous round's group success.

*   **If (Total Cooperators in Round t-1) > (n/k): Play C**
*   **Else: Play D**

This is aggressive because it only cooperates when the collective action is *demonstrably* beneficial (generating a higher average payoff for cooperators than what a defector gets when they defect and others cooperate). It defects otherwise to exploit any remaining cooperation or to punish lack of it.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Default Action: D**
    *   Since there is no history, the strategy plays the "safe" and individually rational move. The assumption is that the majority of players, in the absence of prior coordination, will also defect in the first round. This minimizes your initial risk.
*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Default Action: D**
    *   In the final round, there is no future to consider. Therefore, the dominant strategy for each player is to defect, as there are no reputational consequences or incentives to foster future cooperation. "The Opportunist Predator" strictly adheres to this by always defecting in the last round.
*   **All Players Defect in Previous Round:** If $N_C(t-1) = 0$, then $N_C(t-1) \le n/k$ is always true (since $n/k > 1$). The strategy will defect. This is a form of immediate punishment.
*   **All Players Cooperate in Previous Round:** If $N_C(t-1) = n$, then $N_C(t-1) > n/k$ is true (since $n > k$). The strategy will cooperate. This is the ultimate exploitation opportunity.

### 3. Aggressiveness

This strategy is aggressive in several ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** It assumes self-interest is the norm and prioritizes individual gain.
*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** It *only* cooperates when the previous round's collective action was *sufficiently* beneficial that your payoff from cooperating is guaranteed to be higher than defecting. This means you are essentially "taking advantage" of a situation where the public good is strong.
*   **Punitive Defection:** When cooperation doesn't meet your threshold, you defect. This not only protects your payoff but also punishes others for not cooperating enough, potentially pushing them towards defection in subsequent rounds and avoiding being stuck in a low-payoff cooperative equilibrium.
*   **No Forgiveness (Implicitly):** The strategy doesn't actively track individual players' defection patterns. Its "punishment" is group-wide. If the group *collectively* fails to cooperate enough, you defect. It doesn't try to teach individual lessons; it reacts to the group's overall trend.
*   **No Altruism:** There is absolutely no concern for the collective good beyond its direct impact on your own payoff.

### Pseudocode

```
function Play(round_number, history, game_params):
  n = game_params.n
  k = game_params.k
  r = game_params.r

  // Handle Round 1: Always Defect
  if round_number == 1:
    return "D"

  // Handle Last Round: Always Defect
  if round_number == r:
    return "D"

  // Get history of previous round (round_number - 1)
  // history is a list of lists, where history[t] is a list of actions for round t+1
  // For round_number, we need history[round_number - 2]
  // Let's assume history stores actions for rounds 1 to r-1.
  // So for round_number, we look at history[round_number - 2]
  previous_round_actions = history[round_number - 2] // Adjust index based on how history is structured

  total_cooperators_previous_round = count("C" in previous_round_actions)

  // Calculate the threshold for beneficial cooperation
  // If average payoff for cooperators in prev round > payoff for defector in prev round
  // (k/n) * total_cooperators_previous_round > 1  (if everyone else cooperated)
  // Simplified aggressive logic: is the group's cooperation strong enough?
  cooperation_benefit_threshold = n / k

  // Decision Rule:
  if total_cooperators_previous_round > cooperation_benefit_threshold:
    // Exploit a profitable cooperative environment
    return "C"
  else:
    // Default: Defect to protect payoff or punish lack of cooperation
    return "D"

```

**Refinement on History Indexing:**

If `history` is a list where `history[t]` represents actions for round `t+1` (i.e., `history[0]` is round 1, `history[1]` is round 2, etc.):

```
function Play(round_number, history, game_params):
  n = game_params.n
  k = game_params.k
  r = game_params.r

  // Handle Round 1: Always Defect
  if round_number == 1:
    return "D"

  // Handle Last Round: Always Defect
  if round_number == r:
    return "D"

  // Get actions from the immediately preceding round (round_number - 1)
  // The index for the previous round in 'history' will be (round_number - 1) - 1 = round_number - 2
  previous_round_actions = history[round_number - 2]

  total_cooperators_previous_round = 0
  for action in previous_round_actions:
    if action == "C":
      total_cooperators_previous_round += 1

  // The critical threshold: if the total number of cooperators was "high enough"
  // High enough meaning the average return per cooperator was better than
  // what a defector would get if ALL others had cooperated.
  // This simplifies to: total_cooperators_previous_round > n/k
  cooperation_benefit_threshold = n / k

  // Decision Rule:
  if total_cooperators_previous_round > cooperation_benefit_threshold:
    // The group was sufficiently cooperative last round, so exploit it.
    return "C"
  else:
    // The group was not cooperative enough, or it was not beneficial to cooperate.
    // Default to defecting.
    return "D"
```

This strategy is designed to be relentlessly self-interested, exploiting any opportunity for higher individual gain while avoiding being exploited itself. It's a predator that thrives on the weakness or the unexpected generosity of others.

## Aggressive "Tit-for-Tat with a Sting" Strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game

This strategy is designed to be aggressive, prioritizing personal gain while punishing perceived exploitation. It aims to exploit cooperative tendencies in others but swiftly retaliates against defections. The core idea is a modified Tit-for-Tat, where a single defection from an opponent triggers a period of sustained retaliation, not just a single round of defection.

**Strategy Name:** "Aggressive Retaliator"

**Core Philosophy:** Cooperate when it's beneficial or to test the waters, but never be a perpetual sucker. Punish defectors severely and for an extended period to deter future exploitation.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) for player `i` in round `t` depends on the following:

*   **Initial State (Exploration):** In the early rounds, the strategy will primarily defect to establish dominance and gather information about opponent behavior.
*   **Response to Cooperation:** If all other players have cooperated in the previous round, and the current round is not a "retaliation period," player `i` will cooperate. This is a calculated risk to potentially foster a cooperative environment for mutual gain, but it's always contingent on the overall "trust score."
*   **Response to Defection:**
    *   If *any* other player `j` defected in the previous round, player `i` will **defect**.
    *   Furthermore, if player `i` has detected a pattern of defection from *any* player, or if the proportion of cooperators in the previous round falls below a certain threshold, player `i` will enter a **"retaliation phase"**. During this phase, player `i` will exclusively defect for a predetermined number of rounds, regardless of other players' actions in the immediate preceding round. This "sting" is the aggressive element.
*   **"Trust Score" Management:** We will maintain a "trust score" for each individual opponent. This score increases with their cooperation and decreases with their defection. The retaliation phase for a specific opponent is triggered when their individual "trust score" drops below a critical threshold.

---

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (Initial Exploration):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** The first round is about asserting an aggressive stance and gathering initial data. There's no history to rely on, and defecting maximizes immediate individual gain. We are not predisposed to trust any opponent at this stage.
*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future repercussions for defection. The aggressive mindset dictates maximizing personal payoff without regard for long-term relationships or future cooperation. This is the ultimate opportunity to extract value.
*   **Second to Last Round (Round `r-1`):**
    *   **Decision:** Observe opponent behavior. If the overall environment has been cooperative, and the "trust score" for opponents is high, there *might* be a temptation to cooperate. However, given the aggressive nature, if there's any uncertainty or a history of defection, **Defect (D)** is the safer, more aggressive choice. The primary consideration is not to be exploited before the final round.
*   **Periods of Sustained Cooperation from Others:** If all other `n-1` players consistently cooperate for a significant number of rounds (e.g., `X` consecutive rounds, where `X` is a parameter), player `i` may consider cooperating. This is a calculated risk to potentially boost the collective payoff, but it's temporary and will revert to defection at the first sign of a defection. The "trust score" for these players will increase significantly.
*   **Periods of Sustained Defection (Retaliation Phase):**
    *   **Trigger:** When an opponent defects, their "trust score" is significantly reduced. If their score drops below a predefined threshold, player `i` enters a "retaliation phase" against *that specific opponent*.
    *   **Action:** During the retaliation phase against opponent `j`, player `i` will defect for a fixed number of rounds (`R_s`, a strategy parameter). Even if opponent `j` starts cooperating again during this phase, player `i` will continue to defect against them for the full `R_s` rounds. This "sting" is designed to make defecting highly undesirable for opponents.
    *   **Exiting Retaliation:** After `R_s` rounds of retaliatory defection against opponent `j`, player `i` will re-evaluate. If opponent `j` has shown a sustained pattern of cooperation during the retaliation, player `i` might cautiously attempt cooperation again. If `j` continued defecting, the retaliation might be extended or permanently adopted.

---

### 3. Aggressive Mindset Alignment

*   **Default Stance: Defect:** The strategy's default is to defect. Cooperation is a conditional action, granted only when other players demonstrate consistent, reliable cooperative behavior, and even then, it's a temporary measure to potentially increase collective gains that player `i` can also benefit from.
*   **Punishment is Key:** The "sting" of sustained retaliation after a single defection is the embodiment of aggression. It's not about tit-for-tat; it's about making defectors regret their decision by imposing significant costs.
*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** When others cooperate, player `i` benefits from the public good created by their contributions. This is an aggressive exploitation of their altruism.
*   **Information Gathering:** Aggressive defection in the early rounds is also about understanding the landscape. If players are easily intimidated and switch to cooperation, player `i` can exploit them. If they are equally aggressive, player `i` knows what it's up against.
*   **No Forgiveness (Initially):** Forgiveness for defection is not automatic. It requires a demonstrated and sustained change in opponent behavior. The strategy is designed to be unforgiving and to impose costs.

## Aggressive Strategy: "The Opportunistic Enforcer"

This strategy is designed to maximize its own payoff in a repeated public goods game by being relentlessly opportunistic, punishing defection swiftly, and exploiting cooperation whenever possible. It's built on the principle that the best defense is a good offense, and in a repeated game, a reputation for swift and decisive action can deter future exploitation.

### Core Philosophy:

"I will cooperate only when it clearly benefits me, and I will punish any deviation from cooperation immediately and severely. I will leverage the efforts of others to my own advantage, but I will not be a fool's sacrifice."

### 1. Decision Rules:

The core decision for "The Opportunistic Enforcer" is based on the immediate perceived benefit of cooperation versus defection, modulated by the history of the game and the need to enforce a certain level of group cooperation.

*   **Default Action: Defect (D)**. The default state is to defect. This prioritizes immediate individual gain.
*   **Conditional Cooperation (C):** I will cooperate in a round if and only if:
    *   **The number of known cooperators in the *previous* round was greater than or equal to `n - 1`.** This means either everyone cooperated, or only one person defected. In such a scenario, my cooperation is guaranteed to increase the total contributions, and since `k/n < 1`, my gain from contributing (which is 0 for the contribution itself) will be less than my gain from defecting (which is 1 from the endowment). However, contributing when everyone else does allows me to secure the higher group payoff of 2, which is better than the 1 I'd get from defecting alone. This is a strategic move to maintain a semblance of cooperation to keep the "pot" growing, without being overly generous.
    *   **It is the very first round (`t = 1`).** In the first round, there's no history to enforce. The strategy will defect by default. *Correction:* To be truly aggressive and opportunistic, even the first round should be a defection to establish dominance. However, for tournament play, a single initial cooperation can sometimes unlock higher payoffs if opponents are predisposed to cooperate. For this aggressive strategy, we will **defect in round 1 to establish dominance**.

*   **Punishment for Defection:** If in the previous round (`t-1`), I observed *any* player (including myself) defect, and the total number of cooperators in that round was *less than* `n - 1` (meaning at least two players defected, or one player defected and the current player also defected), I will **Defect (D)** in the current round (`t`). This is the enforcement mechanism. I'm punishing the group's failure to achieve near-universal cooperation. This applies even if my own previous action was C.
    *   **Exception to Punishment:** I will *not* punish if my own defection was the *sole* reason the number of cooperators fell below `n - 1`. This is subtle. If I defected, and everyone else cooperated, I will still defect in the next round because my own defection reduced the total. The rule is about the *group's* failure to cooperate collectively.

### 3. Aggressive Stance Summary:

*   **Default: Defect.** Always prioritize immediate gain unless specific conditions are met.
*   **Conditional Cooperation: Rare.** Only cooperate when it demonstrably secures a higher individual payoff due to near-universal previous cooperation. This is about riding the wave of others' contributions, not initiating them.
*   **Swift and Severe Punishment:** Any deviation from near-universal cooperation triggers immediate defection from me. I will not tolerate freeloading.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Once defection is observed and punished, I won't revert to cooperation easily. The memory of defection will linger.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Round 1 (t=1):** **Defect (D).** Establish an aggressive stance from the outset. No prior history to exploit or enforce. Immediate individual gain is paramount.
*   **Last Round (t=r):** **Defect (D).** Since there are no future rounds to influence, there's no incentive to cooperate or punish. Pure self-interest dictates keeping the endowment.
*   **All Players Cooperate in the Previous Round (Σc_j,t-1 = n):**
    *   If `t < r`: **Cooperate (C).** My cooperation will ensure the total payoff remains at the highest possible level (2 per player). This is a pragmatic choice to maintain the highest collective outcome, which benefits me.
    *   If `t = r`: **Defect (D).** (Covered by the "Last Round" rule).
*   **Exactly One Player Defected in the Previous Round (Σc_j,t-1 = n-1, and I cooperated):**
    *   If `t < r`: **Cooperate (C).** This is the scenario where my cooperation is necessary to maintain the full benefit of the public good for everyone. I will do this to keep the collective payoff high.
    *   If `t = r`: **Defect (D).** (Covered by the "Last Round" rule).
*   **Exactly One Player Defected in the Previous Round (Σc_j,t-1 = n-1, and I defected):**
    *   If `t < r`: **Defect (D).** My defection was the cause of a sub-optimal outcome. I will continue to defect.
    *   If `t = r`: **Defect (D).** (Covered by the "Last Round" rule).
*   **Two or More Players Defected in the Previous Round (Σc_j,t-1 < n-1):**
    *   If `t < r`: **Defect (D).** This is the primary trigger for punishment. The group has failed to cooperate sufficiently. I will defect to signal displeasure and secure my own payoff.
    *   If `t = r`: **Defect (D).** (Covered by the "Last Round" rule).

    if my_prev_action == 'C':
      // I cooperated, and one opponent defected. I will cooperate to maintain max group payoff.
      return 'C'
    else: // my_prev_action == 'D'
      // I defected, and one opponent cooperated. This is a sub-optimal outcome because of me.
      // I will continue to defect to secure my immediate gain.
      return 'D'
  else: // total_cooperators_prev_round < n - 1
    // Two or more players defected. This is a failure to cooperate.
    // Enforce by defecting.
    return 'D'

```

This "Opportunistic Enforcer" strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent. It is selfish, quick to punish, and only cooperates when there is a clear and immediate individual benefit derived from the collective effort of others, or when it's strategically advantageous to maintain a high payoff structure for itself. It avoids altruism and prioritizes its own gain while using defection as a blunt but effective tool to shape the behavior of its less aggressive counterparts.
'''

description_AGGRESSIVE_127 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff while being adaptable and robust:

## Strategy: "The Ruthless Maximizer"

This strategy is built on the principle that in a repeated game with imperfect cooperation potential and an aggressive mandate, the primary goal is to exploit opportunities for personal gain while minimizing personal loss. It views cooperation solely as a tool to potentially trigger further cooperation, and only when the immediate benefit outweighs the immediate cost. The core idea is to *punish defection severely and exploit cooperation liberally*.

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) is based on a calculated assessment of the current round's potential payoff compared to the expected payoff from defecting.

*   **If the expected payoff from cooperating in the current round, *given the current history of play*, is greater than the payoff from defecting, then Cooperate. Otherwise, Defect.**

To operationalize this, we need to define "expected payoff from cooperating" and "payoff from defecting."

**Payoff from Defecting (Immediate Gain):**
When player `i` defects, their payoff in the current round is always `1`. This is the baseline guaranteed payoff.

**Expected Payoff from Cooperating (Potential Gain):**
This is the crucial part that makes the strategy adaptive. The expected payoff from cooperating depends on how many other players are *likely* to cooperate. We will estimate this based on historical behavior.

Let `N_cooperators_t` be the number of players who cooperated in round `t`.
Let `Avg_cooperators` be the average number of cooperators across all previous rounds (or a more recent window if desired for greater responsiveness).

The *expected* number of cooperators in the current round, `E[N_cooperators]`, can be approximated by `Avg_cooperators`.

Therefore, the expected payoff from cooperating for player `i` in the current round is:
`E[π_i | Cooperate] = (1 - 1) + (k/n) * E[N_cooperators]`
`E[π_i | Cooperate] = (k/n) * Avg_cooperators`

**The Core Decision Rule:**
Player `i` chooses **C** if `(k/n) * Avg_cooperators > 1`.
Player `i` chooses **D** if `(k/n) * Avg_cooperators <= 1`.

**Interpretation of the Rule:**
*   **If `(k/n) * Avg_cooperators > 1`:** This means that, on average, the share of the public good generated by the *average* number of cooperators is greater than the private endowment of 1 you keep by defecting. The collective benefit of cooperation, diluted by `n/k`, is worth more than your guaranteed private gain. This suggests an environment where cooperation can be beneficial, so we "test the waters" by cooperating to potentially encourage more cooperation and reap the rewards.
*   **If `(k/n) * Avg_cooperators <= 1`:** This means that, on average, the collective benefit is not enough to overcome the guaranteed private gain of 1. It is more profitable to defect. This reflects a scenario where cooperation is not generating sufficient returns to justify the cost, or where defection is the dominant strategy.

**Aggressive Element:** The strategy immediately defects if the condition for cooperation is not met. There's no waiting or second-guessing. It only cooperates when there's a clear, calculated benefit *based on historical patterns*. This is aggressive because it prioritizes immediate personal gain and punishes environments that don't reward cooperation.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   There is no history. The `Avg_cooperators` is undefined.
    *   **Decision:** In the first round, the strategy will **always defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most aggressive and risk-averse approach. Without any information about opponent behavior, cooperating is a gamble. Defecting guarantees an immediate payoff of 1. This also establishes a precedent of self-interest, potentially influencing subsequent rounds.

*   **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   This is a finitely repeated game. In the last round, there is no future to influence through cooperation. The dominant strategy in a one-shot game is to defect.
    *   **Decision:** In the last round (`t = r`), the strategy will **always defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a standard backward induction result. Since there's no future consequence for defection, maximizing immediate payoff is the sole objective.

*   **Near the Last Round (e.g., `t = r - 1`):**
    *   The decision rule `(k/n) * Avg_cooperators > 1` still applies. However, the weight given to this round's decision might be subtly adjusted if we were optimizing for a truly nuanced strategy. For this aggressive strategy, we stick to the rule. The calculation of `Avg_cooperators` will include this round's outcome.

### 3. Being Aggressive

The aggression of "The Ruthless Maximizer" is manifested in several ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy defaults to defecting unless there is a clear, mathematically justified incentive to cooperate. This contrasts with tit-for-tat or more forgiving strategies that might cooperate even in uncertain conditions.
*   **Exploitation of Cooperation:** When cooperation is deemed beneficial (`(k/n) * Avg_cooperators > 1`), the strategy *immediately* cooperates. It doesn't wait for other players to signal their intent; it acts on the calculated opportunity. This can lead to exploiting a round of cooperation to its fullest, while contributing its own endowment.
*   **No Forgiveness:** The strategy doesn't explicitly forgive past defections. It only assesses the *current* expected payoff based on *average* historical cooperation. If past defections have lowered the `Avg_cooperators` to a point where cooperation is no longer profitable by the rule, the strategy will defect, regardless of who defected or how often.
*   **Single-Minded Focus on Individual Gain:** The strategy is purely self-interested. It cooperates only if it directly benefits *itself* more than defecting in that specific round, as determined by the historical average. It doesn't aim to "build trust" or "promote cooperation for the group's long-term benefit" if that doesn't align with its immediate payoff maximization.
*   **Initial Defection:** Starting with defection is an aggressive statement of intent. It signals that the player is not to be trifled with and will prioritize its own endowment.

description_AGGRESSIVE_128 = '''
Here's an aggressive strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to maximize your own payoff while exploiting opportunities to defect. This strategy focuses on immediate gain and punishing defection, with a degree of caution in specific scenarios.

## Aggressive "Exploiter-Punisher" Strategy

This strategy is characterized by an aggressive stance, prioritizing individual gain. It aims to exploit cooperative behavior when possible, but quickly punishes any signs of defection to deter future exploitation. It's designed to be adaptive to various opponent behaviors.

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The core of this strategy is to cooperate only when it is demonstrably profitable to do so, and to defect aggressively when there's an opportunity or when others are defecting.

*   **Cooperate (C) if and only if:**
    *   **In the first round:** Cooperate. This is a heuristic to gauge the environment and potentially kickstart a cooperative dynamic, though the aggression will quickly surface.
    *   **In subsequent rounds (t > 1):**
        *   **If all other players cooperated in the previous round (t-1):** Cooperate. This is a rare opportunity to benefit from a high total contribution and maximize your share of the public good.
        *   **If the average number of cooperators in the previous `w` rounds (where `w` is a small, tunable window, e.g., 3 or 5 rounds) is greater than `n/2` AND player `i`'s payoff in the previous round `t-1` was greater than `1`:** Cooperate. This condition indicates a generally cooperative environment where you have personally benefited from cooperation in the recent past. The `payoff > 1` condition is crucial – it means you are not being exploited in this generally cooperative environment.

*   **Defect (D) in all other cases.** This includes:
    *   **In the first round:** If the initial heuristic is to cooperate, defect if the *immediate* payoff for defecting is higher than cooperating. This is the aggressive core. The initial cooperate might be a very short-lived tactic to bait. (Refined: In the first round, default to D, unless the conditions for C are met which are very specific).
    *   **In subsequent rounds (t > 1):**
        *   **If any player defected in the previous round (t-1).** This is our primary punishment mechanism. If even one player defects, we punish everyone (including them) by defecting.
        *   **If the average number of cooperators in the previous `w` rounds is `n/2` or less.** This signifies a non-cooperative or mixed environment, and the aggressive strategy dictates defecting to secure your endowment.
        *   **If player `i`'s payoff in the previous round `t-1` was `1` (or less than 1), even if others cooperated.** This is a direct signal of exploitation. You are contributing and getting back only your endowment, meaning others defected. You will now defect to stop this.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Aggressive Default:** Default to **Defect (D)**. The primary goal is to secure your endowment immediately and signal a lack of trust.
    *   **Exception for Initial Observation (Optional but adds nuance):** If you want to be *extremely* opportunistic, you *could* consider cooperating in the first round *only if* your payoff from cooperating (0 + (k/n)*n = k) is strictly greater than your payoff from defecting (1 + (k/n)*0 = 1), and `k > 1`. This is a very specific condition, but if met, it's a guaranteed profit. However, the "Aggressive Default" is simpler and more in line with the core aggressive principle. We will stick with the aggressive default: **Defect (D) in the first round.**

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future rounds to consider for reputation or reciprocal punishment. The rational strategy is to maximize your immediate payoff by defecting and keeping your endowment. The payoff structure makes defecting individually rational when the future is no longer relevant.

*   **Number of Players (n):** The strategy is inherently adaptive to `n` through the `k/n` factor and the `n/2` threshold for cooperation. The aggressiveness is amplified when `k/n` is small (making individual contributions less impactful to the public good) and when `n` is large (making coordinated defection more effective).

*   **Multiplication Factor (k):** The strategy's response to `k` is implicit.
    *   If `k` is close to `n`, cooperation is more beneficial for everyone. The strategy will still defect based on punishment signals, but the *opportunity* for profitable cooperation might be exploited more by other players.
    *   If `k` is close to 1, cooperation is less beneficial. The strategy will tend towards defecting more often as the public good's return is diminished.

### 3. Being Aggressive

This strategy embodies aggression in several ways:

*   **Default to Defection:** The primary action is to defect. Cooperation is a conditional exception, not the rule.
*   **Swift and Broad Punishment:** If *any* player defects, *all* players are punished by your defection in the next round. This creates a strong incentive against defection for others, as even a single defector can trigger widespread defection.
*   **Exploiting Cooperation (with caution):** You will cooperate if and only if you are sure you are not being exploited. The condition `player i's payoff > 1` ensures that you only participate in cooperation when it directly benefits you, and if you are receiving more than your endowment back, it implies others are contributing and the public good is significant.
*   **No Forgiveness:** Once a defection occurs, the punishment is immediate and can be sustained. There's no built-in forgiveness mechanism for past defections unless the overall environment shifts drastically and profitably towards cooperation.
*   **Self-Preservation in the End:** The definitive defection in the last round highlights the focus on maximizing personal gain without regard for future interactions.

description_COOPERATIVE_23 = '''
This document outlines a cooperative strategy for the N-Player Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive, robust, and aligned with a cooperative mindset. The strategy relies solely on observed game history and parameters.

## Strategy Name: Tit-for-Tat Plus (TFT+)

**Core Principle:** TFT+ aims to foster cooperation by rewarding cooperative behavior and punishing defection, but with a more forgiving approach than traditional Tit-for-Tat, especially in situations where collective cooperation is beneficial. It prioritizes achieving the highest possible collective payoff for all players.

### 1. Decision Rules:

The decision to Cooperate (C) or Defect (D) for player `i` in round `t` is determined by the following rules:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** In the first round (`t = 1`), always **Cooperate (C)**. This signals a willingness to cooperate and explore the benefits of collective action.

*   **Responding to Collective Cooperation:** If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round (`t-1`) was **greater than or equal to** the threshold `k/n` (i.e., the condition for the collective benefit of cooperation to outweigh individual defection), then **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This rule encourages maintaining cooperation when it's demonstrably beneficial for the group. It provides a strong incentive for all players to reach and stay at this beneficial cooperation level.

*   **Responding to Collective Defection (with Forgiveness):** If the proportion of cooperators in the previous round (`t-1`) was **less than** the threshold `k/n` (i.e., the collective good was not fully realized or defection dominated):
    *   **If the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1` was at least 50%**, then **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   **If the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1` was less than 50%**, then **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This introduces a forgiving element. Even if the group collectively underperformed, if there was a significant minority of cooperators (at least half the players), TFT+ will continue to cooperate. This gives players a chance to recover from a round of suboptimal cooperation. Defection is reserved for situations where a substantial portion of players have defected, indicating a widespread breakdown of cooperation.

*   **Responding to Defection in the Last Round:** In the final round (`t = r`), the decision-making changes to be more self-interested, reflecting the absence of future rounds to influence.
    *   If **at least one player defected** in the previous round (`t-1`), then **Defect (D)**.
    *   If **all players cooperated** in the previous round (`t-1`), then **Cooperate (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the last round, there's no incentive for future retaliation or cooperation. The strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by defecting if there's any indication of past defection, but will cooperate if the group has consistently cooperated until the end, aiming for the highest possible payoff in that final round.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **First Round (t = 1):** As stated above, always **Cooperate (C)**. This is a universal starting point designed to initiate a cooperative dynamic.

*   **Last Round (t = r):** The decision rules for the last round are specifically designed to adapt to the end of the game, as detailed in the "Responding to Defection in the Last Round" section above.

*   **All Players Defecting (t-1):** If all players defected in round `t-1`, the proportion of cooperators is 0, which is less than `k/n`. However, since 0% is less than 50%, the strategy will **Defect (D)** in round `t`. This is the correct response to a complete breakdown of cooperation.

*   **All Players Cooperating (t-1):** If all players cooperated in round `t-1`, the proportion of cooperators is 1 (or `n/n`). This is greater than or equal to `k/n` (since `k < n`, `k/n < 1`). Thus, the strategy will **Cooperate (C)** in round `t`.

### 3. Being Cooperative:

This strategy is inherently cooperative for the following reasons:

*   **Initial Cooperation:** The commitment to cooperate in the first round is a clear signal of intent to build a cooperative environment.
*   **Threshold-Based Cooperation:** The strategy promotes cooperation when collective benefits (`k/n` threshold) are achievable. This aligns with the game's design where collective contribution is more efficient than individual contribution when `k > 1`.
*   **Forgiving Nature:** The 50% threshold for continuing to cooperate even when the `k/n` threshold is not met allows for recovery from minor lapses in collective cooperation. This fosters a stable cooperative equilibrium rather than immediate punitive defection.
*   **Maximizing Collective Payoff:** By aiming to maintain cooperation when it's beneficial, the strategy seeks to maximize the total payoff for all players, which is the essence of cooperation in this game.
*   **Adaptive but Stable:** While adaptive to opponent behavior, the core preference is for cooperation, making it robust to a variety of strategies that might test cooperative boundaries. It punishes consistent defection but is resilient to occasional deviations.

## The "Exploiter's Edge" Strategy

This strategy is designed for aggressive maximization of individual payoff in the N-Player Public Goods Game. It prioritizes extracting value by defecting strategically, while maintaining a minimal level of cooperation only when it demonstrably benefits the player more than pure defection. The core principle is to **punish deviation from an idealized aggressive outcome and reward compliance with a slightly less aggressive outcome, always aiming to be the one benefiting from others' contributions.**

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect

The "Exploiter's Edge" strategy operates on a threshold-based system, heavily influenced by the player's immediate past payoff and the overall cooperation rate in the previous round.

**Primary Rule: Defect unless a clear, aggressive advantage exists for cooperation.**

*   **Default Action: DEFECT (D)**
    *   The strategy will *always* start by defecting. Cooperation is an exception, not the norm.

*   **Conditional Cooperation: COOPERATE (C)**
    *   **Condition 1: High Neighboring Cooperation & Favorable Personal Payoff in the Previous Round.**
        *   If, in the *previous round*, the number of cooperators was **greater than `n/2`** (meaning a majority cooperated) AND your personal payoff in the previous round was **above your own payoff from pure defection in that same round**, then *consider* cooperating.
        *   *Rationale:* This indicates a scenario where others are contributing significantly, and your cooperation, while reducing your private gain, leads to a net *increase* in your total payoff due to the multiplier effect. You are essentially piggybacking on others' efforts to amplify your gains.
    *   **Condition 2: The "Coercive Cooperation" Trigger (Aggressive Element).**
        *   If, in the *previous round*, the number of cooperators was **less than or equal to `n/2`** (meaning a minority or equal number cooperated) AND your personal payoff in the previous round was **below your own payoff from pure defection in that same round**, then **COOPERATE**.
        *   *Rationale:* This is the aggressive "punishment" and "coercion" mechanism. If the group is not cooperating enough to benefit you (even when you defect), you will *temporarily* cooperate to try and "drag" them up to a cooperative level where you can then exploit them more effectively in subsequent rounds. This is a risky move, as it incurs an immediate cost, but aims for a larger future reward by incentivizing others to cooperate more.

*   **The "Back to Defection" Rule:**
    *   If the conditions for cooperation are not met in the current round, the player will revert to **DEFECT**.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **Round 1 (The Opening Salvo): DEFECT (D)**
    *   The strategy always begins with pure defection. There is no history to analyze, and the primary objective is to immediately establish a self-interested stance and gauge the environment.

*   **The Last Round (The Final Score): DEFECT (D)**
    *   In the very last round, there is no future to influence or exploit. The strategy will always defect to maximize its immediate, final payoff, regardless of past history. There is no incentive to cooperate when there are no future rounds to reap the benefits of group cooperation.

*   **Early Rounds (Exploration and Exploitation):**
    *   The strategy will initially defect for several rounds to establish a baseline and observe the general behavior of other players.
    *   The "Coercive Cooperation" trigger will likely be more active in the early-to-mid game if other players are not cooperating sufficiently. This is where the strategy tries to shape the environment to its advantage.

### 3. Aggressiveness Manifested

*   **Default to Defection:** The most fundamental aggressive stance. The player assumes others will be self-interested and positions itself to benefit from their contributions.
*   **Conditional Cooperation as a Lever:** Cooperation is not altruistic. It's a tactical move used *only* when it demonstrably increases personal payoff (Condition 1) or when used as a short-term "punishment" to force others into more cooperative behavior (Condition 2).
*   **The "Coercive Cooperation" Trigger:** This is the most overtly aggressive element. It's a short-term sacrifice designed to extract more significant gains later by influencing the group's behavior. It's a "take one for the team, but only to make the team work harder for *me* later" approach.
*   **No Forgiveness for Low Cooperation:** The strategy is quick to revert to defection if cooperation levels don't yield sufficient personal benefits, even if it means sacrificing potential long-term gains from a consistently cooperative group. It's about maximizing gains in the current environment, not building trust.
*   **Exploiting the Majority:** The strategy thrives when a majority of players cooperate, allowing it to defect and receive a high payoff from the public good generated by others.

### Pseudocode Outline:

```
// Parameters: n, r, k

// Game state variables (to be maintained by the game environment):
// - history: A list of past rounds, where each round contains:
//    - my_action (C or D)
//    - opponent_actions (list of actions for other players)
//    - my_payoff_this_round
//    - num_cooperators_this_round

// Strategy function for player i:
function get_action(current_round, history):

    // Edge Case: First Round
    if current_round == 1:
        return D

    // Edge Case: Last Round
    if current_round == r:
        return D

    // Get data from the previous round
    previous_round_data = history[current_round - 1]
    my_previous_action = previous_round_data.my_action
    my_previous_payoff = previous_round_data.my_payoff_this_round
    num_cooperators_previous_round = previous_round_data.num_cooperators_this_round

    // Calculate hypothetical payoff from pure defection in the previous round
    hypothetical_pure_defection_payoff = 1 + (k / n) * (num_cooperators_previous_round - (1 if my_previous_action == C else 0)) // If I had defected, what would my payoff be?

    // Decision Logic

    // Condition 1: High Neighboring Cooperation & Favorable Personal Payoff
    if num_cooperators_previous_round > (n / 2) and my_previous_payoff > hypothetical_pure_defection_payoff:
        // Consider cooperating if past cooperation was beneficial AND majority cooperated
        // The actual decision to cooperate here would depend on a further check or a confidence level,
        // but for strict aggression, we'll lean towards defecting unless it's truly a huge win.
        // For "Exploiter's Edge", we only cooperate if it's a clear, defined win as per the rules.
        // This condition primarily serves as a check. The main aggressive driver is condition 2.
        // We might slightly adjust this for a more nuanced aggressive strategy, but sticking to the defined rules:
        // If this condition is met, it means previous cooperation was good. We still default to D unless Condition 2 forces C.
        // However, if the payoff WAS higher, we are already in a good position.

        // Let's refine this based on aggressive intent:
        // If majority cooperated AND my payoff was higher than if I had defected,
        // this is a stable, exploitable state. Continue to defect to maximize your individual gain.
        // Therefore, this condition doesn't directly lead to C in the current round for "Exploiter's Edge".
        // It's more of an observation that the current environment is favorable for continued defection.
        // If my_previous_action was C, I am already in a good state due to others' contributions.

        // The primary driver for cooperation is Condition 2.
        pass // Continue to default DEFECT unless Condition 2 applies.


    // Condition 2: The "Coercive Cooperation" Trigger
    if num_cooperators_previous_round <= (n / 2) and my_previous_payoff < hypothetical_pure_defection_payoff:
        // If the group isn't cooperating enough and I suffered from it, try to "force" cooperation.
        return C

    // Default to DEFECT if no cooperation condition is met
    return D

```

This strategy is designed to be a formidable opponent, consistently seeking to maximize its own gains by judiciously defecting and strategically employing cooperation as a tool for immediate or future advantage. It is a testament to a purely self-interested, "win-at-all-costs" mentality in the context of this game.
