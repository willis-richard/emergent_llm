The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC)", is designed to promote and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game by mirroring the observed collective behavior of other players, adapting to game dynamics, and anticipating the finite nature of the game.

### Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC) Strategy Description

This strategy depends on the game parameters (`n`, `r`, `k`) and the history of actions from all players.

#### 1. Decision Rules

**A. First Round (Round 1): Initiate Cooperation**

*   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
*   **Rationale:** The strategy begins by making a cooperative gesture. This serves as an initial signal of willingness to contribute to the public good and provides an opportunity for other players to reciprocate and establish a cooperative environment.

**B. Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1): Adaptive Reciprocity**

*   At the beginning of each intermediate round, the strategy analyzes the collective actions of all other players from the *immediately preceding round*.
*   **Calculate Others' Cooperation Rate:**
    *   Count the number of other players (excluding yourself) who chose to Contribute (C) in the previous round. Let this be `N_others_contributed`.
    *   Calculate the `CooperationRate_others = N_others_contributed / (n - 1)`. This value represents the proportion of your fellow players who contributed to the public good in the last round.
*   **Decision Based on Collective Cooperation:**
    *   **Cooperation Threshold (T):** This strategy uses a fixed threshold `T = 0.5`.
    *   If `CooperationRate_others >= T` (i.e., 50% or more of the other players contributed in the previous round):
        *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
        *   **Rationale:** If a sufficient level of collective cooperation is observed, the strategy rewards this behavior by continuing to contribute. This reinforces positive collective action and aims to sustain high overall payoffs.
    *   Else (`CooperationRate_others < T`):
        *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (contribute 0 tokens).
        *   **Rationale:** If the observed collective cooperation falls below the threshold, the strategy responds by defecting. This serves as a collective punishment for widespread free-riding, aiming to deter further declines in contributions and encourage a return to higher cooperation levels.

**C. Last Round (Round r): Rational Defection**

*   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)** (contribute 0 tokens).
*   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions or opportunities for further punishment or reward. According to backward induction, individual rationality dictates defection to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no consequences for future rounds. This is a common and robust strategy for the final round.

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round:** Explicitly covered (always Contribute).
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly covered (always Defect).
*   **Small `n` (e.g., `n=2`):** The calculation `N_others_contributed / (n - 1)` handles `n=2` correctly. In this case, `n-1 = 1`, and `CooperationRate_others` will be either 0 (if the other player defected) or 1 (if the other player contributed). The strategy effectively acts as a Tit-for-Tat in a 2-player game.
*   **Tournament Play without Shared Norms:** The strategy is entirely self-contained, requiring no communication or pre-agreed norms. It adapts solely based on observed past actions and the defined rules.

#### 3. Collective Alignment

This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** It initiates cooperation from the first round, demonstrating a willingness to contribute to the common good.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** It is designed to reward collective cooperation and penalize collective defection. This mechanism aims to steer the game towards the Pareto-optimal outcome where all players contribute and achieve higher payoffs (`k`) than the Nash Equilibrium of universal defection (`1`).
*   **Protection Against Exploitation:** By defecting when cooperation is insufficient, the strategy protects itself and the collective from being exploited by widespread free-riding, preventing the collapse of cooperation that would lead to suboptimal outcomes for everyone.
*   **Parameter-Agnostic (mostly):** While the threshold `T` is fixed, the strategy's logic scales with `n` and `r`, making it broadly applicable across different game parameters.

The following strategy, "Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperator" (ARC), is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the repeated Public Goods Game. It balances an initial commitment to collective welfare with adaptive responses to observed group behavior, ensuring robustness against exploitation while striving for optimal outcomes for the group.

---

### **Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperator (ARC) Strategy**

This strategy operates based on the round number and the observed level of cooperation in the previous round. It aims to achieve and maintain a high level of collective contribution by initiating cooperation, rewarding sustained group contributions, and penalizing insufficient contributions.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Stance):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy begins with an act of cooperation to signal a willingness to build collective welfare and establish a cooperative environment. This is a necessary first step for a collective strategy to encourage others to contribute.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`):**
    *   **Information:** At the start of round `t` (where `1 < t < r`), observe `C_prev`, the total number of players who contributed in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   **Decision Criterion:** Calculate `MinCooperators`, the minimum number of cooperators required for the public good to, on average, return at least the value of a single contribution to the group.
        *   `MinCooperators = ceil(n / k)`
        *   *(Note: Since `1 < k < n`, `n/k` will always be greater than 1. `MinCooperators` will therefore be at least 2, representing a substantial threshold.)*
    *   **Rule:**
        *   **If `C_prev >= MinCooperators`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** The group's previous contribution level was sufficient, meaning that the average return from the public good for contributing players was at least 1 unit. This indicates a healthy level of cooperation, justifying continued contribution to reinforce positive behavior and aim for higher collective payoffs.
        *   **Else (`C_prev < MinCooperators`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** The group's previous contribution level was too low, suggesting insufficient cooperation or potential exploitation. Defecting in this scenario serves as a proportional response, a signal that the current level of cooperation is unsustainable, and a protective measure against continued exploitation.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. The game effectively reverts to a single-round Public Goods Game, where defection becomes the dominant strategy for all rational players. This action anticipates universal rational behavior and prevents exploitation in the terminal round.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
The strategy inherently handles the first and last rounds as distinct phases with specific rules. The intermediate rounds are governed by an adaptive threshold derived directly from game parameters (`n` and `k`), which adjusts dynamically to the observed collective behavior.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
*   **Initial Cooperation:** The strategy starts by cooperating, demonstrating a commitment to the collective good from the outset.
*   **Sustainability Threshold:** The `MinCooperators` threshold (`ceil(n/k)`) is designed to ensure that the collective contributions are generating a sufficient return to the group, making cooperation collectively "worthwhile" beyond individual incentives. This directly promotes a level of contribution that benefits the group.
*   **Reciprocity for Group Health:** By rewarding sufficient group cooperation and punishing insufficient cooperation, the strategy aims to guide the collective towards a high-cooperation equilibrium, rather than simply maximizing individual short-term gains (except in the final round, where future incentives cease). It is a strategy for a player who wants the group to succeed in cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_3 = '''
This strategy is called **Adaptive Collective Reciprocation (ACR)**. It is designed to foster and sustain cooperation within the group by adapting to observed collective behavior, while being robust to a variety of opponent strategies.

---

### Adaptive Collective Reciprocation (ACR) Strategy Description

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1: Initial Outreach (Always Contribute)**
    *   In the very first round, the player always **Contributes (C)** one token.
    *   *Rationale:* This serves as an initial gesture of trust and a clear signal of willingness to cooperate. It allows for the establishment of a cooperative equilibrium from the outset.

*   **Rounds 2 to `r` (inclusive): Conditional Reciprocation**
    *   At the beginning of each round from the second until the last, the player observes the total number of contributions made by all players (including oneself) in the *immediately preceding round*. Let this be denoted as `C_prev`.
    *   **Cooperation Threshold Calculation:**
        *   Calculate the **Cooperation Threshold `T` = `ceil(n / 2)`**. This threshold represents a simple majority of players. For example, if `n=5`, `T=3`; if `n=4`, `T=2`.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `C_prev >= T` (Sufficient Collective Cooperation):** The player **Contributes (C)** one token.
            *   *Rationale:* If at least a simple majority of players (including oneself) contributed in the previous round, it indicates a sufficient level of collective effort. The strategy reciprocates this positive collective behavior to reinforce cooperation and sustain mutual benefit.
        *   **If `C_prev < T` (Insufficient Collective Cooperation):** The player **Defects (D)**, contributing zero tokens and keeping their endowment.
            *   *Rationale:* If fewer than a simple majority of players contributed, it signals a significant breakdown in collective action or attempts at widespread free-riding. The strategy responds by defecting to protect itself from exploitation and to signal to others that higher levels of contribution are required to maintain cooperation.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (`r=1`):** As specified, the player always **Contributes (C)**.
*   **Last Round (`r`):** The strategy applies the *same conditional reciprocation rules* as for intermediate rounds. It *does not* automatically defect due to the standard backward induction argument common in finite repeated games.
    *   *Rationale:* This decision aligns with the "collective mindset" and "robustness" requirements. Assuming all other AI agents will perfectly backward induct and defect in the final rounds is not robust in a tournament against heterogeneous strategies. By maintaining its conditional cooperation, this strategy keeps open the possibility of sustained collective welfare until the very end, especially against opponents who do not backward induct. If collective cooperation has been strong in the penultimate round, this strategy will continue to contribute in the final round, aiming to maximize overall group payoff. If cooperation has broken down earlier, the strategy will defect accordingly.
*   **Small `n` values (e.g., `n=2`, `n=3`):** The `ceil(n/2)` threshold adapts gracefully.
    *   For `n=2`, `T = ceil(2/2) = 1`. This means if at least one player (which could be oneself) contributed, the strategy contributes. This makes it a relatively "generous" strategy for two-player games, willing to give the other player a chance to cooperate even after a defection, aiming to re-establish cooperation.
    *   For `n=3`, `T = ceil(3/2) = 2`. If at least two players contributed, the strategy contributes. This provides a balanced approach for small groups.

**3. Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

*   **Promotes Cooperation:** ACR is designed from the ground up to initiate and sustain collective cooperation, which is the primary driver of overall welfare in the Public Goods Game.
*   **Reciprocation as a Core Principle:** By conditioning its actions on the group's previous behavior, the strategy actively rewards collective effort and punishes widespread defection, steering the group towards higher contributions.
*   **Robustness for Collective Good:** The choice not to automatically defect in the final round reflects a commitment to collective benefit, even when individual short-term incentives might suggest otherwise. This makes the strategy more robust in a tournament setting where opponents may not be perfectly rational or may have different end-game considerations, thus preserving the potential for higher collective payoffs across all rounds.
*   **Clear and Understandable Rules:** The simple majority threshold provides a transparent basis for collective decision-making, which can be implicitly understood and responded to by other adaptive agents.

This strategy is designed to promote and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game, balancing the collective good with the need for self-protection against free-riders in a tournament setting. It is adaptive, relying on past actions, and robust across varying game parameters and opponent behaviors.

### **Adaptive Conditional Cooperator Strategy**

**Overview:**
This strategy aims to establish and maintain a high level of cooperation by starting cooperatively and then conditionally adapting its behavior based on the collective actions of all players in the previous round. It implements a form of reciprocal cooperation, forgiving minor defections but retaliating against significant drops in collective contributions. It also accounts for the finite nature of the game through backward induction.

**Strategy Details:**

1.  **Initial Round (Round 1, t=1):**
    *   **If `r = 1`** (i.e., this is a single-round game):
        *   **Defect (D)**. In a one-shot Public Goods Game, defection is the dominant strategy.
    *   **Else (`r > 1`)**:
        *   **Contribute (C)**. Start by cooperating to signal a willingness to collaborate and to provide an opportunity for collective cooperation to emerge. This acts as an initial investment in potential collective welfare.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to `r-1`, i.e., `1 < t < r`):**
    *   **Observe Past Round:** At the beginning of each intermediate round, analyze the actions of all `n` players from the *immediately preceding round (t-1)*.
    *   **Calculate Cooperation Count:** Determine `C_prev`, which is the total number of players who **Contributed (C)** in round `t-1`.
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   **If `C_prev >= floor(n * 0.7)`:**
            *   **Contribute (C)**. This strategy cooperates if a sufficiently high proportion (at least 70%) of players contributed in the previous round. This threshold allows for a degree of forgiveness, tolerating minor defections (up to 30% of players) without immediately retaliating, thereby promoting stability and resilience of cooperation.
        *   **Else (if `C_prev < floor(n * 0.7)`):**
            *   **Defect (D)**. If cooperation levels fall below the threshold, the strategy switches to defection. This serves as a collective punishment mechanism, signaling that insufficient contributions will not be tolerated and incentivizing other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds.

3.  **Final Round (Round `r`, t=r):**
    *   **Defect (D)**. Regardless of past history, in the final round of a finitely repeated game, there are no future interactions to influence. Therefore, the individually rational choice is to defect, consistent with backward induction.

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_5 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Reciprocator with Forgiveness" (ARF), aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It operates on the principle of conditional cooperation, adapting its behavior based on the observed actions of other players to encourage higher overall contributions while protecting itself from exploitation.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for the common pool (1 < k < n).

**Internal State:**
*   `Current_Stance`: This variable tracks the strategy's current disposition. It can be either "Cooperating" or "Defecting". Initially, `Current_Stance` is set to "Cooperating".

**Strategic Thresholds:**
*   **`Cooperation_Sustain_Threshold (CST)`**: A fractional value (e.g., `0.5`). If the proportion of players who contributed in the previous round falls *below* this threshold, ARF will switch its `Current_Stance` to "Defecting" and contribute 0.
*   **`Cooperation_Rebound_Threshold (CRT)`**: A fractional value (e.g., `0.75`). If ARF is currently in the "Defecting" `Current_Stance`, it will only return to "Cooperating" if the proportion of players who contributed in the previous round meets or *exceeds* this higher threshold.

**Recommended Default Thresholds:**
*   `CST = 0.5` (i.e., if less than 50% of players cooperated in the last round, switch to defecting).
*   `CRT = 0.75` (i.e., if currently defecting, at least 75% of players must cooperate in the last round to switch back to cooperating).

---

**Decision Rules (for player `i` in round `t`):**

1.  **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)** (1 token).
    *   **Rationale:** Initiate cooperation and signal a willingness to contribute to the collective good. This sets a positive precedent.

2.  **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)** (0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finitely repeated game, the individually rational choice is to free-ride, as there are no subsequent rounds to influence or be influenced by. This prevents exploitation in the endgame.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**

    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t`, observe the actions of all `n` players from the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   Count the number of players who contributed in round `t-1`, let this be `N_cooperators_prev`.
    *   Calculate the `Proportion_Cooperators_prev = N_cooperators_prev / n`.

    *   **Decision Based on `Current_Stance`:**

        *   **If `Current_Stance` is "Cooperating":**
            *   **Condition:** If `Proportion_Cooperators_prev >= CST`
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)** (1 token).
                *   **Rationale:** A sufficient level of cooperation was maintained in the previous round. Continue to contribute to sustain the collective benefit.
            *   **Condition:** Else (`Proportion_Cooperators_prev < CST`)
                *   **Action: Defect (D)** (0 tokens).
                *   **Update `Current_Stance` to "Defecting".**
                *   **Rationale:** Too many players free-rode in the previous round. This punishes non-cooperators and protects the player's endowment from excessive exploitation, signaling that low cooperation is unsustainable.

        *   **If `Current_Stance` is "Defecting":**
            *   **Condition:** If `Proportion_Cooperators_prev >= CRT`
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)** (1 token).
                *   **Update `Current_Stance` to "Cooperating".**
                *   **Rationale:** A strong signal of renewed and widespread cooperation has been observed (meeting the higher `CRT`). Be willing to return to contributing to rebuild trust and re-establish the collective good.
            *   **Condition:** Else (`Proportion_Cooperators_prev < CRT`)
                *   **Action: Defect (D)** (0 tokens).
                *   **Rationale:** Cooperation levels are still too low for a safe return to contributing. Continue to defect as a signal that more consistent cooperation is required.

---

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**
This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Starting with a contribution to signal a desire for collective welfare.
*   **Sustaining Cooperation:** Continuing to contribute as long as a reasonable level of collective effort is observed.
*   **Punishing Free-Riding:** Temporarily defecting when too many players free-ride, which is a necessary mechanism to prevent the erosion of the public good in repeated interactions.
*   **Offering Forgiveness:** Providing a clear, albeit higher, threshold (`CRT`) for re-engaging in cooperation, allowing for the re-establishment of collective effort after breakdowns.
*   **Robustness:** The adaptive nature allows it to perform well against a variety of opponent strategies, from pure cooperators to pure defectors, by reacting to actual play rather than relying on assumed norms.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_6 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**, aims to foster and sustain high levels of collective cooperation by adaptively adjusting its expectations of group contributions and responding reciprocally. It prioritizes maximizing overall group welfare over the long term, while protecting itself from persistent exploitation.

---

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: number of players
*   `k`: multiplier for contributions (with the condition `1 < k < n`)
*   `r`: total number of rounds

**History Tracking:**
*   After each round `t-1`, the strategy observes the total number of players who contributed, denoted as `N_C_prev`.

**Internal State Variable:**
*   `current_cooperation_level_target`: A floating-point number between `k/n` and `1.0` (inclusive). This represents the minimum proportion of total players (from 0.0 to 1.0) that this strategy expects to contribute for it to continue cooperating.

---

**Decision Rules:**

**1. Round 1 (Initialization Phase):**
    *   **If `r = 1`** (a single-round game):
        *   Choose **Defect (D)**.
        (Rationale: In a one-shot Public Goods Game, defection is the individually dominant strategy as there are no future interactions to consider.)
    *   **Otherwise (`r > 1`)** (a repeated game):
        *   Choose **Contribute (C)**.
        (Rationale: An optimistic start signals willingness to cooperate and explores the group's potential for collective action, which is crucial for establishing cooperation in repeated games.)
    *   Initialize `current_cooperation_level_target = 0.5`.
        (Rationale: A moderate initial expectation, balancing optimism with pragmatism. This target will dynamically adjust based on actual group behavior.)

**2. Rounds `t` from 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Play Phase):**
    Let `N_C_prev` be the total number of players who contributed in the previous round (`t-1`).
    Let `actual_cooperation_proportion_prev = N_C_prev / n`.

    **A. Adjust `current_cooperation_level_target`:**
    *   **If `actual_cooperation_proportion_prev >= current_cooperation_level_target`:**
        *   (The group met or exceeded our target.) **Reward** by slightly increasing the target, encouraging higher levels of future cooperation.
        *   Update: `current_cooperation_level_target = min(1.0, current_cooperation_level_target + (1.0 - current_cooperation_level_target) * 0.1)`
        (Rationale: This increases the target by 10% of the remaining gap towards full cooperation (1.0). It's a slow, steady push towards maximal collective contribution.)
    *   **Else (`actual_cooperation_proportion_prev < current_cooperation_level_target`):**
        *   (The group failed to meet our target.) **Penalize** by slightly decreasing the target, reflecting lower expectations and potentially leading to defection.
        *   Update: `current_cooperation_level_target = max(k / n, current_cooperation_level_target - (current_cooperation_level_target - k/n) * 0.2)`
        (Rationale: This decreases the target by 20% of the gap between the current target and the minimum feasible level of cooperation (`k/n`). This allows for a quicker, but not irreversible, response to low cooperation. The lower bound `k/n` prevents the strategy from setting an unrealistically low target; if the average contribution return is less than `k/n`, cooperation is extremely unfavorable.)

    **B. Determine Action for Current Round `t`:**
    *   **If `actual_cooperation_proportion_prev >= current_cooperation_level_target`:**
        *   Choose **Contribute (C)**.
        (Rationale: Continue to support collective efforts as expectations are being met or exceeded, reinforcing positive feedback.)
    *   **Else (`actual_cooperation_proportion_prev < current_cooperation_level_target`):**
        *   Choose **Defect (D)**.
        (Rationale: Withdraw support due to insufficient collective effort in the previous round, acting as a reciprocal punishment for defection.)

**3. Round `t = r` (Final Round - Endgame Phase):**
    *   Regardless of past history or the `current_cooperation_level_target`:
        *   Choose **Defect (D)**.
        (Rationale: In the final round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. Backward induction dictates that the individually rational strategy of defection prevails.)

---

**Alignment with Task Requirements:**

*   **1. Specify decision rules:** Clearly defined for all phases based on `N_C_prev` and the adaptive `current_cooperation_level_target`.
*   **2. Handle edge cases:** Explicit rules for the first round (`r=1` vs. `r>1`) and the last round (`t=r`).
*   **3. Be collective:**
    *   The strategy starts cooperatively to initiate collective action.
    *   It continuously attempts to raise the `current_cooperation_level_target`, striving for higher group contributions and, consequently, greater collective welfare (as `k > 1`).
    *   Its responses are based on the overall `actual_cooperation_proportion_prev` of the group, not just individual actions, making it a truly collective strategy.
    *   By punishing insufficient cooperation, it aims to deter free-riding and guide the group towards more cooperative equilibria.
*   **Adaptive and Robust:**
    *   **Adaptation:** The `current_cooperation_level_target` dynamically adjusts to observed group behavior, allowing the strategy to learn and react to different opponents and game dynamics.
    *   **Robustness:** It protects against exploitation by defecting when cooperation levels are low. Its adaptive nature also allows for forgiveness and re-establishment of cooperation if group behavior improves, preventing permanent breakdown. The `k/n` floor ensures a minimal expectation for group cooperation, preventing total capitulation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_7 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Reciprocal Group Contributor," is designed to foster collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game by adaptively responding to the group's observed behavior while ensuring its own robustness against exploitation, particularly in the critical final round. It balances the collective good with individual self-preservation in a competitive tournament environment.

**Strategy Parameters:**

*   **`initial_cooperation_threshold_rate`**: A float (between 0 and 1) representing the baseline proportion of contributions from the group required for this strategy to contribute. A value of `0.5` is a balanced starting point, assuming no prior knowledge of group generosity.
*   **`learning_rate`**: A small positive float (e.g., `0.1`) that determines how quickly the `current_cooperation_threshold_rate` adjusts.
*   **`min_threshold_rate`**: A minimum bound for `current_cooperation_threshold_rate` (e.g., `0.1`).
*   **`max_threshold_rate`**: A maximum bound for `current_cooperation_threshold_rate` (e.g., `0.9`).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initiation Phase):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This acts as an initial overture, signaling a willingness to cooperate and testing the group's responsiveness. It sets a positive tone for potential collective welfare.
    *   *Initialization:* Set `current_cooperation_threshold_rate` to `initial_cooperation_threshold_rate`.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round `t` where `1 < t < r`):**
    *   **Observation:** After round `t-1`, calculate the `observed_group_cooperation_rate`. This is the total number of contributions in round `t-1` divided by the total number of players (`n`).
        `observed_group_cooperation_rate = (sum of all players' contributions in round t-1) / n`
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `observed_group_cooperation_rate` is greater than or equal to `current_cooperation_threshold_rate`:
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* The group's observed cooperation level meets or exceeds the strategy's current expectation. Continue to contribute to reinforce and maintain collective welfare.
        *   Else (if `observed_group_cooperation_rate` is less than `current_cooperation_threshold_rate`):
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* The group is not sufficiently cooperative to warrant continued contribution. Defect to avoid being exploited and to signal a demand for greater collective action from the group.
    *   **Adaptation of `current_cooperation_threshold_rate` (for the *next* round):**
        *   If `observed_group_cooperation_rate` was *higher* than `current_cooperation_threshold_rate`:
            *   `current_cooperation_threshold_rate = max(min_threshold_rate, current_cooperation_threshold_rate - learning_rate)`
            *   *Rationale:* The group was more cooperative than anticipated. The strategy adjusts its threshold downwards, becoming more forgiving and more willing to cooperate in subsequent rounds. This rewards collective generosity.
        *   Else if `observed_group_cooperation_rate` was *lower* than `current_cooperation_threshold_rate`:
            *   `current_cooperation_threshold_rate = min(max_threshold_rate, current_cooperation_threshold_rate + learning_rate)`
            *   *Rationale:* The group was less cooperative than anticipated. The strategy adjusts its threshold upwards, becoming less forgiving and demanding a higher level of cooperation to contribute in subsequent rounds. This punishes collective selfishness.
        *   Else (if `observed_group_cooperation_rate` was *equal* to `current_cooperation_threshold_rate`):
            *   The `current_cooperation_threshold_rate` remains unchanged.

3.  **Final Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In a finite repeated game, the dominant strategy for the final round is to defect, as there are no future interactions or reputation effects to consider. While the strategy embodies a collective mindset, this specific edge case necessitates self-preservation in a tournament where other agents are likely to defect. This protects the strategy from being a "sucker" in the closing moments of the game.

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** Initiates cooperation in the first round to build trust and demonstrate willingness for collective benefit.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** Evaluates and responds to the group's overall cooperation. It aims to contribute when there's sufficient collective effort, thereby promoting sustainable cooperation.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Dynamically adjusts its expectations of group cooperation based on observed history, fostering long-term collective success in varying environments.
*   **Strategic Robustness:** While prioritizing collective welfare, the strategy includes a game-theoretically sound defection in the final round to prevent exploitation, acknowledging the competitive tournament context.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**

**Game Parameters:** `n` (number of players), `r` (number of rounds), `k` (multiplier)

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **If `r = 1` (Single Round Game):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In a single-round Public Goods Game, defection is the dominant strategy for individual payoff maximization, as there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation or punish non-cooperation.

2.  **If `r > 1` (Repeated Game):**

    *   **Round 1 (Initial Commitment):**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   **Reasoning:** Begin with a contribution to signal a willingness to cooperate and to "test the waters" for reciprocal behavior from other players. This establishes a positive initial collective intent.

    *   **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Reciprocity Phase):**
        *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t` (for `2 <= t < r`), observe the actions of all players from the immediately preceding round `t-1`.
        *   **Calculate Average Contribution Rate (ACR):**
            *   `ACR = (Sum of all players' contributions in round t-1) / n`
            *   *(This represents the proportion of players who contributed in the previous round.)*
        *   **Set Cooperation Threshold (T):**
            *   `T = 1 / k`
            *   *(Note: Given `1 < k < n`, the threshold `T` will always be a value between `1/n` and `1` (exclusive).)*
            *   **Rationale for T:** This threshold dynamically adjusts to the efficiency of the public good.
                *   If `k` is high (meaning the public good is very efficient, and individual contributions generate substantial collective benefits), `T` will be low. This makes the strategy more "forgiving," requiring a lower average contribution rate from others to continue cooperating.
                *   If `k` is low (meaning the public good is less efficient, and collective benefits are modest), `T` will be high. This demands a higher average contribution rate from others to justify continued cooperation.
        *   **Decision:**
            *   If `ACR >= T`: Contribute (C).
            *   If `ACR < T`: Defect (D).
        *   **Reasoning:** This is the core adaptive mechanism designed to foster collective welfare. The strategy reciprocates observed levels of cooperation, contributing when the collective effort is deemed sufficiently high (based on the `1/k` threshold) and pulling back (defecting) when cooperation is insufficient to make the collective endeavor worthwhile or when exploitation is detected. This prevents persistent exploitation while enabling robust cooperation under favorable conditions.

    *   **Round `r` (End-Game Protection):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Reasoning:** In the absolute final round of a finite repeated game, the incentive structure reverts to that of a single-round game. There are no subsequent rounds in which to reward cooperation or punish defection. Therefore, individual rationality dictates defection to maximize payoff and prevent being exploited by other players who will also rationally defect.

Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Cooperation (ACC)

The Adaptive Collective Cooperation (ACC) strategy is designed to foster and sustain group-wide cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It operates on principles of initial benevolence, conditional reciprocity based on group behavior, and rational adaptation to finite game conditions. The strategy aims to maximize collective welfare while remaining robust against exploitation.

---

### 1. Decision Rules

The decision to Contribute (C) or Defect (D) in any given round `t` (from 1 to `r`) is determined as follows:

*   **Round 1 (Initial Gesture):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy begins with an act of cooperation to signal its willingness to contribute to the common good and to test the cooperative inclination of other players. This establishes a foundation for potential collective benefit.

*   **Rounds `t` from 2 to `r-1` (Conditional Reciprocity):**
    *   **Observation:** At the start of round `t`, the strategy observes the actions of all `n` players from the *immediately preceding round* (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculation:**
        1.  Count the total number of players who contributed in round `t-1`: `N_cooperators_prev = sum_j c_j_prev`.
        2.  Calculate the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1`: `P_cooperators_prev = N_cooperators_prev / n`.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `P_cooperators_prev >= 0.5` (Majority Rule):** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If a majority (50% or more) of players demonstrated cooperation in the previous round, the strategy reciprocates by contributing. This reinforces collective action, rewards group effort, and sustains the potential for high group payoffs.
        *   **Else (If `P_cooperators_prev < 0.5`):** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If less than a majority of players contributed, indicating a lack of collective effort or potential free-riding, the strategy defects. This serves as a collective "punishment" mechanism, signaling that individual defection will not be tolerated and that continued cooperation requires a significant group commitment. It protects the strategy from sustained exploitation.

*   **Round `r` (Last Round - Terminal Rationality):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to influence. The incentives to maintain reputation or engage in punishment/reward cease to exist. Therefore, defection becomes the individually rational and robust choice to maximize one's own payoff in this terminal round, regardless of prior group behavior.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round (`t=1`):** Explicitly handled by contributing (C) to initiate collective action.
*   **Last Round (`t=r`):** Explicitly handled by defecting (D) due to the absence of future interactions and the corresponding breakdown of reputation-based incentives.
*   **Intermediate Rounds (`t=2` to `r-1`):** These rounds are covered by the conditional reciprocity rule, which dynamically adapts behavior based on the observed group cooperation level from the previous round.

### 3. Collective Mindset Alignment

The Adaptive Collective Cooperation strategy embodies a collective mindset through the following principles:

*   **Initiation of Collective Good:** By starting with a contribution, the strategy actively attempts to seed cooperation and establish a foundation for collective welfare.
*   **Promotion of Conditional Cooperation:** The core decision rule based on a 50% cooperation threshold directly encourages mutual cooperation. It rewards strong collective contributions and signals disapproval for widespread defection, aiming to guide the group towards a high-cooperation equilibrium.
*   **Robustness Against Exploitation:** While striving for collective good, the strategy is not naive. It protects itself from being consistently exploited by free-riders by defecting when group cooperation falls below a critical level, ensuring the sustainability of its cooperative stance.
*   **Simplicity and Predictability:** The clear and consistent rules, particularly the fixed 0.5 threshold, make the strategy relatively easy to understand and potentially predictable by other rational agents. This can facilitate the emergence of stable cooperative patterns within the group, ultimately benefiting all players.

This strategy, named "Adaptive Trust Builder," aims to maximize collective welfare by proactively fostering cooperation while remaining robust against exploitation. It adapts its behavior based on the observed cooperation level of other players, with a bias towards promoting trust and collaboration.

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Trust Builder

**Goal:** Achieve and sustain high collective contribution levels, thereby maximizing overall payoffs for the group, while protecting against persistent free-riding.

**Game Parameters (available to the strategy):**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Internal State (for this player's internal use):**
*   `current_round_number`: Tracks the current round (from 1 to `r`).

**Fixed Thresholds (calibrated for general robustness):**
*   `Threshold_High_Cooperation = 0.7` (If 70% or more of others contributed)
*   `Threshold_Low_Cooperation = 0.3` (If 30% or less of others contributed)
*   `Threshold_Moderate_Cooperation_Forgiveness = 0.5` (If 50% or more of others contributed in the moderate range)

---

**Decision Rules (Action for Player i in Round `t`):**

1.  **First Round (`t = 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Initiate the game with a clear signal of willingness to cooperate. This proactive contribution establishes an initial trust and provides an opportunity for the group to realize the benefits of collective action.

2.  **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In a finite repeated game, the "shadow of the future" vanishes in the final round. Rational players will defect to maximize their immediate payoff without fear of future retaliation. Defecting in the last round prevents exploitation by other strategies that will also rationally defect.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t < r`):**
    *   **Observation:** After round `t-1`, observe the contribution action (`c_j_{t-1}` in `{0,1}`) of every other player `j`.
    *   **Calculation:** Calculate the average contribution rate of all *other* players in the *previous* round:
        `avg_others_c = (sum_{j!=i} c_j_{t-1}) / (n-1)`

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `avg_others_c >= Threshold_High_Cooperation`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** Reward high levels of cooperation. When the group demonstrates strong collective behavior, continue to contribute to maintain and reinforce this positive dynamic, ensuring high collective payoffs.

        *   **Else If `avg_others_c <= Threshold_Low_Cooperation`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** Protect against widespread free-riding and signal that a very low level of cooperation is unacceptable. This serves as a strong punitive measure to discourage exploitative behavior and encourage a return to cooperation.

        *   **Else (i.e., `Threshold_Low_Cooperation < avg_others_c < Threshold_High_Cooperation` - Moderate Cooperation):**
            *   *This is the adaptive and forgiving zone, where the strategy attempts to steer the group towards higher cooperation.*
            *   **If `avg_others_c >= Threshold_Moderate_Cooperation_Forgiveness`:**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** If a significant portion of the group (at least 50% here) is cooperating, demonstrate generosity and continue to cooperate. This aims to reinforce positive behavior, forgive minor deviations, and gently guide the group towards full cooperation.
            *   **Else (`avg_others_c < Threshold_Moderate_Cooperation_Forgiveness`):**
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** If cooperation is still below a moderate, fair threshold, maintain a cautious stance by defecting. This acts as a milder corrective punishment to prevent further decline and incentivize an increase in contributions from other players.

---

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** Starts by cooperating to initiate collective benefit, taking the first step towards a positive outcome.
*   **Rewarding Reciprocity:** Explicitly contributes when others are highly cooperative, directly supporting the collective good.
*   **Forgiveness and Nudging:** The strategy incorporates a forgiving aspect (contributing even when group cooperation isn't perfect, as long as it's above 50%) to encourage positive trends and build trust. This is crucial for navigating dynamic group behaviors and moving towards higher collective welfare.
*   **Strategic Punishment:** Defection is used judiciously as a response to low cooperation, not as an initial stance. This aims to deter free-riding and guide the group back towards cooperative norms, thereby safeguarding the collective interest.
*   **Balanced Pragmatism:** The last-round defection acknowledges the game's mechanics while preserving the benefits of cooperation for as long as possible, striking a balance between collective goals and individual rationality in a tournament setting.

This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**, aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation while being robust against exploitation. It operates on the principle of group-level conditional cooperation, seeking to maintain collective welfare by adapting its behavior based on the overall contribution level of the group in the previous round.

---

### Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR) Strategy

This strategy depends on the game parameters `n` (number of players), `r` (number of rounds), and `k` (multiplier), and the history of actions.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Play):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   **Rationale:** Begin with cooperation to signal willingness to contribute to the common good and to encourage other players to do the same. This sets a positive tone for potential collective welfare.

*   **Rounds 2 through `r-1` (Adaptive Play):**
    *   After each round `t-1`, observe the actions of all `n` players. Calculate the **Total Contributions in the Previous Round (`S_prev`)**, which is the sum of `c_j` for all players `j` in round `t-1`.

    *   **Decision Rule for Round `t`:**
        *   **If `S_prev >= k`:** **Contribute (C).**
            *   **Rationale:** If the total contributions from the previous round meet or exceed the multiplier `k`, it signifies that the collective effort is sufficient to generate a meaningful shared benefit. This strategy rewards the group for maintaining a healthy level of cooperation by continuing to contribute. The threshold `k` ensures that individual contributions are generating a pool substantial enough to be considered a collective success.
        *   **If `S_prev < k`:** **Defect (D).**
            *   **Rationale:** If the total contributions fall below the threshold `k`, it indicates insufficient collective cooperation. In this scenario, the strategy defects to avoid being exploited by free-riders and to signal that the current level of group contribution is not sustainable or mutually beneficial. This acts as a collective "punishment" mechanism to incentivize higher contributions in subsequent rounds.

*   **Round `r` (Final Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there is no future play to incentivize cooperation (the "shadow of the future" disappears). The individually rational action is to defect to maximize one's own payoff, regardless of previous rounds' outcomes. This prevents exploitation by opponents who would inevitably defect in the final round.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (`t=1`):** Always cooperates (C) to initiate collective play.
*   **Last Round (`t=r`):** Always defects (D) due to the endgame effect.
*   **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t < r`):** Decisions are made adaptively based on the previous round's total contributions relative to the `k` threshold.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** Starts with a contribution to actively pursue collective welfare from the outset.
*   **Group-Oriented Threshold:** The decision to cooperate or defect is based on the *overall group performance* (`S_prev`) rather than specific individual actions. This promotes collective stability by tolerating some individual defection as long as the group's total contribution remains strong (`S_prev >= k`).
*   **Adaptive for Collective Good:** By having a threshold that triggers defection only when collective contributions are significantly low, the strategy seeks to guide the group back towards higher cooperation levels, rather than retaliating against single instances of defection. It aims to prevent a downward spiral triggered by individual retribution, unless the collective effort clearly fails.
*   **Protects Against Systemic Exploitation:** While forgiving of minor lapses, it protects against sustained, widespread free-riding by defecting when the overall contribution falls below a critical level. This ensures that the strategy is not a "sucker" that perpetually contributes without sufficient group reciprocation.

description_COLLECTIVE_12 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Reciprocity with Majority Rule," aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by responding to the group's overall behavior. It balances the desire for collective welfare with the need for individual protection against exploitation, adapting its actions based on observed contributions while accounting for the game's boundaries.

**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with Majority Rule**

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Play):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   *Rationale:* Start cooperatively to signal willingness to contribute and to explore the initial intentions of other players. This sets a positive precedent.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 up to Round r-1):**
    *   **Observe Past Actions:** Count `N_C_prev`, the total number of players who contributed (chose C) in the immediately preceding round.
    *   **Decision Threshold:**
        *   **If `N_C_prev >= n / 2` (at least half of the players contributed in the previous round):**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   *Rationale:* A significant portion of the group is demonstrating cooperation. By contributing, this strategy reciprocates positive collective behavior, reinforcing cooperation and maintaining momentum towards higher collective welfare.
        *   **Else (`N_C_prev < n / 2` - fewer than half of the players contributed in the previous round):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   *Rationale:* Insufficient collective effort. This strategy defects to penalize free-riding and low cooperation levels. The aim is to deter further defection and encourage other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds, thereby nudging the group back towards mutual cooperation.

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. The dominant strategy for a single round applies, as there are no repercussions for defection. Contributing would only lead to individual exploitation.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by always contributing to initiate cooperation.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by always defecting to prevent exploitation due to the lack of future interactions.
*   **Small `n` (e.g., `n=2`):** The `N_C_prev >= n/2` rule simplifies to `N_C_prev >= 1`. This means if at least one player (which would be the other player in a 2-player game) contributed, this strategy contributes. This is essentially a Tit-for-Tat variant, which is highly robust for `n=2`.
*   **Odd `n`:** The `n/2` threshold means `N_C_prev` must be greater than or equal to `ceil(n/2)` for cooperation (e.g., if `n=3`, `N_C_prev >= 1.5` implies `N_C_prev >= 2`). This correctly establishes a clear majority requirement.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

This strategy prioritizes collective welfare by actively working to establish and maintain a high level of group contribution.
*   It starts cooperatively to initiate a positive collective dynamic.
*   It rewards collective effort (when a majority contributes) by continuing to contribute, aiming to sustain the public good.
*   It punishes collective defection (when a majority defects) to prevent exploitation and to encourage a re-evaluation of strategies by other players, ultimately seeking to steer the group back towards a more cooperative equilibrium that benefits all.
*   The only exception is the final round defection, which is a necessary individual protection against exploitation when collective enforcement mechanisms (future rounds) cease to exist.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_13 = '''
**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Enforcement (ACE)**

**Core Principle:** This strategy aims to establish and maintain a high level of cooperation by demonstrating initial trust and then enforcing a minimum standard of collective contribution. It is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors, adapt to observed group actions, and account for the finite nature of the game.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier for public good (where `1 < k < n`)

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initialization):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Begin by signaling a strong willingness to cooperate. This provides the group with an immediate opportunity to achieve the highest possible collective payoff and sets a cooperative tone for the game.

2.  **Rounds `t` from 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Enforcement Phase):**
    *   **Information:** Observe `C_prev`, the total number of players who contributed in the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   **Cooperation Threshold Calculation:** Determine the `Sustainability_Threshold (S_T)`. This threshold represents the minimum number of cooperators required for the total collective benefit generated by the public good to be at least equal to the sum of individual default payoffs (i.e., if everyone defected and kept their endowment).
        `S_T = ceil(n / k)`
        *(Note: `ceil()` means "round up to the nearest whole number". For example, if `n/k` is 3.3, `S_T` is 4; if `n/k` is 3.0, `S_T` is 3.)*
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `C_prev >= S_T`:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** The observed level of collective contribution is deemed sufficient to sustain the public good and is generating a total benefit for the group that is at least as good as universal defection. This decision reinforces cooperative behavior.
        *   **If `C_prev < S_T`:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** The observed level of cooperation has fallen below the `Sustainability_Threshold`, indicating that the group is collectively underperforming relative to a baseline of zero contributions. This action serves as a collective punishment, aiming to incentivize other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds to restore mutually beneficial cooperation.

3.  **Round `r` (Final Round - End Game Effect):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finitely repeated game, there is no opportunity for future reciprocity or punishment. Individual rationality dictates defecting to maximize immediate personal gain, as there are no long-term consequences for the collective.

**Robustness and Collective Alignment:**

*   **Adaptive:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective contribution level of the previous round, using a threshold derived directly from the game's parameters.
*   **Robust:**
    *   It initiates cooperation, seeking the highest collective outcome.
    *   It tolerates some level of defection as long as the `S_T` is met, allowing for recovery from minor deviations.
    *   It quickly retaliates against sustained low cooperation, preventing long-term exploitation by free-riders.
    *   It accounts for the unique incentives of the game's final round.
*   **Collective Mindset:** The strategy prioritizes collective welfare by aiming for high cooperation and implementing enforcement mechanisms (`S_T`) that reflect the group's overall performance. Its defection decisions are designed to restore collective contribution rather than solely maximize individual gain in the short term (except for the final round, where the game structure dictates individual rationality).

description_COLLECTIVE_14 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)", is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game while remaining robust against exploitation and adapting to the behavior of other players. It operates by reciprocating observed cooperation levels and adjusting its stance as the game progresses, particularly in its final stages.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Internal Strategy Parameters:**
*   **`COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`**: `0.75` (This means at least 75% of *other* players must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to continue contributing. This value signifies a strong commitment to collective welfare, requiring substantial collective effort from the group.)
*   **`ENDGAME_BUFFER`**: `2` (This defines the number of rounds before the final round where the strategy adopts a more cautious approach. So, rounds `r - ENDGAME_BUFFER` through `r` are considered endgame rounds.)

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1: Initial Collective Overture**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This initial contribution signals a strong willingness to cooperate and aims to establish a high baseline of collective action from the outset, promoting a positive feedback loop for all players.

2.  **Rounds 2 to (r - ENDGAME_BUFFER - 1): Adaptive Reciprocity Phase**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of each of these rounds, this strategy will observe the actions of all *other* `(n-1)` players from the *immediately preceding* round (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculation:** Determine the `other_players_cooperation_rate`. This is the proportion of other players who contributed (C) in round `t-1`.
        `other_players_cooperation_rate = (Number of other players who contributed in round t-1) / (n - 1)`
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `other_players_cooperation_rate >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If the observed collective effort from others is sufficiently high, this strategy reciprocates by contributing. This rewards cooperative behavior and aims to sustain a high level of collective welfare.
        *   **Else (`other_players_cooperation_rate < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If the level of collective cooperation from others falls below the acceptable threshold, this strategy responds by defecting. This serves to protect its own endowment from exploitation and signals a need for greater collective effort from the group.

3.  **Rounds (r - ENDGAME_BUFFER) to (r - 1): Endgame Caution Phase**
    *   **Observation:** Similar to the Adaptive Reciprocity Phase, observe the `other_players_cooperation_rate` from the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `other_players_cooperation_rate >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** Even as the game nears its conclusion, if collective cooperation remains strong, this strategy continues to contribute. This attempts to prolong the highest possible group payoff for as long as viable.
        *   **Else (`other_players_cooperation_rate < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** In the closing rounds, the incentive for individual defection typically increases. If collective cooperation wavers, this strategy prioritizes self-protection more aggressively to avoid being exploited by players who might transition to defection early.

4.  **Round r: Final Round Defection**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** Based on the principle of backward induction in a finitely repeated game, in the absolute final round, there is no future incentive for any player to cooperate. Defecting is the individually rational and self-protective choice to maximize one's final payoff, as any contribution would almost certainly be exploited without recourse.

This strategy effectively balances an initial, optimistic push for collective good with dynamic adaptation to observed behavior, ensuring robustness across a variety of opponent strategies. It aims for collective success but incorporates strong self-protective mechanisms to prevent exploitation, particularly as the game concludes.

*   `Aspiration_Level` (float): Represents the target collective contribution rate (between 0.0 and 1.0) for the group. This is the minimum average cooperation rate we expect from all players (including ourselves) in the previous round to continue cooperating. Initialized to `1.0`.
*   `Punishment_Timer` (integer): Counts down rounds during which the strategy will defect as a response to insufficient cooperation. Initialized to `0`.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Start by signaling a clear intention to cooperate, attempting to initiate a positive cycle of contributions from all players.
    *   **State Update:** `Aspiration_Level` remains `1.0`. `Punishment_Timer` remains `0`.

2.  **Middle Rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t`, observe the actions of all `n` players (including ourselves) from the previous round (`t-1`).
        *   Calculate `Total_Contributions_Previous_Round` (sum of `c_j` for all `j` in `t-1`).
        *   Calculate `Observed_Cooperation_Rate = Total_Contributions_Previous_Round / n`.

    *   **Step 1: Check Punishment Status**
        *   If `Punishment_Timer > 0`:
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** Continue the pre-determined punishment phase to reinforce the message that low cooperation is unacceptable.
            *   **State Update:** Decrement `Punishment_Timer` by 1. The `Aspiration_Level` is *not* adjusted during a punishment phase, providing a stable target for the group to return to.

        *   Else (`Punishment_Timer == 0`, no active punishment):
            *   **Step 2: Assess Group Cooperation Against Aspiration**
                *   If `Observed_Cooperation_Rate >= Aspiration_Level - (1/n)`:
                    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                    *   **Rationale:** The group has met or come close to our collective aspiration level, justifying continued cooperation. The `-(1/n)` tolerance allows for one player (other than ourselves) to have defected without triggering an immediate negative response, showing a degree of forgiveness.
                    *   **State Update (Aspiration Adjustment - Upwards):**
                        *   If `Observed_Cooperation_Rate == 1.0` (perfect cooperation) AND `Aspiration_Level < 1.0`:
                            *   `Aspiration_Level = min(1.0, Aspiration_Level + 0.1)`. (Slightly increase the aspiration towards full cooperation, if it's not already there and perfect cooperation was achieved. This gently pushes the group towards higher collective welfare).
                        *   Otherwise, `Aspiration_Level` remains unchanged.

                *   Else (`Observed_Cooperation_Rate < Aspiration_Level - (1/n)`):
                    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                    *   **Rationale:** The group's cooperation rate has fallen significantly below the aspiration level. This requires a punitive response to signal disapproval and attempt to re-establish a higher norm.
                    *   **State Update (Punishment Trigger & Aspiration Adjustment - Downwards):**
                        *   Set `Punishment_Timer = 2` rounds. (A fixed, short punishment duration is used to signal effectively without causing prolonged, destructive defection cycles).
                        *   Set `Aspiration_Level = max(0.5, Observed_Cooperation_Rate)`. (Lower our expectation to what the group actually achieved, ensuring the `Aspiration_Level` remains realistic, but with a floor of `0.5` (50% cooperation) to maintain a meaningful collective goal. If `Observed_Cooperation_Rate` is already below `0.5`, we still target `0.5` to avoid an endless race to the bottom).

3.  **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence behavior. A rational opponent will defect to maximize their individual payoff regardless of history. To prevent exploitation in a tournament setting, this strategy will also defect, aligning with game-theoretic rationality for the end game.

---

**Collective Alignment Rationale:**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** Starts with a contribution to signal a willingness to build a cooperative environment.
*   **Adaptive Expectations:** The `Aspiration_Level` dynamically adjusts, attempting to find the highest sustainable level of cooperation for the group. It rewards good collective behavior by maintaining or slightly increasing expectations, and responds to poor collective behavior by lowering expectations to a realistic floor.
*   **Group-Oriented Reciprocity:** Decisions are based on the *overall* group cooperation rate, not individual player actions. This is crucial for a public goods game where individual contributions are aggregated.
*   **Punishment and Forgiveness:** The `Punishment_Timer` implements a clear, temporary punishment phase to deter free-riding, followed by a return to conditional cooperation. This allows for re-establishing cooperation without being overly harsh or perpetually stuck in defection.
*   **Robustness:** The strategy incorporates practical robustness measures like tolerating minor deviations and defecting in the last round, preventing complete exploitation while still aiming for collective well-being in the repeated game.

This strategy, named "Adaptive Forgiving Reciprocator," is designed to foster collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game while remaining robust and self-protective against exploitation. It actively seeks to encourage high overall contributions by adapting its behavior based on the observed collective cooperation levels in prior rounds, embodying a "collective mindset" through strategic generosity.

**Information Tracked Internally (History for round `t`'s decision):**
*   `my_last_action`: Stores whether this strategy contributed ('C') or defected ('D') in the *previous* round (`t-1`).
*   `num_cooperators_last_round`: Stores the total number of players who contributed in the *immediately preceding* round (`t-1`).
*   `num_cooperators_two_rounds_ago`: Stores the total number of players who contributed in the round *before the preceding one* (`t-2`).

**Decision Rules:**

**1. First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   *Rationale:* This strategy begins with an act of good faith, signaling a willingness to cooperate and encouraging an initial collective effort from all players. This sets a positive precedent.
    *   **Internal Update (after this round's decision):** Set `my_last_action = C`. (The `num_cooperators_last_round` and `num_cooperators_two_rounds_ago` variables will be updated after round 1 concludes, in preparation for round 2's decision).

**2. Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   **Observation:** After round `t-1` concludes, this strategy records the total number of players who contributed in that round. Let this be `current_observation_num_cooperators`.
    *   **History Update (before making a decision for round `t`):**
        *   `num_cooperators_two_rounds_ago = num_cooperators_last_round`.
        *   `num_cooperators_last_round = current_observation_num_cooperators`.

    *   **Decision Rule for Round `t`:**
        *   Calculate the **Collective Cooperation Rate (CCR):** `CCR = num_cooperators_last_round / n`.

        *   **Scenario A: Collective Viability Met**
            *   If `CCR >= k/n`:
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                    *   *Rationale:* The observed collective cooperation level is sufficient to generate a positive overall benefit for the group (since `k/n` represents the break-even point for the group's total investment). This strategy contributes to maintain and foster this positive collective outcome, aligning with the collective mindset.
                *   **Internal Update:** Set `my_last_action = C`.

        *   **Scenario B: Collective Viability Not Met**
            *   If `CCR < k/n`:
                *   **Sub-scenario B1: Attempt to Re-engage (Forgiveness Logic)**
                    *   This sub-scenario is only applicable from Round `t=3` onwards, as it requires comparing cooperation levels from two prior rounds.
                    *   If `t >= 3` AND `my_last_action` was 'D' (meaning this strategy defected in round `t-1`) AND `num_cooperators_last_round > num_cooperators_two_rounds_ago` (meaning the number of cooperators has *increased* from round `t-2` to `t-1`):
                        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                            *   *Rationale:* Even though the overall cooperation is currently below the viability threshold, an observed upward trend in collective cooperation (after this strategy's prior defection) is taken as a positive signal. This strategy generously attempts to re-ignite and pull the group towards cooperation, demonstrating a commitment to restoring collective welfare.
                        *   **Internal Update:** Set `my_last_action = C`.
                *   **Sub-scenario B2: Protect Against Exploitation / Signal Need for More Cooperation**
                    *   Else (i.e., if `t=2` OR `my_last_action` was 'C' and this strategy was exploited in the previous round OR `my_last_action` was 'D' but there's no observed sign of collective improvement):
                        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                            *   *Rationale:* The collective cooperation is too low. If `t=2`, there isn't enough history to apply the forgiveness logic. For `t >= 3`, either this strategy contributed and was exploited, or it defected but saw no collective improvement. Defecting protects against further personal losses and serves as a strong signal to other players that a higher level of cooperation is required for this strategy to contribute.
                        *   **Internal Update:** Set `my_last_action = D`.

**3. Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   *Rationale:* In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions for reciprocity or punishment to be effective. The individually rational strategy, following principles of backward induction, is to free-ride, as there are no long-term consequences for defection. This ensures the strategy protects its own interests when collective incentives no longer apply.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_17 = '''
Strategy Name: Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperator (ARC)

This strategy aims to foster and sustain high levels of cooperation within the group by initiating cooperation, adaptively responding to observed collective behavior, and strategically withdrawing contributions to deter free-riding, while anticipating the dynamics of the end game. It balances the collective good with self-preservation in a competitive tournament environment.

**Internal State Variables (Initialized before Round 1):**

*   `Group_Trust_Level (GTL)`: A float, initialized to `1.0`. This variable represents the strategy's current assessment of the overall cooperativeness of the group. Higher values indicate higher trust in the group's willingness to contribute.
*   `Learning_Rate_Gamma`: A float constant, set to `0.3`. This determines how quickly `GTL` adapts to new observations. A value of `0.3` means `GTL` incorporates 30% of the last round's observed cooperation.
*   `Defection_Sensitivity_Multiplier_Delta`: A float constant, set to `1.5`. This factor makes `GTL` decrease more sharply when defection is observed compared to how it increases when cooperation is observed. This provides a stronger deterrent against free-riding.

**Decision Rules for Round `R` (where `1 <= R <= r`):**

**1. Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy starts with an optimistic gesture to signal its willingness to cooperate and to establish a baseline for potential collective cooperation. This aligns with fostering collective welfare from the outset, giving the group a chance to establish a cooperative equilibrium.

**2. Last Round (R = r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** Based on the principle of backward induction, individual incentives to free-ride are strongest in the final round as there are no future rounds for players to influence each other's behavior. Contributing in the last round would be naive and easily exploited.

**3. Intermediate Rounds (1 < R < r):**

    **A. Update `Group_Trust_Level (GTL)`:**
        *   At the beginning of round `R`, the strategy first observes the `Total_Contributions_Last_Round` (the sum of `c_j` for all players `j` in round `R-1`).
        *   Calculate the `Observed_Cooperation_Rate = Total_Contributions_Last_Round / n`.
        *   **If `Observed_Cooperation_Rate >= GTL` (the group's cooperation level is meeting or exceeding the current trust level):**
            *   `GTL = (1 - Learning_Rate_Gamma) * GTL + Learning_Rate_Gamma * Observed_Cooperation_Rate`
        *   **Else (`Observed_Cooperation_Rate < GTL`, the group's cooperation level is below the current trust level):**
            *   `GTL = (1 - Learning_Rate_Gamma * Defection_Sensitivity_Multiplier_Delta) * GTL + Learning_Rate_Gamma * Defection_Sensitivity_Multiplier_Delta * Observed_Cooperation_Rate`
        *   **Cap `GTL`:** Ensure `GTL` always remains within the valid range `[0.0, 1.0]`.
            *   `GTL = max(0.0, min(1.0, GTL))`

    **B. Calculate `Contribution_Decision_Threshold` for Current Round:**
        *   This dynamic threshold determines the minimum `GTL` required for this strategy to contribute in the current round. It adapts based on the game's parameters (`k/n`) and the proximity to the end of the game (`R/r`).
        *   `Base_Threshold = 0.6` (A default expectation of group cooperation, representing a moderately high requirement for contributing).
        *   `K_N_Adjustment = (1 - k/n) * 0.2`
            *   **Rationale:** If the `k/n` ratio (individual benefit from others' contributions) is low, the individual temptation to defect is stronger. Therefore, we require a higher observed `GTL` to justify our own contribution (this adjustment increases the threshold). Conversely, if `k/n` is high, we are more forgiving.
        *   `End_Game_Adjustment = (R / r) * 0.3`
            *   **Rationale:** As the game progresses and `R` approaches `r`, the temptation for all players to defect increases. To remain robust, this strategy becomes more cautious, requiring a higher `GTL` to contribute (this adjustment increases the threshold).
        *   `Contribution_Decision_Threshold = Base_Threshold + K_N_Adjustment + End_Game_Adjustment`
        *   **Cap `Contribution_Decision_Threshold`:** Ensure it stays within reasonable and sensible bounds, preventing it from being either too lenient or too strict.
            *   `Contribution_Decision_Threshold = min(0.95, max(0.1, Contribution_Decision_Threshold))`

    **C. Make Contribution Decision for Current Round:**
        *   **If `GTL >= Contribution_Decision_Threshold`:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** The observed collective cooperation level (reflected in `GTL`) is sufficiently high to justify continued contribution. This action reinforces positive group behavior and promotes the collective good.
        *   **Else (`GTL < Contribution_Decision_Threshold`):** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** The group's cooperation level is below the required threshold, indicating significant free-riding or a lack of collective commitment. Defecting in this scenario serves as a punishment mechanism, protects individual tokens, and signals that sustained cooperation requires mutual effort from all participants.

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Starting with a contribution in Round 1 demonstrates a proactive willingness to contribute to the public good and encourage an initial cooperative state.
*   **Rewarding Cooperation:** By maintaining contribution when `GTL` is high, the strategy incentivizes and sustains collective effort, reinforcing beneficial group behavior.
*   **Punishing Defection:** Withdrawing contributions when `GTL` is low actively deters free-riding, which is crucial for the long-term viability and stability of the public good in repeated interactions.
*   **Adaptability:** The dynamic threshold and `GTL` calculation allow the strategy to adjust to varying levels of group cooperativeness and game parameters. It constantly seeks to establish and maintain the highest possible level of collective contribution that the specific group dynamics and game rules will permit.
*   **Robustness:** While aiming for collective good, ARC avoids being a naive "always cooperate" strategy. Its adaptive and retaliatory mechanisms make it robust and competitive in a tournament against self-interested agents, thus making it more likely to successfully foster and maintain cooperation over time.

description_COLLECTIVE_18 = '''
This strategy, named the **Adaptive Group Cooperator (AGC)**, is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation within the Public Goods Game. It operates on principles of conditional reciprocity at a group level, aiming to build and maintain a cooperative equilibrium while protecting itself from exploitation, especially in a tournament setting.

---

### Adaptive Group Cooperator (AGC) Strategy Description

This strategy aims to maximize collective welfare by proactively initiating cooperation and then adapting its behavior based on the observed collective contributions of the group. It is robust to varying opponent behaviors by rewarding cooperation and signaling against widespread defection.

---

#### 1. Decision Rules

The strategy's decision (Contribute or Defect) for each round `t` depends on the round number and the history of collective contributions.

*   **Round 1 (Initial Stance):**
    *   The strategy will always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This serves as an initial signal of intent to cooperate, attempting to establish a cooperative baseline for the game and encouraging others to follow suit. It's a commitment to the collective good from the outset.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round `t`, where 1 < `t` < `r`):**
    *   For all rounds after the first but before the final round, the strategy's decision is based on the total collective contributions observed in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   Let `TotalContributions_PreviousRound` be the sum of contributions from all `n` players in Round `t-1` (i.e., `sum_j c_j_t-1`).
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   If `TotalContributions_PreviousRound >= ceil(n / 2)`:
            The strategy will **Contribute (C)** in the current round.
            *Rationale:* This rewards and reinforces group cooperation. If a simple majority of players (including potentially myself) contributed, it indicates a sufficient level of collective engagement to continue participating in the public good.
        *   Otherwise (if `TotalContributions_PreviousRound < ceil(n / 2)`):
            The strategy will **Defect (D)** (keep its token) in the current round.
            *Rationale:* This acts as a collective punishment or a protective measure. If collective contributions fall below the majority threshold, it signals dissatisfaction with insufficient cooperation and attempts to incentivize a return to a more cooperative state, or to protect the strategy from being a consistently exploited cooperator.

*   **Final Round (Round `r`):**
    *   In the very last round of the game, the strategy will always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This is a game-theoretically informed decision to prevent exploitation due to the known end of the game, where future repercussions for defection no longer exist. While this might appear to deviate from pure "collective" behavior in isolation, it is a robust and protective measure in a finite repeated game tournament environment, ensuring the strategy's overall competitiveness. The collective spirit is primarily upheld by attempting to build and maintain cooperation throughout all preceding rounds.

---

#### 2. Handling Edge Cases

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by always contributing to signal cooperative intent.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by always defecting to prevent exploitation in the absence of future interactions.
*   **`ceil(n / 2)`:** This threshold correctly handles both even and odd numbers of players (`n`) by requiring at least half of the players (rounded up) to contribute for continued cooperation.

---

#### 3. Collective Alignment

The Adaptive Group Cooperator strategy embodies a collective mindset through the following principles:

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** By starting with a contribution, the strategy actively tries to establish a positive cooperative dynamic within the group from the outset.
*   **Rewarding Collective Effort:** It encourages and sustains collective welfare by continuing to contribute when a substantial portion of the group demonstrates a commitment to the public good.
*   **Strategic Sanctioning:** Defecting when collective cooperation falls below a key threshold serves as an incentive for the group to restore cooperation in subsequent rounds. This "group punishment" mechanism is designed to steer the group back towards a state of higher collective payoff over the long run, rather than simply exploiting others.
*   **Robustness for Collective Goal:** The defection in the final round, while individually rational for that specific moment, is a necessary robustness measure in a tournament setting. It protects the strategy's overall performance and does not negate the strategy's strong collective orientation and efforts to build cooperation throughout the majority of the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_19 = '''
The following strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Contributor" (ACC), is designed to foster and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game (PGG) by adapting to the observed behavior of the group while protecting against exploitation. It prioritizes the establishment of a cooperative equilibrium to maximize collective welfare over the duration of the game, acknowledging the tournament context.

---

**Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC) Strategy**

**Goal:** To establish and maintain a high level of collective contribution by encouraging cooperation and deterring persistent free-riding, thus maximizing the overall payoffs for the group across all rounds, while ensuring individual performance in a competitive tournament environment.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round 1): Initiate Cooperation**
    *   In the very first round of the game, always **Contribute (C)** 1 token.
    *   *Rationale:* This action signals a clear intention to cooperate and attempts to establish a cooperative baseline for the group, allowing for the potential of high collective payoffs from the outset.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1): Adaptive Conditional Cooperation**
    *   For any round `t` between the second round and the second-to-last round (`1 < t < r`), the decision to contribute or defect is based on the collective behavior observed in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   **Observation:** After round `t-1` concludes, observe the actions of all `n` players.
    *   **Calculate Cooperation Index (CI):** Determine the proportion of players who contributed in round `t-1`.
        `CI = (Number of players who Contributed in round t-1) / n`
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If CI is greater than or equal to 0.5 (i.e., at least half of the players contributed in the previous round):**
            *   **Contribute (C)** 1 token.
            *   *Rationale:* This reinforces cooperative behavior when a substantial portion of the group demonstrates a willingness to contribute. It fosters a positive feedback loop for cooperation.
        *   **If CI is less than 0.5 (i.e., fewer than half of the players contributed in the previous round):**
            *   **Defect (D)**, keeping the 1 token and contributing 0.
            *   *Rationale:* This serves as a collective punishment mechanism. If cooperation falls below a critical threshold, the strategy responds by withholding contributions, aiming to deter widespread free-riding and encourage a return to a more cooperative state.

3.  **Last Round (Round r): Prevent Exploitation**
    *   In the final round of the game, always **Defect (D)**, keeping the 1 token and contributing 0.
    *   *Rationale:* In a finitely repeated game with a known end, the dominant strategy in the last round is to defect, as there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. Defecting in the final round prevents exploitation by other players who are likely to follow the same logic (backward induction), thus safeguarding the individual payoff. This is a crucial robustness measure for tournament play.

---

**Key Features and Rationale for Robustness:**

*   **Adaptive:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective contribution levels, making it responsive to opponent strategies.
*   **Robust to Exploitation:** By introducing a defection threshold (CI < 0.5) and defecting in the last round, the strategy protects itself from being consistently exploited by free-riders or by rational agents employing backward induction.
*   **Collective Mindset:** The core mechanism is designed to initiate and sustain high levels of cooperation (which leads to the Pareto optimal outcome where everyone contributes and receives `k`), only resorting to defection as a corrective measure against insufficient collective effort.
*   **Simplicity:** The threshold of 0.5 for the Cooperation Index is straightforward, making the strategy interpretable and broadly applicable across varying numbers of players (`n`) and multiplier values (`k`) without complex parameter tuning.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_20 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocation (ACR)**, is designed to foster cooperation in the Public Goods Game by balancing individual robustness with the goal of maximizing collective welfare. It adapts its behavior based on the observed history of contributions and the fundamental game parameters (`n`, `r`, `k`).

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Reciprocation (ACR)

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier for public good (1 < k < n)

**Internal State (maintained by the player):**
*   `total_contributions_sum_history`: A running sum of the `sum_j c_j` for all players across all *completed* rounds.
*   `rounds_completed`: A counter for the number of rounds that have been played and observed.

---

**Decision Rules: My Action in `current_round_number`**

1.  **Round 1 (Initiation of Cooperation):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   *Reasoning:* This strategy begins with a cooperative stance to signal its willingness to contribute to the public good and to give all other players an opportunity to initiate a cooperative cycle. This is foundational to building collective welfare.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < `current_round_number` < `r`):**
    *   **Step 1: Update History (based on `current_round_number - 1`):**
        *   After observing all players' actions (`c_j`) and payoffs from the *previous* round (`current_round_number - 1`):
            *   Add the sum of contributions from the previous round (`sum_j c_j_prev`) to `total_contributions_sum_history`.
            *   Increment `rounds_completed` by 1.
    *   **Step 2: Calculate Historical Cooperation Rate (`H_C`):**
        *   `H_C = total_contributions_sum_history / (n * rounds_completed)`
        *   *Explanation:* This represents the average fraction of players who have contributed across all previously completed rounds. It gives a broad indicator of the collective's commitment to the public good over time.
    *   **Step 3: Determine Dynamic Cooperation Threshold (`T_dynamic`):**
        *   `T_dynamic = 0.5 + 0.5 * (1 - k/n)`
        *   *Explanation:* This threshold is adaptive.
            *   If `k/n` is high (closer to 1), meaning the collective benefit from contributing is very efficient, `T_dynamic` will be lower (closer to 0.5). This implies the strategy is more forgiving and requires a lower historical cooperation rate to continue contributing, thereby encouraging high-potential collective efforts.
            *   If `k/n` is low (closer to 0), meaning the collective benefit is less efficient (or barely better than individual defection), `T_dynamic` will be higher (closer to 1.0). This means the strategy requires a very strong historical commitment from the collective to justify continued contribution, protecting against exploitation in less favorable collective environments.
    *   **Step 4: Decision based on Threshold:**
        *   **If `H_C >= T_dynamic`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   *Reasoning:* The collective has demonstrated a sufficient and sustained level of cooperation, warranting continued participation in the public good for mutual benefit.
        *   **Else (`H_C < T_dynamic`):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Reasoning:* The collective cooperation rate is below the required threshold. Contributing under these conditions would likely lead to exploitation. Defecting serves to protect individual payoff and, from a collective perspective, acts as a signal that greater collective effort is needed to restore cooperation.

3.  **Last Round (`current_round_number == r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Reasoning:* In a known finite game, backward induction dictates that rational players will defect in the final round to maximize their individual payoff, as there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. While this deviates from a purely altruistic "collective mindset," it is a necessary self-protective measure to ensure robustness against exploitation by other rational agents in a tournament setting, especially since "shared norms or coordination" cannot be assumed.

---

**Collective Mindset Alignment & Robustness:**

*   **Initiation:** Starts cooperatively to promote the collective good.
*   **Adaptation:** The `T_dynamic` threshold makes the strategy highly adaptive to the underlying economic parameters of the public good, being more generous when cooperation is highly beneficial and more cautious when it's not.
*   **Historical Context:** Uses an average over *all* past rounds (`H_C`), making it robust to isolated incidents of defection and focusing on the overall trend of collective behavior rather than just the immediate past.
*   **Reciprocity:** It reciprocates perceived collective cooperation. When the group as a whole cooperates sufficiently, it contributes; when cooperation falters, it defects to avoid exploitation and to signal the need for others to increase their contributions.
*   **Exploitation Prevention:** The strategy actively prevents itself from being a consistent "sucker" while still attempting to foster cooperation. The last-round defection is a critical robustness feature in a competitive, non-coordinating tournament environment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_21 = '''
This strategy, named the **Adaptive Collective Reciprocator (ACR)**, aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It operates on the principle of conditional reciprocity, initiating cooperation and then adapting its behavior based on the observed collective commitment of other players, while also protecting itself from exploitation.

---

**Strategy Description: Adaptive Collective Reciprocator (ACR)**

This strategy manages its contribution decisions across three distinct phases of the repeated Public Goods Game:

1.  **Initial Exploration Phase (Round 1):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** In the very first round (`current_round == 1`), the strategy will always **Contribute (C)** its token to the public good.
    *   **Rationale:** This action serves as a proactive signal of willingness to cooperate and provides an opportunity for all other players to demonstrate their own cooperative intent. It aims to kickstart a potentially cooperative dynamic.

2.  **Adaptive Reciprocation Phase (Intermediate Rounds):**
    *   For all rounds after the first and before the endgame window (i.e., `1 < current_round <= r - ENDGAME_DEFECTION_WINDOW`), the strategy's decision is dynamically determined by the collective behavior of all *other players* in the immediately preceding round.
    *   **Observation & Calculation:**
        *   After each round `t-1`, the strategy observes the actions of every other player.
        *   It calculates the `proportion_other_cooperation_prev_round` by summing the contributions of all other `(n-1)` players in round `t-1` and dividing by `(n-1)`.
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   If `proportion_other_cooperation_prev_round >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
            *   The strategy will **Contribute (C)** its token in the current round `t`.
            *   **Rationale:** A sufficient level of collective effort was observed from the group in the previous round. The strategy reciprocates this commitment to reinforce and maintain the public good.
        *   Else (`proportion_other_cooperation_prev_round < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):
            *   The strategy will **Defect (D)** (keep its token) in the current round `t`.
            *   **Rationale:** The collective contribution from other players was too low, indicating either a lack of commitment or an attempt at free-riding by a significant portion of the group. Defecting in response serves to protect against exploitation and to signal that a higher level of group commitment is required for the strategy to continue contributing.

3.  **Endgame Defection Phase (Last Few Rounds):**
    *   **Decision Rule:** In the final `ENDGAME_DEFECTION_WINDOW` rounds of the game (i.e., `current_round > r - ENDGAME_DEFECTION_WINDOW`), the strategy will always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This addresses the "unraveling" effect commonly observed in repeated games as the end approaches. With no future interactions to incentivize cooperation, individual incentives to free-ride become overwhelmingly dominant. Switching to defection in these final rounds prevents exploitation by other strategies that anticipate this effect.

---

**Strategy Parameters:**

*   **`COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`**: This is set to **0.5**. This means the strategy requires at least 50% of the *other* players to have contributed in the previous round to continue its own contribution.
*   **`ENDGAME_DEFECTION_WINDOW`**: This is set to **3**. The strategy will defect in the last 3 rounds of the game, regardless of past behavior.

---

**Collective Alignment:**

This strategy is designed with a collective mindset, aiming for the overall benefit of the group, but with a practical understanding of a competitive tournament environment:

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** It initiates cooperation to signal its desire for a high-payoff collective outcome.
*   **Conditional Enforcement:** By establishing a clear threshold for group cooperation, it implicitly sets a norm. It rewards collective effort and punishes widespread defection, thereby trying to "teach" and enforce a minimum standard for the public good.
*   **Protection Against Exploitation:** It avoids being a "sucker" that contributes indefinitely while others free-ride, which is crucial for long-term survival in a tournament against diverse strategies. Its defection serves both as a self-protective measure and a signal to recalibrate collective behavior.
*   **Adaptive Robustness:** Its responsiveness to the actual observed behavior of the group makes it adaptive to various opponent strategies (e.g., purely selfish, overly cooperative, or adaptive themselves), promoting stable cooperation when possible and avoiding exploitation when necessary.

description_COLLECTIVE_22 = '''
Here is a collective strategy designed for the Public Goods Game, emphasizing adaptiveness and robustness.

## Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR) Strategy

This strategy aims to foster and maintain cooperation by reciprocating observed collective effort. It prioritizes the potential for group welfare while protecting against excessive exploitation.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `k`: Multiplier for public good (1 < k < n)
*   `r`: Total number of rounds

**Information Used:**
After each round, this strategy observes the actions (Contribute/Defect) of all players in all previous rounds.

---

### Decision Rules:

**1. First Round (Round 1):**
*   **Action:** Contribute (C)
*   **Rationale:** To initiate cooperation and signal a willingness to invest in the collective good. This exploratory move is crucial for any strategy aiming to build collective welfare.

**2. Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r`):**
*   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t` (where `t > 1`), observe the actions of all `n` players from the immediate previous round (`t-1`).
*   **Calculate:** Count the total number of players who chose to Contribute (C) in round `t-1`. Let this count be `N_cooperators_prev_round`.
*   **Cooperation Threshold (T):** The strategy uses a dynamic threshold based on the game's multiplier.
    *   Set `T = k`.
    *   *Rationale:* The multiplier `k` represents the total benefit the group receives for each individual contribution. Using `k` as the threshold implies that the strategy considers the collective effort sufficient when at least `k` players are contributing. This balances generosity (allowing cooperation to build) with firmness (requiring a meaningful level of collective investment).
*   **Decision:**
    *   **If `N_cooperators_prev_round >= T` (i.e., `N_cooperators_prev_round >= k`):**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
        *   *Rationale:* A sufficient number of players demonstrated collective action in the previous round. This strategy reciprocates that effort, signaling continued willingness to cooperate and reinforce the collective behavior.
    *   **If `N_cooperators_prev_round < T` (i.e., `N_cooperators_prev_round < k`):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D)
        *   *Rationale:* Insufficient collective action was observed. This acts as a decentralized "punishment" or withdrawal of cooperation, signaling that the strategy will not be exploited if others are not contributing their fair share. This discourages free-riding and attempts to re-incentivize higher contributions in subsequent rounds.

**3. Last Round (Round `r`):**
*   **Action:** Apply the same rules as for Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r`).
*   **Rationale:** While backward induction in finitely repeated games often suggests defection in the final round, a truly collective and adaptive strategy should maintain its principles of conditional cooperation throughout the entire game. This avoids unilaterally exploiting others in the final round and reinforces consistency in its adaptive and reciprocal approach, even if it means potentially sacrificing a small amount of individual payoff against purely self-interested strategies in that specific round. It maintains the integrity of the collective signal.

---

### Collective Alignment and Robustness:

*   **Collective Mindset:** The strategy initiates cooperation and provides a mechanism to sustain it by rewarding collective effort. It actively encourages a state where all players contribute, leading to the maximal collective payoff of `n*k`.
*   **Adaptive:** It dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of *all* players in the prior round, making it responsive to changing game dynamics.
*   **Robust:** It avoids being a "sucker" (e.g., Always Cooperate) by defecting when collective contributions fall below a meaningful threshold. This prevents persistent exploitation by purely self-interested players. It can recover cooperation if other players shift back to contributing.
*   **Tournament Play:** Against a diverse set of strategies, ACR will test for cooperation, punish defection, and reward renewed cooperation, making it a strong contender for establishing and maintaining beneficial equilibria when possible, and protecting itself when cooperation fails.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_23 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**, is designed to induce and sustain high levels of collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game, while remaining robust and adaptive to varying behaviors of other players in a tournament setting. It balances a desire for collective welfare with pragmatic responsiveness to individual incentives.

---

### **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR) Strategy**

**Goal:** To maximize the collective welfare of the group over the long run by fostering cooperation, while maintaining individual robustness against free-riding and ensuring adaptability to evolving game dynamics.

**Strategy Parameters:**

*   **Cooperation_Threshold (`t_c`):** This defines the minimum fraction of players that must have contributed in the previous round for the group to be considered sufficiently cooperative.
    *   **Value:** `t_c = (n-1) / n`
    *   *Rationale:* This sets a high bar for collective action, expecting almost full cooperation (allowing for at most one player's defection) before considering the group to be operating effectively. This incentivizes broad participation.

*   **Punishment_Duration (`P_D`):** This is the number of consecutive rounds this strategy will choose to Defect (D) as a responsive "punishment" or signal, after observing that group cooperation has fallen below the `Cooperation_Threshold`, before it attempts to re-initiate cooperation.
    *   **Value:** `P_D = 2` rounds
    *   *Rationale:* A duration of two rounds allows for a clear signal of disapproval for sustained low cooperation, but is short enough to prevent getting stuck in a long cycle of mutual defection, demonstrating a forgiving nature.

**Internal State:**

*   **`Consecutive_Defections_By_Self`**: An integer, initialized to 0. This counter tracks how many consecutive rounds *this player* has chosen to Defect (D) in response to previously observed low group cooperation.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initialization):**
    *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Reasoning:* Begin with an optimistic, cooperative stance to signal willingness to contribute to the collective good and to give the group an opportunity to establish a high-cooperation equilibrium from the outset.
    *   Reset `Consecutive_Defections_By_Self = 0`.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Phase):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of each round, observe the total number of contributions made by *all* players in the immediate previous round (`round-1`). Let this be `C_prev_round`.
    *   **Calculation:** Determine the previous round's cooperation rate: `P_prev_round = C_prev_round / n`.

    *   **Logic:**
        *   **Scenario A: High Group Cooperation**
            *   If `P_prev_round >= Cooperation_Threshold`:
                *   *Decision:* The group is performing well. Reward and reinforce this positive behavior.
                *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
                *   Reset `Consecutive_Defections_By_Self = 0` (indicating that the group is back to an acceptable cooperative state, or has maintained it).
        *   **Scenario B: Low Group Cooperation (Response Phase)**
            *   If `P_prev_round < Cooperation_Threshold`:
                *   *Decision:* Group cooperation has fallen below the acceptable standard. A response is required to signal disapproval and apply pressure.
                *   **Sub-scenario B1: Within Punishment Duration**
                    *   If `Consecutive_Defections_By_Self < Punishment_Duration`:
                        *   *Decision:* Continue or initiate a punitive defection to reinforce the signal against insufficient cooperation.
                        *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
                        *   Increment `Consecutive_Defections_By_Self` by 1.
                *   **Sub-scenario B2: Punishment Duration Complete**
                    *   If `Consecutive_Defections_By_Self == Punishment_Duration`:
                        *   *Decision:* The specified punishment duration has elapsed. It's time to test if cooperation can be re-established, offering a chance for forgiveness.
                        *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)** (This is a "testing the waters" or "forgiveness" move).
                        *   Reset `Consecutive_Defections_By_Self = 0`.

3.  **Round `r` (Final Round - Edge Case):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Reasoning:* In the absolute final round of a finitely repeated game, there are no future interactions or consequences for actions taken. Standard game-theoretic backward induction suggests that the individually rational choice is to defect, regardless of past play or opponent behavior. This ensures robustness in a competitive tournament environment by preventing exploitation in the terminal round.

---

**Collective Alignment and Robustness:**

*   **Collective Mindset:** ACR aims for the collectively optimal outcome by starting cooperatively and maintaining cooperation when the group performs well. It prioritizes the sustained health of the public good.
*   **Adaptive:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective contribution rate of the previous round, rather than sticking to a fixed pattern.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   It is not a 'sucker' strategy; it will retaliate against insufficient cooperation.
    *   The `Punishment_Duration` limits the extent of defection, allowing for recovery and preventing endless spirals of non-cooperation.
    *   The final round defection handles the game-theoretic terminal condition, preventing exploitation when no future interactions exist.
    *   Its deterministic nature based on clear thresholds makes it potentially predictable for other adaptive agents, which can help in stabilizing cooperative dynamics.

description_COLLECTIVE_24 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Group Reciprocity" (AGR), aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game while remaining robust against exploitation in a competitive tournament setting. It balances the pursuit of collective welfare with the need for individual viability.

---

### **Adaptive Group Reciprocity (AGR) Strategy Description**

The AGR strategy observes the collective behavior of all players in previous rounds and adapts its own contribution decision based on a defined threshold.

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)
*   `c_j_t`: Contribution of player `j` in round `t` (1 for Contribute, 0 for Defect)

---

**1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs. Defect**

The strategy's decision for the current round `t` depends on the round number and the history of contributions.

*   **Rule 1: First Round (t = 1)**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy initiates cooperation to signal its willingness to contribute to the public good and to probe the cooperativeness of other players. This sets an initial positive tone for the game.

*   **Rule 2: Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r)**
    *   **Calculation:** At the beginning of round `t`, calculate the **Average Group Contribution (AGC)** from the *immediately preceding round* (`t-1`):
        `AGC = (Sum of all players' contributions in round t-1) / n`
    *   **Decision Threshold:**
        *   If `AGC >= 0.5`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
            *   **Rationale:** If at least half of the players contributed in the previous round, the strategy interprets this as a sufficient level of collective cooperation. It continues to contribute to reinforce this positive dynamic and sustain the public good. This threshold provides a balance between forgiveness (tolerating some free-riding) and the need for group effort.
        *   Otherwise (`AGC < 0.5`):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D)
            *   **Rationale:** If fewer than half of the players contributed in the previous round, the strategy interprets this as a significant decline in collective effort or a high level of free-riding. It defects to protect its own endowment from exploitation and to signal disapproval, aiming to incentivize other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds.

*   **Rule 3: Last Round (t = r)**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D)
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to reward cooperation or punish defection. The individually rational strategy is to defect, as any contribution would be exploited by rational opponents. This action ensures robustness and avoids being a "sucker" in the endgame.

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by Rule 1 (Always Contribute).
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by Rule 3 (Always Defect).
*   **Intermediate Rounds:** Robustly handled by Rule 2's adaptive logic, responding to the observed collective cooperation level.

---

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment**

The AGR strategy embodies a collective mindset by:

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Starting with a contribution to encourage a positive-sum outcome for the group.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** Actively contributing when the group demonstrates a reasonable level of cooperation (AGC >= 0.5), thereby supporting the collective good.
*   **Deterrence of Widespread Free-Riding:** Defecting when collective contributions are too low, which serves as a mechanism to discourage systematic free-riding and prevent the complete collapse of the public good. This is a pragmatic approach to maintaining collective welfare in a competitive environment.
*   **Balancing Act:** While acknowledging the strategic necessity of defection in certain circumstances (e.g., last round, or prolonged low cooperation), its core logic is geared towards fostering and maintaining cooperation for the majority of the game. It aims to be a "good citizen" that also protects itself from being consistently exploited.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_25 = '''
The following strategy, named "Adaptive Reciprocal Contributor (ARC)", aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game by combining an initial cooperative stance with adaptive reciprocity based on the collective behavior of other players. It is designed to be robust against various opponent strategies and aligns with a collective mindset within the constraints of individual decision-making.

---

### **Adaptive Reciprocal Contributor (ARC) Strategy**

**Core Principle:**
The ARC strategy begins by signaling a willingness to contribute to the public good. In subsequent rounds, it continuously monitors the collective contribution of other players and adjusts its own action to reciprocate observed cooperation levels. It aims to maximize overall public good contributions by rewarding collective effort and withdrawing support when collective contributions are insufficient, while always accounting for the unique dynamics of the final round.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy starts with a full contribution to establish a cooperative baseline and to signal a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial collective action. This initial contribution serves as an invitation for others to cooperate.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round `t` from `2` to `r-1`):**
    *   **Observation:** In each intermediate round `t`, the strategy first observes the actions of all other players in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   It calculates `P_others_cooperated_prev`, which is the proportion of other players who contributed in round `t-1`.
        *   `P_others_cooperated_prev = (Sum of contributions by all players *except self* in round t-1) / (n - 1)`
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `P_others_cooperated_prev >= 0.5`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If 50% or more of the other players contributed in the previous round, it indicates a sufficient level of collective effort and willingness to support the public good. The strategy reciprocates this positive collective behavior by contributing, thereby encouraging continued cooperation.
        *   **Else (`P_others_cooperated_prev < 0.5`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If less than 50% of the other players contributed, it signals a collective lack of cooperation or potential exploitation. The strategy responds by defecting to protect its own endowment and to provide an incentive for others to increase their contributions in future rounds. This prevents the strategy from being a "sucker."

3.  **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to influence. The incentive for future reciprocity vanishes, making individual defection the dominant strategy, irrespective of past play. This action is taken to optimize the individual payoff in the concluding stage, as is standard in game theory.

**Collective Alignment:**
The ARC strategy is fundamentally aligned with the collective mindset by actively attempting to foster and maintain a high level of cooperation. It achieves this by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Starting with a contribution to kickstart the public good.
*   **Reciprocating Collective Effort:** Responding positively to a critical mass of other players contributing, thereby reinforcing cooperative norms.
*   **Protecting Against Exploitation:** Strategically withdrawing contributions when collective effort is low, which serves as a signal to non-cooperators and prevents the public good from collapsing due to unreciprocated contributions.
*   **Promoting Sustainable Cooperation:** By adapting to the collective, the strategy aims to establish a stable equilibrium where overall contributions are maximized for as long as possible within the game's duration.

This strategy balances the desire for collective welfare with the necessity for individual robustness in a competitive tournament setting.

description_COLLECTIVE_26 = '''
The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity," is designed to foster and maintain collective cooperation while being robust against exploitation in a repeated Public Goods Game tournament. It relies solely on observable game history and parameters, aiming to maximize overall contributions when possible, but defending against sustained defection.

---

### Adaptive Collective Reciprocity Strategy

This strategy is based on conditional cooperation, aiming to contribute when the collective shows sufficient willingness to do so, and to defect otherwise to prevent exploitation and signal the need for more widespread cooperation. It accounts for the unique dynamics of the first and last rounds of a finitely repeated game.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Decision Rules:**

**1. First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** Cooperate (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Begin by signaling a willingness to contribute and establish a cooperative baseline. This acts as an initial overture for collective benefit, allowing other players to observe this cooperative intent.

**2. Middle Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   **Action:** Observe the collective behavior from the *immediately preceding round*.
    *   Let `N_coop_prev` be the total number of players who contributed (C) in the previous round.
    *   **If `N_coop_prev >= ceil(n / 2)`:**
        *   **Action:** Cooperate (C).
        *   **Rationale:** If a majority (or at least half) of players demonstrated cooperation in the last round, it signals a viable collective effort. This strategy reciprocates that cooperation, striving to maintain or increase the collective contribution level.
    *   **Else (if `N_coop_prev < ceil(n / 2)`):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale:** If fewer than `ceil(n / 2)` players contributed, it indicates insufficient collective effort. Defecting serves two purposes:
            1.  It protects against exploitation when a significant portion of the group is free-riding.
            2.  It acts as a signal or "punishment" that the current level of cooperation is unacceptable and may encourage others to contribute more in subsequent rounds to re-establish a higher cooperative equilibrium.

**3. Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. The "shadow of the future" vanishes, making it individually rational for all players to defect, regardless of past behavior. Cooperating in this round would only lead to exploitation without any potential for future collective gain.

---

**Summary of Strategy Logic:**

This strategy can be summarized as: "Start cooperative, maintain cooperation if a strong enough collective effort (majority) is observed, punish insufficient cooperation to protect oneself and encourage future cooperation, and always defect in the final round." It balances the collective goal of high contributions with the need for individual robustness in a competitive tournament setting.

description_COLLECTIVE_27 = '''
This strategy, named the "Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC)," aims to foster and maintain cooperation in the Public Goods Game by reciprocating observed collective effort, while also preventing exploitation. It operates on the principle that individual contribution is warranted when the group demonstrates a sufficient commitment to the public good.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC)**

**Objective:** To achieve and sustain collective welfare by promoting conditional cooperation. This strategy is adaptive to observed behavior, robust against various opponent types, and aligned with the collective good.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Play):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This establishes an initial intent to cooperate and provides an opportunity to initiate a cooperative equilibrium. It signals a willingness to invest in the collective good.

2.  **Rounds 2 to r-1 (Adaptive Play):**
    *   **Information Used:** Observe the `total_contributions_prev` (sum of all players' contributions) from the immediately preceding round.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `total_contributions_prev >= k`:**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** The collective has met or exceeded the threshold `k` (the multiplier for contributions). This indicates that the group is collectively investing enough to make the public good beneficial. By contributing, this strategy rewards and reinforces observed collective effort, aiming to sustain a high level of cooperation.
        *   **Else (if `total_contributions_prev < k`):**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (contribute 0 tokens).
            *   **Rationale:** The collective participation fell below the `k` threshold. This signals insufficient collective investment. Defecting prevents exploitation by free-riders and communicates that a higher level of cooperation is required for this strategy to continue contributing.

3.  **Round r (Final Round):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)** (contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** In a finite repeated game, the final round eliminates any incentive for future reciprocity. Contributing in the last round would be an individually suboptimal choice, as there are no subsequent interactions to reward cooperation or punish defection. Defecting maximizes immediate payoff in this specific scenario.

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy fundamentally aligns with the collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Starting with a contribution to build a foundation for collective good.
*   **Conditional Contribution:** Basing subsequent contributions on the *collective* performance of the group, not just individual actions. The threshold `k` is crucial: it represents the game's intrinsic multiplier for contributions. By contributing only when `total_contributions_prev >= k`, the strategy ensures it is participating when the public good mechanism is performing effectively for the group as a whole.
*   **Deterring Free-Riding:** By defecting when collective contributions are too low, the strategy discourages widespread defection and incentivizes a return to cooperation, thereby protecting the collective investment.

**Robustness Considerations:**

*   **Adaptive to Behavior:** The strategy continuously adjusts based on the entire group's previous actions, making it resilient to diverse opponent behaviors (e.g., always defectors, always cooperators, other conditional cooperators).
*   **Clear Threshold:** The use of `k` as a threshold provides a clear, game-parameter-driven condition for cooperation, which is easy for other adaptive strategies to potentially infer and align with.
*   **Balance of Trust and Self-Preservation:** It balances an initial trust and desire for collective good with a mechanism to protect against exploitation, making it robust in a tournament setting against unknown strategies.

**Strategy: Adaptive Group Reciprocity (AGR)**

**Overview:**
The AGR strategy initiates cooperation to signal a willingness for collective action. In subsequent rounds, it acts as a conditional cooperator, rewarding sufficient group-level contributions with continued cooperation and signaling disapproval of widespread free-riding by defecting. This approach balances the pursuit of the collective good with self-protection against exploitation.

---

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initiation of Cooperation):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** To proactively signal a willingness to participate in the collective effort and to establish a baseline for potential collective benefit. Cooperation cannot begin without an initial contribution.

*   **Rounds 2 to r (Adaptive Cooperation Phase):**
    *   At the start of each round `t` (where `t > 1`), observe the **total number of contributions made by all `n` players** (including self) in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`). Let this count be `C_prev`.
    *   **Cooperation Condition:** If `C_prev` is greater than or equal to `ceil(n / 2)` (i.e., a simple majority of players contributed in the previous round), then **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
        *   **Rationale:** This decision rule rewards and encourages collective effort. If a majority of the group is demonstrating cooperation, it indicates a sufficient level of reciprocal engagement to warrant continued individual contribution towards the common good. This threshold allows for a minority of defectors without immediately breaking the cooperative equilibrium, promoting resilience.
    *   **Defection Condition:** Otherwise (if `C_prev` is less than `ceil(n / 2)`), then **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
        *   **Rationale:** This decision rule serves as a deterrent against widespread free-riding and protects the player from sustained exploitation. If less than a majority of the group is contributing, it suggests that collective effort is faltering or that too many players are attempting to free-ride. Defecting in this scenario signals that cooperation requires sufficient group participation and prevents one from being a perpetual "sucker" in a largely uncooperative environment.

---

**2. Handle Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (Round 1):** Explicitly covered by Rule 1, always starting with a contribution.
*   **Last Round (Round r):** The same adaptive rule (Rule 2) applies to the final round as to all intermediate rounds. This strategy does not implement a special end-game defection based on backward induction. Instead, it maintains its adaptive nature throughout the game, allowing for the possibility of sustained cooperation until the very end if the observed group behavior (specifically, a majority of contributions in the penultimate round) supports it. This aligns with the collective mindset by not prematurely abandoning cooperation when it might still be collectively beneficial.

---

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Proactive Contribution:** AGR explicitly starts with cooperation, setting a precedent for collective action.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** Its decisions are based on the *group's collective behavior* rather than just individual interactions. It demands a critical mass (`ceil(n/2)`) of cooperators to continue contributing, thereby seeking mutual support.
*   **Dynamic Self-Correction:** By switching to defection when collective contributions are low, AGR aims to penalize collective non-cooperation. This mechanism encourages the group to return to a more cooperative state, preventing long-term exploitation of willing cooperators and promoting a more stable collective optimum.
*   **Aims for Collective Payoff:** While individual defection offers a higher immediate payoff in any single round, AGR is designed to create conditions where sustained high-level cooperation (which yields the collectively optimal payoff `k` for all players) is achievable, contingent on sufficient group participation. It prioritizes the possibility of a high collective outcome over guaranteed minimal individual gains.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity**

This strategy is designed to promote and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game by initiating with trust, responding conditionally to the collective behavior of the group, and protecting itself from exploitation. It leverages observable history and game parameters to adapt its decisions, aiming to foster a high level of overall cooperation without assuming shared norms or explicit coordination from other players.

---

**1. Decision Rules**

*   **Round 1 (Initiating Trust):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   *Rationale:* The strategy begins by contributing its token. This signals a willingness to cooperate and provides all players an initial opportunity to contribute to the collective good, setting a positive foundation for subsequent rounds.

*   **Rounds 2 through (r-1) (Conditional Reciprocity):**
    *   For each of these intermediate rounds, the strategy evaluates the collective actions from the *immediately preceding round*.
    *   Let `N_cooperators_last_round` be the total number of players who contributed (C) in the previous round.
    *   **Decision Threshold:**
        *   If `N_cooperators_last_round >= k` (where `k` is the game's multiplier parameter):
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   *Rationale:* If a sufficient number of players (at least `k`) demonstrated cooperation in the previous round, it indicates that the collective is actively contributing to the public good at a meaningful level. This strategy rewards such collective effort by continuing its own contribution, thereby encouraging the maintenance of cooperation.
        *   Else (if `N_cooperators_last_round < k`):
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**
            *   *Rationale:* If the observed level of cooperation falls below the critical threshold `k`, it signals that the collective effort is insufficient. Continuing to contribute in such circumstances would make this strategy vulnerable to free-riding. By defecting, the strategy protects itself from exploitation and sends a clear signal to non-cooperators that a higher level of collective contribution is required to sustain its own cooperation.

*   **Round r (Endgame Rationality):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round of a finite game, there are no future rounds in which to reward or punish past actions. Standard game theory predicts that purely rational players will defect to maximize their immediate payoff without consequence. To avoid being exploited by other rational agents in the tournament, this strategy will defect in the last round.

**2. Handling Edge Cases**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by the "Initiating Trust" rule (always Contribute).
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by the "Endgame Rationality" rule (always Defect).
*   **Zero Cooperators in a Previous Round:** If `N_cooperators_last_round` is 0, then `0 < k` (since `k > 1` is a game parameter), which correctly triggers a Defect action, punishing universal defection.
*   **Full Cooperation in a Previous Round:** If `N_cooperators_last_round` is `n`, then `n >= k` (since `n > k` is a game parameter), which correctly triggers a Contribute action, rewarding universal cooperation.

**3. Collective Alignment**

This strategy is inherently collective in its aim. It strives to establish and maintain high levels of public good provision for the mutual benefit of all players. By:
*   **Starting cooperatively:** It provides an initial impetus for collective action.
*   **Conditioning cooperation on group behavior:** It aligns individual incentives with collective outcomes. It's designed to be responsive to the overall group's commitment to the public good, rather than being an unconditional cooperator (sucker) or an unconditional defector (exploiter).
*   **Utilizing the `k` parameter as a threshold:** This choice reflects a pragmatic approach to collective viability. If fewer than `k` players contribute, the collective benefit generated is limited, and a strategic defection serves to either encourage future cooperation or protect against further losses. If `k` or more players contribute, the collective outcome is deemed sufficiently robust to warrant continued participation.
*   **Protecting against exploitation:** While aiming for collective good, the strategy is also robust against purely self-interested players by defecting when cooperation levels are too low, thereby preventing situations where it consistently loses out while others free-ride.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_30 = '''
This strategy, named "Collective Reciprocator," aims to foster and sustain high levels of cooperation within the group, adapting to observed collective behavior while remaining resilient to free-riding and promoting overall group welfare. It uses a blend of optimism, conditional cooperation, and measured forgiveness.

**Strategy Name:** Collective Reciprocator

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n).
*   **`ForgivenessWindow_M`**: Number of past rounds to consider when evaluating the group's cooperation level.
    *   *Default:* `M = 3` (This makes the strategy moderately forgiving and robust to single-round fluctuations). If `r < M`, use `r-1` for intermediate rounds.
*   **`CooperationThreshold_T`**: The minimum average group cooperation rate (0 to 1) required to continue contributing.
    *   *Default:* `T = 0.6` (This encourages a strong majority of players to contribute for continued cooperation).
*   **`ToleranceFactor_F`**: A small allowance below the `CooperationThreshold_T` before triggering defection.
    *   *Default:* `F = 0.1` (This means the strategy will still cooperate if the average group rate is slightly below `T`, making it more forgiving).

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This initial action signals a clear intention to cooperate and contribute to the collective good. It acts as an optimistic "open hand" to establish a foundation for collective play and to gather initial information on opponent tendencies.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   **Information Gathering:** Before making a decision, calculate the `AverageGroupCooperationRate` over the most recent `min(ForgivenessWindow_M, current_round - 1)` past rounds.
        *   `AverageGroupCooperationRate = (Sum of all players' contributions across these past rounds) / (n * number_of_past_rounds_considered)`
        *   (e.g., if `ForgivenessWindow_M=3` and it's Round 3, consider Rounds 1 and 2. If it's Round 4, consider Rounds 1, 2, and 3.)

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   If `AverageGroupCooperationRate >= (CooperationThreshold_T - ToleranceFactor_F)`:
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Reasoning:* The group's collective behavior indicates an acceptable or good level of cooperation. The strategy rewards this by continuing its own contribution, aiming to sustain collective welfare. The `ToleranceFactor_F` allows for minor deviations without immediate punishment.
        *   Else (`AverageGroupCooperationRate < (CooperationThreshold_T - ToleranceFactor_F)`):
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   *Reasoning:* The group's cooperation has fallen below the acceptable threshold. This strategy temporarily defects to signal dissatisfaction and to deter persistent free-riding. This "punishment" aims to prompt a return to higher cooperation levels in subsequent rounds for the collective benefit.

3.  **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Reasoning:* In the final round, there are no future interactions or consequences for defection. Backward induction dictates that individual rationality prevails, and defection is the dominant strategy to maximize one's own payoff in this single-stage endgame.

---

**Collective Alignment Summary:**
This strategy is designed with a strong collective mindset:
*   **Initiates Cooperation:** Always starts with a contribution to encourage group cooperation.
*   **Aims for High Cooperation:** Sets a relatively high `CooperationThreshold_T` to push the group towards maximum collective benefit.
*   **Forgiving but Firm:** Uses a `ForgivenessWindow_M` and `ToleranceFactor_F` to allow for minor lapses and avoid destructive cycles of mutual defection, while still punishing sustained free-riding.
*   **Group-Oriented Response:** Reacts to the *average* behavior of the entire group rather than singling out individual players, promoting a unified response to overall group dynamics.
*   **Adaptive:** Continuously adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective history, promoting robustness against various opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_31 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity," aims to foster and maintain high levels of cooperation among players by responding to the collective behavior observed in previous rounds. It is designed to be robust against defection while being willing to cooperate when others do, aligning with the goal of maximizing collective welfare in the repeated Public Goods Game.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity**

This strategy maintains an internal `cooperation_mode` which can be either `COOPERATIVE` or `PUNISHMENT`. It initializes in `COOPERATIVE` mode.

---

**1. Decision Rules (When to Cooperate vs Defect):**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This establishes an initial willingness to cooperate and contribute to the collective good. It serves as a necessary first step to signal potential for a cooperative equilibrium.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   After each round `t-1`, observe the actions of all players. Calculate `N_C_prev`, the total number of players who contributed `1` token in round `t-1`.

    *   **If `cooperation_mode` is `COOPERATIVE`:**
        *   **Check:** If `N_C_prev >= floor(n * 0.75)` (i.e., 75% or more of players contributed).
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** A high level of collective cooperation is being maintained. Continue to contribute to sustain this beneficial state for the group.
        *   **Else (`N_C_prev < floor(n * 0.75)`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Transition:** Switch `cooperation_mode` to `PUNISHMENT`.
            *   **Rationale:** The level of cooperation has fallen below an acceptable threshold. Defect to avoid exploitation by free-riders and to signal that a higher collective contribution is expected.

    *   **If `cooperation_mode` is `PUNISHMENT`:**
        *   **Check:** If `N_C_prev >= floor(n * 0.90)` (i.e., 90% or more of players contributed). This requires a strong collective effort to signal a return to cooperation.
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Transition:** Switch `cooperation_mode` back to `COOPERATIVE`.
            *   **Rationale:** A very high level of cooperation has been restored, indicating a strong collective willingness to return to a cooperative equilibrium. Respond in kind to foster sustained cooperation and exit the punishment phase.
        *   **Else (`N_C_prev < floor(n * 0.90)`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** The collective level of cooperation is not yet high enough to warrant ending the punishment. Continue to defect to avoid exploitation and to reinforce the signal for increased collective contribution.

*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** Due to the finite nature of the game and the absence of future interactions, there is no incentive to contribute in the final round. Defecting is the individually rational action, as there's no consequence for free-riding.

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (Round 1):** Handled by initiating with a contribution (C) to set a cooperative tone.
*   **Last Round (Round r):** Handled by defecting (D) due to the end-game effect and lack of future consequences.
*   **Small `n` (number of players):** The `floor(n * percentage)` thresholds ensure appropriate behavior even with small `n`. For example, if `n=2`, `floor(2 * 0.75) = 1` and `floor(2 * 0.90) = 1`. This means if at least one other player cooperates, the condition is met (which, for `n=2`, implies the opponent cooperated). This effectively becomes a Tit-for-Tat variant for two players.

---

**3. Collective Alignment:**

*   **Initial Trust:** Starts by contributing, signaling a preference for collective benefit.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Actively promotes cooperation by contributing when others largely do. This encourages a positive feedback loop for high collective payoffs.
*   **Enforcement of Norms:** Punishes collective defection (by switching to `PUNISHMENT` mode and defecting) to prevent free-riding from collapsing the public good.
*   **Forgiveness:** Allows for a return to cooperation once a very high threshold of collective cooperation is re-established, providing an escape route from a persistent defection cycle and encouraging recovery to the socially optimal outcome.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** The thresholds are based on the *proportion* of cooperators, making the strategy robust to varying group sizes (`n`) and reflecting a collective assessment of the game's state.

This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, capable of establishing and maintaining cooperation with other similarly rational and adaptive agents, while protecting itself against exploitation by consistently defecting players.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_32 = '''
This strategy is designed for collective welfare maximization within the Public Goods Game, balancing the desire for universal cooperation with the need for robustness against free-riding. It aims to foster cooperation by initially trusting and then adapting behavior based on the observed collective contribution of other players, ensuring that collective effort is reciprocated.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity**

This strategy relies on observing the collective behavior of other players and adapting its contribution decision based on a defined threshold of cooperation. It aims to encourage high levels of group contribution while protecting against widespread exploitation.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Trust and Probe):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy begins with an act of cooperation to signal a willingness to contribute to the public good. This also serves as an initial probe to gauge the general cooperativeness of the other players in the game.

*   **Rounds 2 to (r-1) (Adaptive Reciprocity):**
    *   At the beginning of each round `t` (from 2 up to, but not including, the final round `r`), the player will evaluate the actions of all other `(n-1)` participants in the *immediately preceding round* (`t-1`).
    *   Calculate `Num_Cooperated_Others_Prev`: This is the exact count of how many *other* players contributed (chose C) in round `t-1`.

    *   **Decision Rule based on `Num_Cooperated_Others_Prev`:**
        *   **If `Num_Cooperated_Others_Prev` is greater than or equal to `ceil((n-1)/2)`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** This threshold signifies that a significant portion—at least half, and for odd `n-1` specifically a strict majority—of the other players actively cooperated in the previous round. In such a scenario of robust collective effort, this strategy reciprocates by contributing, thereby reinforcing and sustaining the cooperative equilibrium for the benefit of the group. It is forgiving of a minority of non-cooperators but demands a substantial collective contribution.
        *   **Else (if `Num_Cooperated_Others_Prev` is less than `ceil((n-1)/2)`):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If fewer than the defined threshold of other players contributed, it indicates a significant decline in collective effort or widespread free-riding. In response, this strategy defects. This action serves as a conditional punishment to avoid exploitation and to signal to the group that higher collective participation is required to resume individual contributions. It aims to coerce a return to higher cooperation rates.

*   **Round r (Final Round Defection):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions or rounds to influence. Under these conditions, the dominant individual strategy is to defect (keep the private endowment), as there is no further opportunity for reciprocation or punishment. Adopting this ensures individual robustness in the endgame.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
*   **First Round (Round 1):** Handled by the "Initial Trust and Probe" rule: always Cooperate.
*   **Last Round (Round r):** Handled by the "Final Round Defection" rule: always Defect.
*   **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):** Handled by the "Adaptive Reciprocity" rule, which dynamically adjusts based on observed collective behavior in the previous round.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**
This strategy is fundamentally collective in its aim:
*   **Encourages Collective Welfare:** If widely adopted by players, it leads to universal cooperation (until the last round), which is the collectively optimal outcome in the Public Goods Game (as `k > 1`).
*   **Conditional Forgiveness:** It doesn't punish a single defection but rather requires a significant dip in collective contributions before retaliating, allowing for minor deviations or noise without collapsing cooperation.
*   **Promotes Stability:** By linking individual contribution to collective contribution, it creates an incentive structure that rewards broad cooperation and punishes widespread free-riding, aiming to stabilize high contribution rates.
*   **Adaptive to Group Dynamics:** The use of `ceil((n-1)/2)` as a threshold means the strategy adapts to the number of players, requiring a robust level of group participation (at least half of the other players) to maintain individual cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_33 = '''
The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)", is designed to promote and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game, while being robust against exploitation in a tournament setting. It is adaptive, responds to observed behavior, and acknowledges the strategic implications of a finite game horizon.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)

**Core Philosophy:** ACR's primary goal is to foster and maintain the highest possible level of collective contribution to maximize total group welfare. It initiates cooperation to build trust, reciprocates observed cooperation to sustain it, and employs a clear deterrent mechanism against persistent collective defection to protect itself from being a "sucker." It is also strategically aware of the 'endgame' effect in finite repeated games.

**Internal State Variables (initialized at the start of the game):**
*   `permanent_defection_mode_active`: A boolean, initialized to `false`. This flag indicates if the strategy has decided to permanently defect due to prolonged very low cooperation.
*   `low_cooperation_streak`: An integer, initialized to `0`. This counter tracks consecutive rounds where collective cooperation fell below a critical threshold.

**Parameters (derived from game rules and set at the start):**
*   `n`: Number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for the public good.
*   `InitialCooperationRounds`: Set to `2`. This specifies the number of opening rounds where the strategy will always contribute to establish a cooperative tone (unless `r` is too small to allow it).
*   `CooperationThreshold`: Calculated as `max(0.5, k/n + 0.1)`. This threshold determines the minimum average contribution rate from the previous round required to justify continued cooperation. It requires at least 50% cooperation, but demands more if the `k/n` ratio (individual return on contribution) is already high, setting a higher bar for collective effort.
*   `CriticalLowCooperationRate`: Set to `0.2`. This is a very low average contribution rate that signals severe collective defection.
*   `DefectionStreakThreshold`: Set to `2`. This is the number of consecutive rounds the `CriticalLowCooperationRate` must be met or exceeded before the strategy switches to `permanent_defection_mode_active`.

---

**Decision Rule for Current Round `t`:**

The strategy evaluates the following conditions in sequential order. The first rule that is met dictates the action.

1.  **Permanent Defection Mode Check:**
    *   If `permanent_defection_mode_active` is `true`:
        *   **Action: Defect (D).** (This rule overrides all others once triggered, ensuring protection against prolonged exploitation).

2.  **Final Round Check:**
    *   If `t == r` (the current round is the very last round of the game):
        *   **Action: Defect (D).** (In the final round of a finite game, backward induction dictates individual defection as the rational choice, as there are no future rounds to influence behavior).

3.  **Initial Cooperation Phase Check:**
    *   If `t <= InitialCooperationRounds` (e.g., rounds 1 or 2):
        *   **Action: Contribute (C).** (This aims to establish initial trust and signal a willingness to cooperate, giving other players an opportunity to reciprocate).

4.  **Adaptive Reciprocity Phase (for all other intermediate rounds `t`):**

    *   **Observe Past Round's Collective Cooperation:**
        *   Retrieve `past_round_total_contributions`, which is the sum of `c_j` for all players in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
        *   Calculate `cooperation_rate_prev_round = past_round_total_contributions / n`.

    *   **Evaluate for Critical Exploitation (Deterrence Logic):**
        *   If `cooperation_rate_prev_round < CriticalLowCooperationRate`:
            *   Increment `low_cooperation_streak` by 1.
        *   Else (if cooperation was not critically low):
            *   Reset `low_cooperation_streak` to `0`.

        *   If `low_cooperation_streak >= DefectionStreakThreshold`:
            *   Set `permanent_defection_mode_active = true`. (This flag will take effect from the *next* round, ensuring subsequent rounds immediately fall under Rule 1).

    *   **Conditional Cooperation Logic:**
        *   If `cooperation_rate_prev_round >= CooperationThreshold`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).** (This rewards observed sufficient cooperation and encourages its continuation).
        *   Else (if `cooperation_rate_prev_round < CooperationThreshold`):
            *   **Action: Defect (D).** (This responds to insufficient cooperation, signaling disapproval and reducing immediate losses).

---

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**
ACR directly aligns with a collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Starting with contributions to foster group trust and kickstart collective welfare.
*   **Rewarding Cooperation:** Continuing to contribute when the group shows sufficient cooperation, reinforcing positive behavior.
*   **Protecting Collective Value:** While it defects in response to low cooperation, this is not purely selfish. It's a mechanism to prevent exploitation and to encourage a return to a cooperative equilibrium, which ultimately benefits the collective more than being an endless "sucker."
*   **Deterring Free-Riding:** The `permanent_defection_mode_active` acts as a credible threat against extreme and sustained free-riding, aiming to shift the group towards a higher average contribution over time, or at least minimize losses in a truly uncooperative environment.
*   **Strategic End-Game Awareness:** Defecting in the final round is a game-theoretically sound move that prevents individual exploitation when there's no future for reciprocity, indirectly benefiting the player in a tournament where others might also be employing rational end-game strategies.

This strategy, named **Dynamic Collective Reciprocity (DCR)**, aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by adaptively responding to the group's observed behavior, while protecting individual interests in the face of widespread defection. It is designed to be robust against various opponent strategies in a tournament setting.

---

### Dynamic Collective Reciprocity (DCR) Strategy

**Game Parameters:** `n` (number of players), `r` (number of rounds), `k` (multiplier, where `1 < k < n`).

**Internal State:**
*   `cooperation_sentiment`: A floating-point value representing the group's perceived willingness to cooperate. It ranges from 0.0 (full defection) to 1.0 (full cooperation).

---

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Opening Phase):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This initiates cooperation, signals a willingness to contribute to the collective good, and provides an opportunity for others to observe the benefits of cooperation.
    *   **Internal State Update:** Initialize `cooperation_sentiment = 1.0`. This assumes a hopeful starting point of full cooperation for subsequent adaptive calculations.

*   **Rounds 2 to r-1 (Adaptive Phase):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round *t*, observe the actions of all players from the *previous round (t-1)*.
    *   **Calculate `current_round_cooperation_rate`:** This is the proportion of total possible contributions that were actually made in round `t-1`.
        `current_round_cooperation_rate = (Sum of all players' contributions in round t-1) / n`
    *   **Update `cooperation_sentiment`:** The `cooperation_sentiment` is updated using a weighted average, giving more emphasis to recent group behavior while retaining some memory of past performance.
        `cooperation_sentiment = (0.8 * current_round_cooperation_rate) + (0.2 * cooperation_sentiment)`
    *   **Set `required_cooperation_threshold`:** This threshold is derived from the game parameter `k/n`, which represents the individual share of any single contribution to the collective good.
        `required_cooperation_threshold = k / n`
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `cooperation_sentiment >= required_cooperation_threshold`:
            *   **Decision:** **Contribute (C).**
            *   **Rationale:** The collective's historical cooperation level is sufficiently high to warrant continued contribution. This reinforces positive collective behavior.
        *   Else (`cooperation_sentiment < required_cooperation_threshold`):
            *   **Decision:** **Defect (D).**
            *   **Rationale:** The collective's cooperation level has fallen below the critical threshold required for sustained individual contribution. Defecting protects individual payoff and signals dissatisfaction, potentially prompting others to increase their contributions.

*   **Round r (Last Round - Edge Case):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a repeated game, there are no future consequences for current actions. Defecting maximizes individual payoff without affecting future rounds or the opportunity for punishment or reward. This is a game-theoretically robust choice in the absence of shared norms or coordination, and it protects against opponents who will also defect in the final round.

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
*   **First Round (Round 1):** Addressed by explicitly stating an initial contribution to signal cooperative intent.
*   **Last Round (Round r):** Addressed by explicitly stating a defection, aligning with robust game-theoretic principles for the terminal round.
*   **Sustained Defection:** If the group consistently defects (`current_round_cooperation_rate` remains low), the `cooperation_sentiment` will drop and stay below `k/n`. The strategy will then consistently defect, protecting its endowment.
*   **Re-engagement/Forgiveness:** If the group starts to cooperate again after a period of defection (even if one player starts contributing), `current_round_cooperation_rate` will increase. This increase will pull `cooperation_sentiment` up, and if it rises above `k/n`, the strategy will resume cooperation, allowing for re-establishment of collective action.

**3. Collective Alignment:**
The DCR strategy aims to find an equilibrium where cooperation is sustained.
*   It starts with cooperation to initiate collective benefits.
*   It requires the collective to maintain a certain level of cooperation (`k/n`) to continue contributing, thereby incentivizing participants to contribute rather than free-ride.
*   The `k/n` threshold means the strategy demands that, on average, the group contributes enough such that if the total contribution `k * sum_j c_j / n` were hypothetically distributed, each individual would receive at least `k/n` per token contributed by others (excluding their own immediate loss). This encourages a baseline of collective reciprocity.
*   Its adaptive nature allows it to respond to the group's "mood," encouraging cooperation when possible and protecting itself when others exploit the system.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive High-Cooperation Enforcement (AHCE)

This strategy aims to establish and maintain maximum collective cooperation while being resilient to free-riding and adaptive to changing group behaviors. It operates under the principle that the group should strive for full contribution, but it offers a degree of forgiveness for temporary lapses.

**Game Parameters Used:**
*   `n` (total number of players)
*   `r` (total number of rounds)

**Internal State (history-dependent):**
*   `rounds_without_full_cooperation`: An integer counter, initialized to 0. This counter tracks the number of *consecutive* rounds where the entire group did not contribute (i.e., total contributions were less than 'n'). It resets to 0 whenever a round of full cooperation (all 'n' players contributing) is observed.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Always Contribute (C).**
        This establishes an initial intent for collective cooperation and gives all players the opportunity to begin the game contributing to the public good.
    *   Initialize `rounds_without_full_cooperation` to 0.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Intermediate Rounds):**
    *   At the start of each of these rounds, the strategy observes the total contributions from the *previous* round (`t-1`). Let `C_prev` be `sum_j c_j_{t-1}`.

    *   **Update Internal State:**
        *   If `C_prev == n` (meaning all players contributed in the previous round):
            *   Reset `rounds_without_full_cooperation` to 0. The group has successfully achieved full cooperation.
        *   Else (`C_prev < n`, meaning at least one player did not contribute in the previous round):
            *   Increment `rounds_without_full_cooperation` by 1. The group did not achieve full cooperation.

    *   **Make Decision:**
        *   **IF `rounds_without_full_cooperation <= 1`:**
            *   **Contribute (C).**
                This represents a period of tolerance. The strategy is willing to overlook one round of less-than-full cooperation (whether by one or multiple players), giving the group a chance to self-correct and return to full cooperation. This prevents an immediate "grim trigger" collapse from a single or initial defection.
        *   **ELSE (`rounds_without_full_cooperation > 1`, meaning two or more consecutive rounds have occurred without full cooperation):**
            *   **Defect (D).**
                This is a punitive response to persistent free-riding or a sustained failure of the group to achieve full cooperation. By defecting, the strategy signals that continuous exploitation or a prolonged lack of collective effort is not acceptable.

3.  **Round `r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Always Defect (D).**
        In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. The individually rational action is to free-ride, maximizing one's own payoff without consequences in subsequent rounds.

**Collective Alignment:**
*   **Promotes Collective Optimum:** The strategy starts with and consistently strives for full collective contribution (`C_prev == n`) to achieve the highest possible group payoff.
*   **Adaptive Forgiveness:** It incorporates a degree of forgiveness by tolerating single instances of defection or collective failure, allowing the group to self-correct and re-establish cooperation. This makes the strategy robust to minor, non-persistent deviations.
*   **Guards Against Exploitation:** It reacts defensively by defecting if the lack of full cooperation persists for more than one round, preventing indefinite free-riding by others. This ensures the strategy is not a "sucker" in the long run.
*   **Group-Centric Decisions:** All decisions are based on the aggregate behavior of the entire group (`C_prev`), rather than singling out individual players. This aligns with a collective mindset where the overall health and contribution to the public good are paramount.

description_COLLECTIVE_36 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**, aims to foster and sustain cooperation within the group while protecting against exploitation. It is designed to be adaptive to the observed behavior of other players and robust across various game conditions and opponent strategies.

**Strategy Description: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**

**Core Principle:**
The ACR strategy begins by demonstrating a willingness to cooperate. In subsequent rounds, it adapts its behavior based on the observed level of cooperation from other players in the preceding round. It aims to maintain cooperation if a majority of others are contributing to the public good, but will defect to protect its own payoff if collective contributions fall below a critical threshold. The strategy recognizes the unique incentives of the final round.

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: The multiplier for collective contributions (1 < k < n).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Probe for Cooperation):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** In the very first round, the player initiates cooperation. This serves as a signal of willingness to contribute to the collective good and establishes a baseline for observing the initial responses of other players.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   **Information Gathering:** Observe the actions of all other `n-1` players in the *immediately preceding round*.
    *   Calculate `num_other_cooperators`: This is the count of players (excluding self) who contributed 1 token (Action C) in the last round.
    *   Calculate `cooperation_rate_others`: This is `num_other_cooperators` divided by `(n - 1)`.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `cooperation_rate_others >= 0.5` (Majority Cooperation):**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If a majority (or more) of the other players contributed in the previous round, it indicates a generally cooperative environment. The strategy responds by continuing to contribute, supporting the collective welfare and signaling a sustained commitment to cooperation.
        *   **Else (`cooperation_rate_others < 0.5` - Insufficient Cooperation):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If less than a majority of other players contributed, it suggests a breakdown in collective action or a high risk of exploitation. The strategy defects to protect its own endowment and avoid being a "sucker," while also potentially signaling a need for others to increase their cooperation to re-establish a cooperative equilibrium.

3.  **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to influence. The incentive structure reverts to that of a one-shot game, where individual rationality dictates defection to maximize immediate payoff, as there is no opportunity for future reward or punishment. This rule prevents exploitation by strategies that will inevitably defect in the final round.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_37 = '''
This strategy, named the "Adaptive Majority Cooperator" (AMC), aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by reciprocating good behavior while punishing widespread defection. It balances the pursuit of collective welfare with the need for individual robustness in a competitive tournament setting.

**Strategy: Adaptive Majority Cooperator (AMC)**

The AMC strategy monitors the level of contribution from the group in the previous round and adjusts its action accordingly, with specific rules for the very first and very last rounds of the game.

---

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Exploration):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy begins with an act of cooperation to signal a willingness to pursue the collective optimum. This is an initial investment in establishing a cooperative environment and allows other players to observe a benevolent starting point.

*   **Rounds 2 to r-1 (Adaptive Play Phase):**
    *   **Information Used:** Observe the total number of contributions `S_{t-1}` (where `S_{t-1} = sum_j c_j`) from all players in the immediately preceding round `t-1`.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `S_{t-1} >= n / 2`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If half or more of the players contributed in the previous round, the group is demonstrating a sufficient level of cooperation. The strategy rewards this by continuing its contribution, reinforcing the cooperative equilibrium. (Note: For odd `n`, this condition means `S_{t-1}` must be `ceil(n/2)` or greater, effectively requiring a strict majority).
        *   **Else (`S_{t-1} < n / 2`):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If less than half of the players contributed, it indicates a significant decline in collective cooperation or an unacceptable level of free-riding. The strategy responds by defecting, acting as a punishment to deter further exploitation and signaling that cooperation requires a collective effort. This can potentially reset expectations or encourage defectors to reconsider their actions in subsequent rounds.

*   **Round r (Final Round - Endgame):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to reward cooperation or punish defection. Standard game theory dictates that the individually rational choice is to defect, as there is no strategic benefit to contributing. Cooperating in this round would only lead to exploitation by any rational opponent. This decision accounts for the "backward induction" effect that often unravels cooperation at the end of finite repeated games.

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by always contributing to initiate cooperation.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by always defecting due to the lack of future reciprocity.
*   **Small `n` (Number of Players):** The `n/2` threshold dynamically adjusts. For instance, if `n=2`, `S_{t-1} >= 1` means at least one player (which could be the other player or both) contributed. If `n=3`, `S_{t-1} >= 1.5` means at least 2 players contributed. This ensures the threshold scales appropriately with the group size.

---

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

The Adaptive Majority Cooperator strategy embodies a collective mindset by:

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Starting with a contribution to signal a willingness to collaborate for the collective good.
*   **Reciprocating Cooperation:** Continuously contributing as long as the group maintains a robust level of contribution, aiming to sustain high collective payoffs.
*   **Punishing Collective Defection:** Defecting when collective contributions fall below a critical threshold, not out of pure selfishness, but to deter widespread free-riding and encourage a return towards a more cooperative state. This mechanism is designed to protect the collective from exploitation and guide the group back to beneficial interactions.
*   **Balancing Robustness and Welfare:** It seeks to achieve the highest possible aggregate group payoff by fostering cooperation, but it is also pragmatic and robust enough to avoid being a "sucker" against overly aggressive or purely selfish strategies, ensuring its own long-term survival and ability to influence collective outcomes.

description_COLLECTIVE_38 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Forgiver," is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game while remaining robust against exploitation. It balances the pursuit of the collective optimum with individual protection, adapting its behavior based on the observed actions of all players in previous rounds.

**Strategy: Adaptive Forgiver**

**Key Principles:**
*   **Initiate Trust:** Always start by cooperating to signal a willingness for collective gain.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Base subsequent actions on the overall level of cooperation observed in the group.
*   **Forgiveness:** Tolerate minor deviations from full cooperation to prevent an immediate collapse of trust, especially in larger groups.
*   **Punishment:** React to significant or widespread defection by defecting, protecting individual payoffs and signaling that collective exploitation is unsustainable.
*   **Endgame Rationality:** Defect in the final round when future consequences are absent.

---

**Decision Rules:**

**1. First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is an unconditional show of good faith, aiming to initiate a cooperative equilibrium and achieve the higher collective payoff (k per player).

**2. Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`):**
    *   **Information:** Observe the actions of all players in the immediately preceding round (round `t-1`).
    *   **Calculation:** Determine `N_D_prev`, the total number of players who **Defected (D)** in the previous round `t-1`. (Note: This includes your own action if you defected).

    *   **Conditional Actions:**
        *   **A. If `n = 2` (Two-Player Game):**
            *   If `N_D_prev = 0` (meaning both players contributed in `t-1`):
                *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
                *   **Rationale:** Full cooperation is sustained; reinforce it.
            *   If `N_D_prev > 0` (meaning the other player defected in `t-1`):
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
                *   **Rationale:** In a two-player game, a single defector means the *only other player* defected. Tolerating this leads to exploitation. This is a strict Tit-for-Tat response for `n=2`.

        *   **B. If `n > 2` (Multi-Player Game):**
            *   If `N_D_prev <= 1` (meaning zero or one player defected in `t-1`):
                *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
                *   **Rationale:** This is a generous response. It tolerates a single defection, viewing it as a potential anomaly, test, or minor lapse. The aim is to forgive and provide an opportunity to re-establish full cooperation for the collective good.
            *   If `N_D_prev > 1` (meaning two or more players defected in `t-1`):
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
                *   **Rationale:** When multiple players defect, it signals a significant breakdown of collective action or widespread free-riding. Defecting protects individual payoff and signals that such behavior is costly to the group and will be met with resistance.

**3. Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** Based on backward induction, there are no future rounds in which to be rewarded or punished. The individually rational choice is to defect, regardless of past play, as it maximizes personal payoff in the final round.

---

**Summary of Collective Alignment:**
This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Starting with 'Contribute' sets a positive tone for collective welfare.
*   **Forgiving Minor Lapses:** Tolerating a single defector (in `n>2` games) prioritizes the long-term collective benefit over immediate retribution, allowing for re-establishment of cooperation.
*   **Punishing Widespread Defection:** When collective effort significantly falters, defecting aims to deter future free-riding by demonstrating that exploitation will not go unchecked, thereby attempting to steer the group back towards cooperation.
*   **Adapting to Group Size:** The threshold for tolerance is adjusted for `n=2` to prevent immediate exploitation, making the strategy more robust across different game configurations.

### **Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC) Strategy**

This strategy operates in distinct phases, adapting its decision based on the round number, game parameters, and observed history of contributions.

#### **1. Decision Rules**

**Phase 1: Initial Signal (Round 1)**

*   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
*   **Rationale:** The strategy begins by signaling its willingness to cooperate and foster a positive environment for collective welfare. This sets a precedent and allows the strategy to gather initial data on other players' propensities to contribute.

**Phase 2: Adaptive Reciprocity (Rounds 2 to `r-1`)**

*   **Information Used:** The total number of contributors in the immediately preceding round (`C_prev`).
*   **Decision Logic:**
    1.  Calculate the **proportion of cooperators** in the previous round: `p_c = C_prev / n`.
    2.  Compare `p_c` against a dynamic **cooperation threshold**, which is set by the game parameter `k/n`.
        *   **If `p_c >= k/n`:** The strategy **Contributes (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If the observed level of cooperation in the group meets or exceeds the inherent efficiency of the public good (i.e., the individual return rate `k/n`), the strategy continues to contribute. This reinforces collective action and rewards past cooperation, aiming to sustain a high-payoff equilibrium for all players. The choice of `k/n` as a threshold means:
                *   If the public good is highly efficient (high `k/n`), the strategy expects a high level of cooperation from others and will quickly defect if this standard isn't met.
                *   If the public good is less efficient (low `k/n`), the strategy is more forgiving, contributing even with a lower collective contribution, to try and build cooperation where it's harder to establish.
        *   **Else (`p_c < k/n`):** The strategy **Defects (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If the observed level of cooperation falls below the critical threshold, it signals that the collective is not adequately supporting the public good or that too many players are free-riding. In this scenario, the strategy defects to protect itself from exploitation and to signal disapproval, aiming to incentivize other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds.

**Phase 3: Final Round Realization (Round `r`)**

*   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
*   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to influence. Backward induction dictates that individual self-interest will lead to defection, regardless of past play. To avoid being exploited by other strategies acting rationally, this strategy prioritizes its own payoff in the final round.

#### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

*   **First Round (`t=1`):** Explicitly handled by Phase 1, always contributing to initiate cooperation.
*   **Last Round (`t=r`):** Explicitly handled by Phase 3, always defecting to prevent exploitation.
*   **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t < r`):** Handled by Phase 2, adapting behavior based on the previous round's collective contribution and the game's inherent efficiency.

#### **3. Collective Alignment**

The Adaptive Collective Contributor strategy is designed with a collective mindset by:

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** It starts by contributing to provide a foundation for collective benefit.
*   **Sustaining Cooperation:** It uses a dynamic threshold (`k/n`) directly linked to the public good's efficiency, striving to maintain cooperation when it's collectively beneficial and responsive to the collective effort. This mechanism encourages a "tit-for-tat"-like reciprocity at the group level.
*   **Protecting Against Exploitation:** While seeking collective good, the strategy is not blindly altruistic. It prevents persistent free-riding by defecting when collective contributions fall too low, ensuring its own long-term viability in a competitive tournament and thereby promoting robust collective dynamics.
*   **Strategic Pragmatism:** Its final-round defection acknowledges the realities of finite games, balancing the ideal of collective action with the strategic imperative to avoid predictable exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_40 = '''
Here is a collective strategy designed for the Public Goods Game, emphasizing adaptive behavior and robustness in a tournament setting:

---

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Majority Reciprocity (AMR)**

This strategy aims to foster collective cooperation by contributing when the group shows sufficient willingness to do so, while protecting itself from exploitation by non-contributors. It adapts its behavior based on the observed contributions of all players in previous rounds.

**1. First Round (Round 1):**
*   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
*   **Rationale:** The strategy begins by making a cooperative gesture. This serves as an initial signal of willingness to contribute to the collective good and tests the propensity of other players to cooperate. It sets an optimistic tone for potential collective welfare.

**2. Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`):**
*   **Observation:** At the end of each preceding round (round `t-1`), the strategy observes the actions of all `n` players.
*   **Calculation:** It calculates `num_cooperators_prev`, which is the total count of players (including self, if applicable) who contributed 1 token in the previous round.
*   **Decision Rule:**
    *   If `num_cooperators_prev` is greater than or equal to `n/2` (i.e., at least half of the players contributed in the previous round), then **Contribute (C)**.
    *   Else (if `num_cooperators_prev` is less than `n/2`), then **Defect (D)**.
*   **Rationale:** This rule establishes a clear, adaptive threshold for sustained collective action. If a significant portion of the group (at least half) is contributing, the strategy continues to contribute, reinforcing the collective effort. This promotes high overall payoffs when the group is willing to cooperate. However, if the level of cooperation drops below this critical mass, the strategy switches to Defect. This protects against being a "sucker" to free-riders and signals that continued cooperation requires a broader commitment from the group.

**3. Last Round (Round `r`):**
*   **Decision:** Defect (D).
*   **Rationale:** In the final round of the game, there are no future interactions for which to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. According to backward induction, the individually rational choice in this specific scenario is to defect, regardless of prior game history. This ensures the strategy does not incur the cost of contribution without any potential future reciprocal benefits.

**Summary of Collective Mindset, Adaptability, and Robustness:**
*   **Collective Mindset:** The strategy prioritizes the establishment and maintenance of collective cooperation by initiating contributions and sustaining them when a majority reciprocates. Its goal is to achieve the highest possible group payoff by encouraging widespread contribution.
*   **Adaptive:** It dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the most recent collective actions of the group, rather than adhering to a fixed pattern.
*   **Robust:**
    *   It cooperates with other cooperative strategies, leading to mutually beneficial outcomes.
    *   It quickly identifies and responds to purely exploitative (Always Defect) strategies by ceasing cooperation after the first round, thus limiting its losses.
    *   The `n/2` threshold provides a balanced approach: it's not overly strict (like a grim trigger that punishes any single defection) nor overly permissive, allowing it to navigate a mix of opponent behaviors effectively.
    *   It handles the specific edge cases of the first and last rounds appropriately based on game theory principles.

## Collective Strategy: Adaptive Majority Reciprocity (AMR)

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (where `1 < k < n`)

**Strategy Logic (for player `i`):**

The strategy relies on a dynamic assessment of the group's past cooperation, with specific rules for the initial and final rounds.

1.  **Initialize (Round 1):**
    *   In the very first round (`t=1`), player `i` will always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This signals a strong intent to cooperate and attempts to establish a positive cooperative baseline for the game.

2.  **Determine Cooperation Threshold (`T`):**
    *   The threshold `T` represents the minimum total number of contributions observed in the *previous* round that will induce player `i` to contribute in the *current* round.
    *   Set `T = ceil(n / 2)`.
    *   *Rationale:* This threshold mandates that a strict majority of the group must be contributing for cooperation to be maintained. It's a robust and commonly understood level for collective action, balancing the need to foster cooperation with the need to avoid being exploited by too many free-riders.

3.  **Decision Rule (Rounds 2 to `r-1`):**
    *   For any round `t` between the second and the penultimate round:
        1.  Observe the total number of contributions from **all `n` players** in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`). Let this be `TotalContributions_t-1`.
        2.  **If `TotalContributions_t-1 >= T`:** Player `i` will **Contribute (C)** in round `t`.
            *   *Rationale:* If a majority of the group is contributing, the strategy continues to cooperate, reinforcing the collective effort.
        3.  **If `TotalContributions_t-1 < T`:** Player `i` will **Defect (D)** in round `t`.
            *   *Rationale:* If cooperation falls below the majority threshold, the strategy punishes the group's low contribution by defecting. This serves as a disincentive for free-riding and signals that collective action is required to maintain cooperation. This strategy is "forgiving" as it will immediately revert to cooperation if `TotalContributions` rises above `T` in a subsequent round.

4.  **Final Round Decision (Round `r`):**
    *   In the very last round (`t=r`):
        1.  Observe the total number of contributions from **all `n` players** in the penultimate round (`r-1`). Let this be `TotalContributions_r-1`.
        2.  **If `TotalContributions_r-1 == n`:** Player `i` will **Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* This is a rare and powerful signal. If every single player (including player `i`) fully cooperated in the penultimate round, player `i` will reciprocate this perfect collective effort in the final round, foregoing the individually rational defection to reward sustained, full cooperation.
        3.  **If `TotalContributions_r-1 < n`:** Player `i` will **Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* In all other scenarios where perfect cooperation was not achieved in the penultimate round, player `i` will defect. This is a robust defense against exploitation in the final round, where backward induction commonly leads to widespread defection. It protects player `i` from losses when others are likely to free-ride.

---

**Summary of Collective Mindset & Robustness:**

*   **Collective Mindset:** The strategy prioritizes initiating cooperation (Round 1), setting a clear bar for collective effort (`T = ceil(n/2)`), and actively working to maintain it by rewarding contributions and punishing free-riding. It even sacrifices individual rationality in the final round under conditions of perfect collective behavior to uphold the cooperative ideal.
*   **Adaptiveness:** Decisions are based entirely on the most recent round's outcome, making the strategy highly responsive to changes in opponent behavior. It can recover from periods of low cooperation if the group's behavior improves.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Against consistent defectors:** If other players consistently defect, `TotalContributions` will quickly fall below `T`, leading player `i` to defect from Round 2 onwards, preventing continuous exploitation.
    *   **Against consistent cooperators:** If other players consistently cooperate, `TotalContributions` will meet or exceed `T`, leading player `i` to cooperate, resulting in the collectively optimal outcome.
    *   **Against mixed or learning strategies:** The strategy's conditional nature allows it to establish cooperation with adaptive opponents, punish occasional free-riders, and re-establish cooperation when the group's contribution level recovers.
    *   **End-game:** The specific last-round rule balances the collective ideal with individual self-preservation, ensuring robustness in a competitive tournament environment.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC)

**Overview:**
The Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC) strategy is designed to foster and sustain high levels of cooperation in the Public Goods Game, aiming for the collectively optimal outcome where all players contribute. It operates on principles of conditional reciprocity, balancing a proactive cooperative stance with a robust defense against exploitation. ACC adapts its behavior based on the observed actions of other players, striving to build and maintain a cooperative equilibrium while acknowledging the competitive nature of a tournament against diverse, independent AI systems.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This initial contribution serves as a clear signal of the strategy's willingness to cooperate. It's a proactive step to seed a cooperative environment and allows for the observation of other players' initial responses, which will inform subsequent decisions.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   **Information Used:** In each intermediate round, the strategy observes the actions of all `n-1` other players from the *immediately preceding round* (t-1).
    *   **Calculation:** Calculate the "Average Other Contribution Rate" for the previous round:
        `AverageOtherContributionRate = (Sum of contributions from all other players in round t-1) / (n-1)`
        *(Note: 'n-1' is the total number of other players, excluding self.)*
    *   **Action:**
        *   **If `AverageOtherContributionRate >= 0.5`:**
            Contribute (C).
            *Rationale:* If at least half of the other players demonstrated a willingness to contribute in the previous round, this strategy reciprocates their cooperation. This aims to reinforce and sustain the collective effort, moving towards or maintaining the high-cooperation equilibrium where all players benefit.
        *   **If `AverageOtherContributionRate < 0.5`:**
            Defect (D).
            *Rationale:* If less than half of the other players contributed, it indicates that collective cooperation is faltering or insufficient. In this scenario, the strategy defects. This serves as a defensive measure to prevent exploitation by non-cooperative players and acts as a signal that the current level of collective contribution is too low to warrant individual sacrifice. The goal is to encourage others to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds if they desire the collective benefits.

3.  **Final Round (t = r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of any repeated game, the incentive structure reverts to that of a single-shot game because there are no future interactions to influence. For individual players, defecting becomes the dominant strategy to maximize immediate payoff, regardless of others' actions. In a tournament against independent AI systems, assuming shared "collective norms" in the final round would be strategically naive and could lead to exploitation. This pragmatic choice ensures robustness and prevents self-sacrifice in an end-game scenario where the mechanisms for sustaining cooperation (reciprocity over time) no longer apply.

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**
The Adaptive Collective Contributor strategy is fundamentally aligned with fostering collective welfare. It proactively attempts to initiate and maintain cooperation, recognizing that mutual contribution leads to the highest possible payoff (`k` for each player, where `k > 1`) for the group. Its conditional cooperation mechanism is designed to reward and encourage collective action while strategically discouraging free-riding. The decision to defect in the final round, while seemingly individualistic, is a necessary robustness measure born from the understanding that an uncoordinated tournament environment may contain agents not sharing this collective ideal in the absence of future consequences. This strategy aims to achieve the *most sustainable and robust* collective outcomes possible under real-world tournament conditions, rather than adhering to an idealistic but exploitable form of cooperation.

This strategy is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game, while being adaptive and robust against various opponent behaviors. It prioritizes maximizing collective welfare through conditional cooperation, recognizing the need for self-protection against free-riding and exploitation.

---

### **Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocator (ACR)**

**1. Collective Mindset & Goal:**

The Adaptive Collective Reciprocator aims to achieve the highest possible collective payoff for the group by promoting widespread contribution to the public good. It operates on a principle of conditional reciprocity: it is willing to contribute as long as a significant portion of the group demonstrates a commitment to cooperation. However, it will strategically defect to protect itself from exploitation if collective cooperation falters, thereby incentivizing a return to higher contribution levels.

**2. Decision Rules:**

The strategy's action in each round `t` depends on the current round number (`t`), the total number of rounds (`r`), and the history of actions from the previous round (`t-1`). Let `n` be the number of players and `k` be the multiplier, with `1 < k < n`.

*   **Round 1 (Initial Play):**
    *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy starts with an act of trust and a clear signal of its willingness to contribute to the public good. This initial cooperation provides an opportunity for other players to observe and reciprocate, thereby establishing a foundation for a cooperative equilibrium.

*   **Rounds 2 to (r-1) (Adaptive Play):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t`, observe the actions of all `n` players from the immediately preceding round (`t-1`). Calculate `N_C_prev`, which is the total number of players who contributed (action `C`) in round `t-1`.
    *   **Action:**
        *   **If `N_C_prev >= k`:** **Contribute (C)**
            *   **Rationale:** If the number of contributors in the previous round was greater than or equal to the multiplier `k`, it indicates a sufficient level of collective commitment. This threshold signifies that the group is generating substantial collective benefit, making continued individual contribution strategically worthwhile for sustaining overall group welfare.
        *   **Else (`N_C_prev < k`):** **Defect (D)**
            *   **Rationale:** If the number of contributors falls below the multiplier `k`, it signals a significant decline in collective action or an increase in free-riding. In such a scenario, continued individual contribution would lead to exploitation. This strategy responds by defecting to protect its own payoff and to signal to other players that sustained low contributions will be met with non-cooperation, encouraging them to restore higher levels of contribution.

*   **Round r (Final Round - Endgame):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no subsequent interactions to incentivize future cooperation or punish defection. The "shadow of the future" disappears. Therefore, the individually rational strategy is to defect to maximize personal payoff in this last round, as any contribution would likely be exploited without the possibility of future reciprocity.

**3. Robustness & Adaptiveness Summary:**

The Adaptive Collective Reciprocator is designed to be robust by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Giving the group a chance to cooperate from the start.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** Rewarding collective cooperation by continuing to contribute, fostering a positive feedback loop.
*   **Self-Protection & Punishment:** Defecting when collective cooperation drops too low, preventing exploitation and providing an incentive for others to return to cooperation.
*   **Parameter-Driven Threshold:** Utilizing the game parameter `k` as a dynamic and relevant threshold for evaluating collective commitment.
*   **Endgame Awareness:** Avoiding the "sucker's payoff" in the final round by switching to defection.

This strategy balances the desire for collective benefit with the necessity of self-preservation in a competitive tournament environment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_44 = '''
This strategy, named "Evolving Collective Reciprocity (ECR)", is designed to foster and maintain cooperation in the Public Goods Game by adaptively responding to the collective behavior of all players. It balances initial trust with conditional reciprocity, while protecting against exploitation.

**Strategy: Evolving Collective Reciprocity (ECR)**

**Internal State:**
*   `required_cooperation_rate`: A floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0. This represents the minimum proportion of players that must have contributed in the *previous* round for *this strategy* to contribute in the *current* round.
    *   **Initial Value for Round 2 calculations:** `required_cooperation_rate = 0.8` (This strategy starts with a relatively high expectation for collective cooperation).

---

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initiating Cooperation):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This establishes an initial cooperative stance, signaling a willingness to contribute to the public good. If all players adopt a similar starting strategy, the collective immediately benefits from high contributions, setting a positive precedent.

*   **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Response and Forgiveness):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t`, observe the actions of all `n` players from round `t-1`. Calculate `avg_contribution_last_round = (sum_j c_j^(t-1)) / n`.
    *   **My Action for Round `t`:**
        *   If `avg_contribution_last_round >= required_cooperation_rate`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   Else (`avg_contribution_last_round < required_cooperation_rate`):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Update `required_cooperation_rate` (for use in the *next* round, `t+1`):** This adaptation happens after the current round's actions are decided and observed.
        *   If `avg_contribution_last_round == 1.0`: (Everyone contributed perfectly)
            *   `required_cooperation_rate = max(0.5, required_cooperation_rate - 0.1)`
            *   *Rationale:* When cooperation is perfect, the strategy becomes slightly more forgiving, allowing for minor deviations in the future without immediate punishment. This helps maintain stability. (The minimum bound prevents it from becoming too lenient).
        *   Else if `avg_contribution_last_round >= 0.75`: (High level of cooperation)
            *   `required_cooperation_rate = max(0.6, required_cooperation_rate - 0.05)`
            *   *Rationale:* Sustained high cooperation is rewarded with slight leniency, again promoting stability. (The minimum bound prevents it from becoming too lenient).
        *   Else if `avg_contribution_last_round >= 0.5`: (Moderate cooperation, but significant free-riding)
            *   `required_cooperation_rate = min(0.9, required_cooperation_rate + 0.1)`
            *   *Rationale:* When cooperation drops to a moderate level, the strategy becomes stricter, signaling that more contribution is expected to avoid defection in the future. (The maximum bound prevents it from becoming impossible to satisfy).
        *   Else (`avg_contribution_last_round < 0.5`): (Widespread defection)
            *   `required_cooperation_rate = min(0.95, required_cooperation_rate + 0.2)`
            *   *Rationale:* In the face of widespread defection, the strategy demands a much higher level of future cooperation to re-engage, severely punishing rampant free-riding and protecting its own tokens. (The maximum bound allows for some recovery, but sets a very high bar).

*   **Round `r` (The Final Round - Exploiting the End Game):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the last round, there are no future interactions to influence behavior or build reputation. Game theory dictates that the individually rational (dominant) strategy is to defect to maximize individual payoff, as any contribution will be exploited by other players who are also likely to defect. This prevents being the "sucker" in the last round.

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by initiating with cooperation.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by always defecting.
*   **Initial `required_cooperation_rate`:** Set to 0.8 for the decision in Round 2, allowing for immediate adaptation.

---

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**
*   **Initiates Cooperation:** By starting with a contribution, the strategy actively tries to kickstart a positive collective outcome.
*   **Adaptive & Reciprocal:** The core mechanism of adjusting `required_cooperation_rate` ensures the strategy is responsive to the group's overall behavior. It effectively rewards good collective behavior (by becoming more forgiving) and punishes poor collective behavior (by becoming stricter), pushing the group towards a cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Forgiveness and Stability:** The `max()` clauses in the `required_cooperation_rate` updates prevent the strategy from becoming overly harsh (like a Grim Trigger), allowing for recovery from minor slips and enabling long-term cooperation even with some imperfections. This is crucial for sustained collective welfare.
*   **Protection Against Exploitation:** While promoting cooperation, the strategy also includes mechanisms (stricter thresholds for widespread defection, end-game defection) to protect itself from being a consistent "sucker" against purely exploitative strategies, which is necessary for robustness in a tournament context.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_45 = '''
This strategy, named "Conditional Reciprocal Contributor," aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by starting cooperatively and then adapting its behavior based on the overall level of contributions observed in the group. It is designed to be robust against defection while providing opportunities for collective benefit.

---

### **Conditional Reciprocal Contributor Strategy**

**Core Principle:** This strategy attempts to initiate cooperation and sustain it as long as the group demonstrates a reasonable level of collective contribution. It punishes insufficient cooperation to prevent exploitation and promotes the re-establishment of cooperation if conditions improve.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: number of players
*   `r`: number of rounds
*   `k`: multiplier (1 < k < n)
*   `c_j^(t-1)`: contribution of player `j` in round `t-1` (1 for Contribute, 0 for Defect)
*   `sum_j c_j^(t-1)`: total contributions in round `t-1`

---

**1. Decision Rules - When to Cooperate vs. Defect?**

*   **Rounds 1 to `r-1` (Intermediate Rounds):**
    *   **Observe Previous Contributions:** At the start of round `t` (where `1 < t < r`), examine the total contributions from the previous round (`t-1`), denoted as `C_prev = sum_j c_j^(t-1)`.
    *   **Evaluate Collective Effort:**
        *   **If `C_prev < k`:** This indicates that the total contributions in the previous round were less than the collective benefit (`k`) that a single contribution could yield. In this scenario, the collective effort is deemed insufficient, and the strategy decides to **Defect (D)** in the current round. This acts as a signal or mild punishment for low collective engagement.
        *   **Else (If `C_prev >= k`):** This indicates that the total contributions in the previous round met or exceeded the collective benefit of a single contribution. The group is demonstrating a sufficient level of cooperation, and the strategy decides to **Contribute (C)** in the current round to reciprocate and encourage continued collective welfare.

**2. Handle Edge Cases**

*   **First Round (`t=1`):**
    *   Always **Contribute (C)**. This is an initial gesture of goodwill, signaling a willingness to cooperate and giving all players a chance to establish a cooperative equilibrium from the start.

*   **Last Round (`t=r`):**
    *   Always **Defect (D)**. In the final round of a finite game with a known end, the "shadow of the future" disappears. Individual rationality dictates defecting to maximize one's own payoff without fear of future repercussions. While this might appear individually motivated, it is a robust and necessary adaptation in a competitive tournament setting to prevent exploitation by other rational agents who are also expected to defect in the final round.

**3. Alignment with Collective Mindset**

*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** The strategy starts by Contributing in the first round, proactively seeking a collectively beneficial outcome.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** It fosters cooperation by reciprocating sufficiently high collective contributions. The `C_prev >= k` threshold is chosen to ensure that the group's overall effort is meaningfully productive (at least matching the individual marginal social benefit `k`).
*   **Adaptive Punishment and Forgiveness:** By defecting when `C_prev < k`, the strategy attempts to discourage free-riding and low collective effort. However, unlike a "Grim Trigger," it is not unforgiving; if collective contributions rise above the `k` threshold again, it will resume cooperation, allowing for the re-establishment of collective welfare. This adaptive nature promotes long-term collective good by preventing permanent breakdowns.
*   **Robustness for Collective Goal:** The inclusion of the Last Round Defection, while seemingly individualistic, is crucial for the strategy's overall robustness. In a tournament against independent AI systems, a purely altruistic strategy that is easily exploited will ultimately perform poorly, undermining its ability to ever achieve or sustain any form of collective good. This strategy balances the pursuit of collective welfare with the necessity of self-preservation against rational adversaries, leading to a "rationally collective" outcome over the entire game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_46 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Cooperator (ACC)**, is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game by reciprocating the group's observed average cooperation level. It protects itself from exploitation while adapting to the finite nature of the game.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

---

**ACC Strategy Description:**

**1. Initialization (Cooperation Target Threshold):**
   *   A fixed **Cooperation Target Threshold (CTT)** is set to `0.5`. This threshold dictates that the strategy will contribute if at least 50% of the players (including itself, if it contributed) contributed in the preceding round. This value balances fostering cooperation with protecting against exploitation.

**2. Decision Rules Per Round (Current Round `t`, where `1 <= t <= r`):**

   *   **For the First Round (`t = 1`):**
       *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
       *   _Rationale:_ In the absence of any history, the strategy takes an optimistic and pro-social stance. It signals a willingness to cooperate and explores the group's initial disposition towards contributing to the public good.

   *   **For Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t < r`):**
       *   **Information Gathering:** Observe all players' actions from the **previous round (`t-1`)**.
       *   Calculate the **Group Cooperation Rate (GCR)** for the previous round:
           `GCR = (Number of players who contributed in round t-1) / n`
       *   **Decision Logic:**
           *   If `GCR >= CTT` (i.e., `GCR >= 0.5`):
               *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
               *   _Rationale:_ The group demonstrated a sufficient level of cooperation. The strategy reciprocates this positive behavior to sustain the collective effort, reinforcing beneficial group dynamics.
           *   If `GCR < CTT` (i.e., `GCR < 0.5`):
               *   **Action: Defect (D).**
               *   _Rationale:_ The group's cooperation level fell below the acceptable threshold. To prevent exploitation and signal dissatisfaction with insufficient contributions, the strategy defects. This acts as a defensive measure to avoid being a "sucker" and encourages others to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds.

   *   **For the Last Round (`t = r`):**
       *   **Action: Defect (D).**
       *   _Rationale:_ This is the "end-game effect." In a finitely repeated game, with no future interactions to incentivize cooperation, the individually rational strategy for the final round is to defect, regardless of past behavior. Cooperating in the last round would expose the strategy to exploitation without any potential for future reciprocal benefits.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Promotes Collective Welfare:** By initiating cooperation and maintaining it when group contributions are sufficiently high, ACC aims to maximize the collective benefits of the public good.
*   **Adaptive Reciprocity:** The strategy's responsiveness to the group's past actions makes it adaptive and capable of fostering cooperation with other conditional cooperators. It avoids rigid responses like "Grim Trigger" by allowing for recovery if the group's cooperation improves.
*   **Protection Against Exploitation:** By defecting when group cooperation falls below the threshold, ACC safeguards against persistent free-riding, ensuring it is not consistently exploited by non-cooperators.
*   **Transparent and Robust:** Its clear, rule-based logic, based solely on observable history, contributes to its robustness against a wide range of opponent behaviors, from always-defectors to always-cooperators and other adaptive strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_47 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Reciprocity for Public Goods," aims to maximize long-term collective welfare by promoting cooperation and deterring free-riding. It is adaptive to observed group behavior, robust to fluctuations, and explicitly handles the nuances of a finite repeated game.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocity for Public Goods

**Goal:** Foster and sustain cooperation to achieve higher collective welfare, while being resilient to exploitation and responding appropriately to observed group behavior.

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: The total number of players in the game.
*   `k`: The multiplier for contributions (where `1 < k < n`).
*   `r_max`: The total number of rounds in the game.
*   `EWMA_ALPHA`: A smoothing factor for the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) of total contributions, typically a value between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.25). A lower `EWMA_ALPHA` makes the strategy more forgiving and slower to react to changes, while a higher `EWMA_ALPHA` makes it more reactive.

**Internal State Variable (for each player, initialized before the first round):**
*   `smoothed_total_contributions`: This variable tracks the EWMA of the total contributions made by all players in previous rounds. Initialize this to `n` (an optimistic starting point assuming full potential cooperation).

**Decision Logic for Player i in the current_round:**

1.  **First Round (`current_round == 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute 1 token (C).
    *   *Rationale:* In the inaugural round, the player initiates cooperation. This acts as a clear signal of willingness to contribute to the public good and encourages others to reciprocate, aiming to "kick-start" a cooperative dynamic within the group.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < current_round < r_max`):**
    *   **Observation:** After the completion of the previous round (`current_round - 1`), observe the `total_contributions_prev` (which is the sum of contributions from *all* players in that round).
    *   **Update `smoothed_total_contributions`:**
        `smoothed_total_contributions = (EWMA_ALPHA * total_contributions_prev) + ((1 - EWMA_ALPHA) * smoothed_total_contributions)`
        *   *Rationale:* The EWMA continuously updates our perception of the group's cooperation level. This mechanism makes the strategy adaptive to evolving group dynamics and provides robustness against single-round anomalies or "mistakes," preventing immediate retaliatory spirals.
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   **If `smoothed_total_contributions >= k`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute 1 token (C).
            *   *Rationale:* If the smoothed average of past collective contributions meets or exceeds `k` (the multiplier, which represents the aggregate benefit generated by a single contribution), it indicates a sufficient level of collective engagement. In this scenario, we reciprocate by contributing, thereby sustaining and reinforcing cooperation.
        *   **Else (`smoothed_total_contributions < k`):**
            *   **Action:** Contribute 0 tokens (D).
            *   *Rationale:* If the smoothed average of collective contributions falls below `k`, it signals a lack of sufficient collective effort or a prevalence of free-riding. To avoid exploitation and to encourage greater contributions in future rounds, we defect. This acts as a conditional punishment to incentivize a return to higher cooperation.

3.  **Last Round (`current_round == r_max`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute 0 tokens (D).
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no subsequent interactions to influence through reciprocity or punishment. According to game theory, the individually rational and dominant strategy is to defect to maximize immediate personal gain, regardless of past game history or the actions of others in this specific round. Cooperating would lead to exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_48 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**, is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It balances an initial commitment to the collective good with a pragmatic, adaptive response to the behavior of other players, aiming to maximize overall group welfare over the duration of the game.

---

### **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR) Strategy**

This strategy relies on observing the collective contribution level of the group in the previous round to decide its action in the current round. It also incorporates specific behaviors for the initial and final rounds.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds

---

**1. Decision Rules - When to Contribute (C) vs. Defect (D):**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Play):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This establishes an initial signal of willingness to cooperate and commitment to the collective good, setting a positive tone for the game.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (1 < Current Round < r):**
    *   **Information Gathering:** Observe the actions of all players in the *immediately preceding round*.
    *   **Calculate Group Cooperation Rate (GCR):**
        *   `GCR = (Number of players who contributed 1 token in the previous round) / n`
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   If `GCR >= 0.6` (i.e., 60% or more of players contributed in the previous round):
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Reasoning:** When a significant portion of the group is contributing, the strategy continues to cooperate, reinforcing the collective effort and aiming to maintain a high level of public good provision.
        *   If `GCR < 0.6` (i.e., less than 60% of players contributed in the previous round):
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Reasoning:** This acts as a deterrent and a signal of dissatisfaction when collective contributions fall below an acceptable level. The aim is to incentivize other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds, thereby protecting the strategy from consistent exploitation and attempting to restore a higher GCR. This is a conditional "punishment" mechanism for the collective good.

*   **Last Round (Current Round = r):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence, eliminating the strategic incentive to cooperate. Based on backward induction, the individually dominant strategy of defection will prevail among purely rational agents. Defecting in this round prevents exploitation by opponents who would otherwise free-ride without consequence.

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by always contributing (C).
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by always defecting (D).
*   **Small `n` (Number of Players):** The `GCR >= 0.6` threshold adapts. For instance, with `n=3`, `GCR >= 0.6` means at least 2 players must contribute. With `n=2`, it means at least 2 players (i.e., both) must contribute. This scales robustly.
*   **Fluctuating Cooperation:** The strategy is designed to be adaptive. It will tolerate some defection (up to 40% of players) before resorting to defection itself, allowing for some forgiveness and promoting recovery from minor deviations.

---

**3. Alignment with the Collective Mindset:**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** The strategy initiates with a full contribution to establish a high baseline for collective welfare.
*   **Conditional Enforcement:** By linking its own contribution to the overall Group Cooperation Rate, ACR acts as an "enforcer" of collective norms. It conditionally contributes when the group shows sufficient commitment, and strategically defects to deter free-riding, thus protecting the shared resource from collapse. This is not purely self-interested defection but a mechanism to encourage better collective outcomes.
*   **Resilience and Robustness:** The 60% threshold represents a pragmatic balance: it's not so strict as to immediately punish minor deviations, allowing for potential recovery of cooperation, but it's firm enough to signal that widespread free-riding will not be tolerated. This design aims for sustainable, rather than idealistic, collective action in a competitive environment.
*   **Strategic Rationality for Collective Good:** While the strategy employs defection, particularly in the endgame, these actions are strategically chosen to prevent exploitation and maximize the overall accumulated payoff for the strategy within the tournament context, which indirectly supports the long-term viability of collective strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_49 = '''
**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**

This strategy aims to establish and sustain a high level of cooperation among players by initiating with a cooperative stance and adapting its behavior based on the collective actions observed in previous rounds. It balances the desire for collective welfare with the need to protect against free-riding.

---

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Contribute (1 token).**
    *   *Rationale:* This initiates cooperation and signals a willingness to invest in the collective good. It's an attempt to set a positive precedent for the game and establish a cooperative equilibrium.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   Observe the actions of all `n` players in the *immediately preceding round (Round t-1)*.
    *   Calculate the **Proportion of Cooperators (P_coop)** in the previous round:
        `P_coop = (Number of players who contributed 1 token in Round t-1) / n`

    *   **If P_coop ≥ 0.5 (i.e., 50% or more players contributed):**
        *   **Contribute (1 token).**
        *   *Rationale:* If a significant portion of the group is contributing, the collective effort is deemed sufficient to warrant continued cooperation. This reinforces positive behavior and encourages the maintenance of the cooperative state, which benefits all participants more than widespread defection (since `k > 1`).

    *   **If P_coop < 0.5 (i.e., less than 50% of players contributed):**
        *   **Defect (0 tokens, keep endowment).**
        *   *Rationale:* This acts as a collective punishment mechanism. If a majority of the group is free-riding, continuing to contribute individually is unsustainable and exploitative. Defecting signals that cooperation must be reciprocal to be sustained and aims to deter widespread defection in future rounds by showing that non-cooperation will lead to a collective breakdown.

*   **Round r (Last Round):**
    *   **Defect (0 tokens, keep endowment).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions for reciprocal behavior to matter. From a rational game-theoretic perspective, defecting is the dominant strategy as there are no subsequent rounds to reward cooperation or punish defection. This prevents exploitation by any purely self-interested opponents and aligns with the backward induction principle for finite repeated games.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly defined as "Contribute" to initiate cooperation.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly defined as "Defect" to prevent exploitation in the endgame.
*   **Small 'n' (number of players):**
    *   If `n=2`, `P_coop ≥ 0.5` means at least 1 player (the other player) contributed. If the other player contributed, I contribute. If they defected, `P_coop = 0 < 0.5`, so I defect. This effectively reduces to a Tit-for-Tat strategy for 2 players, which is highly robust.
*   **Large 'n':**
    *   The `0.5` threshold scales naturally with `n`, requiring a larger absolute number of cooperators for the strategy to continue cooperating. This prevents the strategy from being overly forgiving in large groups where individual defections might seem less impactful but can collectively erode trust.

---

**3. Collective Alignment:**

This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:

*   **Proactively seeking cooperation:** It starts by contributing, demonstrating a willingness to build collective welfare.
*   **Rewarding collective effort:** It continues to contribute as long as the group demonstrates a reasonable level of cooperation (50% or more). This encourages mutual benefit, as full cooperation (`k` payoff per player) is superior to full defection (`1` payoff per player, given `k > 1`).
*   **Punishing collective free-riding:** By defecting when cooperation falls below the 50% threshold, it acts as a deterrent against widespread free-riding, signaling that the collective good requires shared responsibility. This serves to restore incentives for cooperation over time.
*   **Robustness:** While aiming for collective good, it accounts for rational self-interest in the final round, ensuring it is not exploited by purely self-interested agents.

description_COLLECTIVE_50 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Reciprocity," aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by initiating contributions and then reciprocating the observed behavior of the group, while protecting against exploitation. It balances the collective good with individual robustness in a tournament setting.

---

**Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity**

This strategy operates on the principle of conditional cooperation, seeking to build and maintain trust within the group by contributing when others do, and withdrawing contributions when collective effort falters.

**1. Decision Rules: When to Cooperate vs Defect**

The decision to contribute (C) or defect (D) depends on the round number and the history of cooperation in the preceding round.

*   **Round 1 (First Round): Initiate Cooperation**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   Rationale: In the absence of prior history, this strategy takes an optimistic and cooperative stance. It signals willingness to contribute to the collective good and provides an opportunity for the group to establish a cooperative equilibrium from the outset.

*   **Rounds 2 to (r-1) (Intermediate Rounds): Reciprocate Collective Behavior**
    *   **Step 1: Observe Past Actions**
        *   Review all players' contributions (`c_j_previous_round` for all `j` from 1 to `n`) from the immediately preceding round.
    *   **Step 2: Calculate Others' Cooperation Rate**
        *   Determine the total contributions from all *other* players in the previous round:
            `Total_Others_Contributions_Previous_Round = (sum of c_j_previous_round for all j) - (this player's c_i_previous_round)`
        *   Calculate the average cooperation rate of other players:
            `Average_Others_Cooperation_Rate = Total_Others_Contributions_Previous_Round / (n - 1)`
    *   **Step 3: Apply Cooperation Threshold**
        *   **If `Average_Others_Cooperation_Rate >= 0.5` (Cooperation Threshold):**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   Rationale: If a significant portion (more than half) of the other players contributed, it indicates a sufficient level of collective effort. This strategy continues to contribute to reinforce and sustain this cooperative behavior, aiming for the higher collective payoff.
        *   **If `Average_Others_Cooperation_Rate < 0.5` (Cooperation Threshold):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**
            *   Rationale: If cooperation from others drops below a critical level, this strategy defects. This serves as a defensive measure to avoid being exploited by free-riders and as a signal that a higher level of group contribution is required to maintain this player's cooperation. This acts as a punishment mechanism.

*   **Round r (Last Round): Anticipate End-Game Defection**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   Rationale: In the final round of a finitely repeated game, the incentive for future cooperation disappears. Individually rational players will typically defect to maximize their final payoff and avoid exploitation, as there are no subsequent rounds for punishment or reward. While this deviates from pure collective altruism, it is a robust and self-preserving choice given the tournament context where opponents' rationality and lack of shared norms are assumed. This prevents being a "sucker" in the inevitable end-game unraveling.

**2. Handle Edge Cases**

*   **First Round (`r=1`):** As specified, the strategy contributes (C).
*   **Game with `r=1`:** The "First Round" rule applies, and the strategy contributes (C). There are no intermediate or last rounds to consider.
*   **Game with `r=2`:** The strategy would play C in Round 1 (First Round rule) and D in Round 2 (Last Round rule).
*   **Small `n` (e.g., `n=2`):** The `Average_Others_Cooperation_Rate` calculation correctly reduces to evaluating the single other player's contribution (e.g., `Other_Player_C / 1`), effectively becoming a Tit-for-Tat strategy for a two-player scenario, which is known to be robust.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment**

This strategy is aligned with a collective mindset in several ways:

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** It actively attempts to kickstart cooperation by contributing in the first round, aiming for the collective benefit.
*   **Sustains Cooperation:** It continues to contribute as long as the majority of the group shows willingness to cooperate, reinforcing positive group dynamics.
*   **Promotes Reciprocity:** By conditioning its actions on others' behavior, it implicitly encourages other players to contribute, knowing that their contributions will be reciprocated. This drives the group towards higher overall contributions over the game's duration.
*   **Adaptive Recovery:** It allows for the collective to recover from periods of low cooperation; if defectors return to contributing, this strategy will also resume its contributions, fostering a dynamic and resilient cooperative environment.
*   **Robust Collective Play:** While it defects in the final round for self-preservation, this choice is a strategic adaptation to the known game structure rather than an abandonment of the collective goal. For the vast majority of the game (rounds 1 to r-1), it actively works to maximize the collective payoff by promoting and sustaining cooperation.

This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**, is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It balances initial trust with conditional reciprocity, adapting to the overall level of cooperation observed in the group, and acknowledges the unique dynamics of the end-game.

---

## Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR) Strategy Description

This strategy aims to maximize collective welfare by promoting cooperation, but also protects itself from sustained exploitation by defectors. It bases its decisions on the history of collective contributions.

### Strategy Parameters:
*   `initial_trust_rounds = 1`: The number of initial rounds during which the strategy will always contribute, to signal willingness to cooperate.
*   `cooperation_threshold_fraction = 0.7`: The minimum fraction of players that must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to continue cooperating. For example, if `n=10`, at least 7 players (10 * 0.7 = 7) must have contributed. If `n=4`, at least 3 players (`ceil(4 * 0.7) = 3`) must have contributed. This threshold balances leniency with protection against widespread defection.
*   `endgame_defection_rounds = 2`: The number of final rounds during which the strategy will always defect, acknowledging the strong incentives for defection at the game's conclusion due to backward induction.

### Decision Rules (Action for Player `i` in Round `t`):

**1. Initial Trust Phase (Rounds `t` from 1 to `initial_trust_rounds`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Reason:** This strategy begins by demonstrating an unconditional willingness to cooperate. This signals trust and provides an opportunity for other players to establish a cooperative baseline, aiming to initiate a positive cycle of contributions.

**2. Adaptive Cooperation Phase (Rounds `t` from `initial_trust_rounds + 1` up to `r - endgame_defection_rounds`):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t`, review the actions of all players from the previous round (`t-1`). Calculate `num_C_prev`, the total number of players who contributed in round `t-1`.
    *   **Calculation:** Determine the `observed_cooperation_fraction = num_C_prev / n`.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `observed_cooperation_fraction >= cooperation_threshold_fraction`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Reason:** The group demonstrated sufficient collective cooperation in the previous round. This strategy reciprocates by continuing to contribute, rewarding collective effort and sustaining cooperation.
        *   **Else (if `observed_cooperation_fraction < cooperation_threshold_fraction`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reason:** A significant portion of the group defected in the previous round. This strategy responds by defecting, acting as a collective punishment for insufficient cooperation. This signal aims to discourage free-riding and encourages players to re-evaluate their actions to restore collective contributions in subsequent rounds. It's a collective "Tit-for-Tat"-like response.

**3. Endgame Defection Phase (Rounds `t` from `r - endgame_defection_rounds + 1` to `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reason:** As the game approaches its final rounds, the incentives for individual defection become overwhelmingly strong, irrespective of past cooperation. This strategy acknowledges this reality and defects to protect itself from exploitation by others who will likely also defect.

### Edge Cases and Collective Alignment:

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by the "Initial Trust Phase" – always contributes to initiate cooperation.
*   **Last Rounds:** Explicitly handled by the "Endgame Defection Phase" – defaults to defection to avoid exploitation. If `r` is very small, say `r <= endgame_defection_rounds`, then all rounds will fall into the Endgame Defection Phase, except for Round 1 if `initial_trust_rounds` is 1 and `r > 1`. If `r=1`, it will contribute in Round 1 due to `initial_trust_rounds=1`.
*   **Collective Mindset:**
    *   The strategy actively promotes collective welfare by starting with a cooperative gesture and continuing to cooperate as long as the majority of players are also contributing.
    *   Its adaptive nature is designed to "teach" the group that collective contributions are rewarded, and widespread defection is punished. This encourages a stable equilibrium of high cooperation.
    *   The `cooperation_threshold_fraction` is a key parameter that ensures the strategy is not overly exploitable (too lenient) nor overly punitive (too strict), striking a balance that aims for the common good while being robust in a tournament setting.

description_COLLECTIVE_52 = '''
Here is a collective strategy designed for the Public Goods Game, emphasizing adaptive reciprocity, forgiveness, and robust performance in a tournament setting.

---

**Strategy Name: Dynamic Group Reciprocity**

This strategy aims to initiate and maintain the collectively optimal outcome (all players contributing) by being initially cooperative, adaptively responding to group contributions, and incorporating both punishment for widespread defection and forgiveness to re-establish cooperation. It explicitly accounts for the finite nature of the game.

**Internal Parameters (configurable based on `n`, `k`, `r`):**

*   `initial_cooperation_rounds`: (Integer) The number of initial rounds (e.g., 2) during which the player always contributes, regardless of others' actions. This establishes trust and signals a cooperative intent.
*   `punishment_duration`: (Integer) The number of rounds (e.g., 1) this player will defect *consecutively* once a punishment phase is triggered. A value of 1 means a single round of defection before re-testing cooperation.
*   `current_punishment_counter`: (Integer, initialized to 0) An internal counter tracking how many rounds this player has been actively defecting as part of a punishment phase.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 to `initial_cooperation_rounds` (Establishing Trust):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   **Rationale:** Proactively demonstrate a collective mindset by contributing. This is a crucial step to signal willingness to cooperate and to give all players a clear opportunity to establish a high-payoff collective equilibrium from the outset.

2.  **Rounds `initial_cooperation_rounds` + 1 to `r-1` (Adaptive Group Response):**
    *   Let `total_contributions_prev` be the sum of all players' contributions in the *previous* round.
    *   Calculate the **Average Contribution Ratio (ACR)** for the group in the previous round: `ACR_prev = total_contributions_prev / n`.

    *   **A. Active Punishment Phase:**
        *   **If `current_punishment_counter > 0`:**
            *   **If `current_punishment_counter < punishment_duration`:**
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**
                *   **Rationale:** Continue the active punishment phase to reinforce the signal against low cooperation. Increment `current_punishment_counter`.
            *   **Else (`current_punishment_counter >= punishment_duration`):**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
                *   **Rationale:** The punitive phase has completed its course. Attempt to re-establish cooperation, demonstrating a willingness to forgive past defections and re-test the group's intent. Reset `current_punishment_counter = 0`.

    *   **B. Evaluating Group Cooperation (No Active Punishment):**
        *   **Else (`current_punishment_counter == 0`):**
            *   **If `ACR_prev >= 0.9` (High Collective Cooperation):**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
                *   **Rationale:** The group is highly cooperative. Continue contributing to sustain this near-optimal collective benefit and ensure the highest possible payoffs for all.
            *   **Else if `ACR_prev < 0.5` (Low Collective Cooperation):**
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**
                *   **Rationale:** The group's cooperation level is significantly low, indicating prevalent free-riding. Initiate a punishment phase to deter further exploitation and signal that cooperation requires reciprocity. Set `current_punishment_counter = 1`.
            *   **Else (`0.5 <= ACR_prev < 0.9`, Moderate Collective Cooperation):**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
                *   **Rationale:** In moderately cooperative environments, lean towards contributing. This encourages others to increase their contributions towards full cooperation, rather than immediately punishing, thus fostering a more resilient collective state.

3.  **Round `r` (Final Round Exploitation):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finitely repeated game, the principle of backward induction dictates that there are no future interactions for reciprocal actions. The individually dominant strategy is to defect to maximize personal payoff without risk of future retribution.

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** The strategy begins with `initial_cooperation_rounds` of contributing, demonstrating a strong intent to build and sustain collective welfare.
*   **Adaptive Response:** It adapts to observed group behavior, rewarding high cooperation and punishing low cooperation, which are both mechanisms to stabilize a cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Forgiveness:** After a period of punishment, the strategy re-tests cooperation, preventing indefinite defection cycles and allowing the group to return to higher payoffs.
*   **Generous Thresholds:** The thresholds (e.g., `ACR_prev >= 0.9` for high cooperation, `ACR_prev < 0.5` for low cooperation) are set to be somewhat generous, tolerating a degree of non-cooperation before punishing, and actively supporting cooperation even in moderately cooperative scenarios.
*   **Robustness:** By adapting to a wide range of `ACR_prev` values and incorporating an endgame strategy, it is designed to perform robustly against various opponent strategies, from always defecting to consistently cooperating.

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_53 = '''
Here is a natural language strategy description for the Public Goods Game (PGG):

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Reciprocation (ACR)**

**Core Philosophy:** This strategy aims to foster and sustain high levels of group cooperation. It begins with an act of trust, then adaptively reciprocates the observed cooperation levels within the group. It is designed to be forgiving of minor, non-persistent defections to prevent spirals of uncooperativeness, but will punish significant or persistent exploitation to protect itself and re-establish a collective norm. It prioritizes the collective mindset while remaining robust in a competitive tournament setting.

**Game Parameters Utilized:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier

**Strategy Parameters (derived/fixed):**
*   `Cooperation_Sustain_Threshold`: `(n - 2)`
    *   This is the minimum number of *other* players who must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to consider contributing (allowing for up to two other players to defect without immediate punishment). For `n=2`, this effectively means `0`, so if the other player cooperates, this strategy cooperates.
*   `Defection_Streak_Threshold`: `2` rounds
    *   A player is considered a "persistent defector" if they have defected in `2` consecutive rounds.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initiate Trust):**
    *   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This signals an initial willingness to cooperate and attempts to establish a cooperative foundation for the group. It's a fundamental step in building collective welfare.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to `r-1`):**

    *   **Observe History (from the previous round `t-1`):**
        *   `num_other_cooperators_last_round`: Count the number of players (excluding yourself) who contributed in round `t-1`.
        *   `any_persistent_defector`: Determine if *any* individual player (excluding yourself) has defected in *both* round `t-1` AND round `t-2` (this check only applies from round 3 onwards; for round 2, only `t-1` defection is considered for `persistent_defector` status).

    *   **Decision for Current Round `t`:**
        *   **A. Strong Collective Cooperation:**
            *   **IF `num_other_cooperators_last_round >= (n - 1)`:**
                *   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** Reinforce near-perfect cooperation. When almost everyone is contributing, it is in the collective interest to continue and maintain this high level of welfare.
        *   **B. Moderate Cooperation & Forgiveness:**
            *   **ELSE IF `num_other_cooperators_last_round >= Cooperation_Sustain_Threshold` AND `NOT any_persistent_defector`:**
                *   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** Show forgiveness for minor, non-persistent lapses in cooperation. This prevents defection spirals that can occur from reacting too harshly to individual mistakes or one-off defections, thereby encouraging recovery and sustained collective action.
        *   **C. Low Cooperation or Persistent Exploitation:**
            *   **ELSE (i.e., `num_other_cooperators_last_round < Cooperation_Sustain_Threshold` OR `any_persistent_defector` is True):**
                *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** Punish significant breakdowns in cooperation or identified exploiters. This protects your own endowment from free-riders and signals that widespread defection or persistent exploitation will not be tolerated, aiming to reset the group's cooperation level for future rounds.

3.  **Last Round (`r`):**

    *   **Observe History (from the previous round `r-1`):**
        *   `num_other_cooperators_last_round`: Count the number of players (excluding yourself) who contributed in round `r-1`.

    *   **Decision for Last Round `r`:**
        *   **IF `num_other_cooperators_last_round >= (n - 1)`:**
            *   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** Uphold the collective ideal until the very end. If the group has achieved and sustained a high level of cooperation, this strategy will maintain its commitment, prioritizing the collective's historical effort even in the shadow of the game's conclusion.
        *   **ELSE:**
            *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If collective cooperation has not been robust or has broken down by the final stages of the game, protect your own endowment against further exploitation in the last round.

---

**Strategy: Dynamic Collective Reciprocity**

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Initialization (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This action serves as an initial signal of willingness to cooperate and provides an opportunity for all players to observe and reciprocate. It sets an optimistic tone for collective action.

*   **Regular Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`):**
    *   At the beginning of each round, observe the actions of all players from the *immediately preceding round*.
    *   Let `C_prev` be the number of players who contributed (`c_j = 1`) in the previous round.
    *   Calculate the **cooperation rate** for the previous round: `coop_rate = C_prev / n`.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `coop_rate == 1` (Full Cooperation):**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* When all players contributed, the collective optimum is achieved. Continue contributing to maintain this highly beneficial state.
        *   **Else if `coop_rate >= 0.7` (High Cooperation):**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* If a significant majority (70% or more) of players are cooperating, continue to contribute. This rewards high levels of collective effort and sustains the positive momentum, even if not perfect.
        *   **Else if `coop_rate >= 0.3` (Moderate Cooperation - Attempt to Recover):**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* This is a key aspect of the "collective" and "adaptive" mindset. Even if cooperation is faltering (between 30% and 70%), this strategy chooses to contribute. It acts as an attempt to lead by example, offer forgiveness for minor deviations, and provide an opportunity for the group to recover towards higher cooperation levels. This avoids an immediate collapse into defection from moderate setbacks.
        *   **Else (`coop_rate < 0.3` - Low/Widespread Defection):**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* If cooperation has largely broken down and widespread free-riding is occurring (less than 30% contribution), contributing would lead to significant exploitation. Defecting signals that such low collective effort is unsustainable and acts as a strong disincentive, potentially shocking the system towards improved cooperation in subsequent rounds.

**2. Handle Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled above by always contributing (C).
*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. Therefore, the dominant individual strategy is to defect (free-ride) to maximize one's own payoff, as there are no long-term consequences. This prevents being exploited by other players who will likely defect in the final round.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by:

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** Starting with a contribution to initiate collective welfare.
*   **Sustaining High Cooperation:** Maintaining cooperation when the group is performing well.
*   **Forgiveness and Leadership:** Actively attempting to re-establish cooperation even when it's only moderately successful, rather than immediately punishing. This demonstrates a commitment to the collective good by providing chances for recovery.
*   **Strategic Punishment:** Resorting to defection only when cooperation has severely deteriorated, serving as a robust mechanism to prevent sustained exploitation and to signal the need for a fundamental shift in collective behavior. This ensures the strategy is not a "sucker" while still striving for overall group benefit.

description_COLLECTIVE_55 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity**, aims to foster widespread cooperation in the Public Goods Game while remaining robust against exploitation. It balances the pursuit of collective welfare with the need for self-protection in a competitive tournament setting.

---

**Adaptive Collective Reciprocity Strategy**

This strategy relies on observing the collective behavior of all players in previous rounds to inform its current decision. It is designed to be adaptive, encourage cooperation, and protect itself from free-riders, particularly towards the game's end.

**Game Parameters Utilized:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `total_rounds`: The total number of rounds in the game.

**Internal Parameter:**
*   `Threshold_C = 0.5`: This is the critical threshold for the average contribution rate. If the proportion of players who contributed in the previous round meets or exceeds this value, the strategy will continue to cooperate. Otherwise, it will signal dissatisfaction by defecting.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Opening Move):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy initiates with cooperation to signal its willingness to contribute to the public good and to establish a cooperative baseline. This acts as an "invitation" for others to cooperate.

2.  **Last Round (`current_round == total_rounds`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. The individual incentive to defect becomes dominant as there is no "shadow of the future" to enforce cooperation. This preempts exploitation by opponents who are likely to defect in the last round.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < current_round < total_rounds`):**
    *   **Observation:** At the start of each intermediate round, the strategy observes the actions of all players from the immediately preceding round (`current_round - 1`).
    *   **Calculation:**
        *   Count the total number of players who contributed (`c_j = 1`) in the previous round. Let this be `P_prev`.
        *   Calculate the average contribution rate: `avg_C_rate = P_prev / n`.
    *   **Conditional Action:**
        *   **If `avg_C_rate >= Threshold_C` (i.e., 50% or more players contributed in the previous round):**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** A sufficient level of collective cooperation was observed. The strategy continues to contribute to sustain this collective welfare and reward cooperative behavior.
        *   **Else (`avg_C_rate < Threshold_C`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** The collective contribution rate has fallen below the acceptable threshold. This indicates that cooperation is insufficient, and the strategy defects to signal dissatisfaction, punish free-riders, and protect its endowment. This action implicitly encourages a return to higher cooperation in future rounds by demonstrating that low cooperation will not be tolerated.

**Edge Case Handling:**
*   **First Round:** Specifically handled by initiating cooperation.
*   **Last Round:** Specifically handled by switching to defection.
*   **Intermediate Rounds:** Covered by the conditional rule based on the previous round's collective contribution.

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**
*   The strategy actively promotes collective welfare by starting with cooperation and maintaining it when others reciprocate.
*   It sets a clear, collective expectation (`Threshold_C = 0.5`) for participation, indicating that it is willing to contribute as long as a significant portion of the group does its part.
*   By defecting when collective cooperation falters, it provides a feedback mechanism designed to discourage widespread free-riding and potentially guide the group back towards a more cooperative state, rather than passively accepting exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_56 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Collective Reciprocator," aims to foster and sustain collective contribution to the public good, while remaining adaptive and robust against various opponent behaviors.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initiation):**
    *   **Action:** Always Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Begin by signaling a willingness to contribute to the public good. This acts as an initial overture to cooperation, giving the group a chance to establish a cooperative environment for the benefit of all, aligning with a collective mindset.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Response Phase):**

        *   Let `my_contribution_t-1` be this strategy's own action in round `t-1` (1 if C, 0 if D).
        *   Let `total_contributions_t-1` be the sum of all players' contributions in round `t-1`.
        *   Calculate `proportion_others_cooperated = (total_contributions_t-1 - my_contribution_t-1) / (n - 1)`.
    *   **Action:**
        *   If `proportion_others_cooperated >= 0.5` (i.e., at least half of the other players contributed in the previous round), then Contribute (C).
        *   Else (fewer than half of the other players contributed), then Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** This rule implements a form of generalized reciprocity. It rewards collective effort by continuing to contribute if a majority of the group is participating. Conversely, it withdraws support (defects) if the collective effort is significantly underperforming (below 50% participation from others), thus protecting against exploitation and signaling that collective benefit requires sufficient collective participation. The 0.5 threshold provides a clear, robust benchmark for assessing collective viability.

3.  **Round `r` (Final Round):**
    *   **Action:** Always Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no subsequent rounds for punishment or reward. Game theory dictates that defection becomes the dominant strategy for individual payoff maximization. Defecting in this round prevents exploitation by other players who are likely to employ the same game-theoretic reasoning.

**Summary of Collective Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy embodies a collective mindset by proactively initiating cooperation and sustaining it when the group demonstrates sufficient mutual support. It actively promotes collective welfare by contributing to the public good under favorable conditions. However, it is also "adaptive and robust" by pragmatically protecting itself from exploitation when collective efforts fail, and by acknowledging the finite horizon's impact on rational behavior in the final round to avoid being a "sucker." This balance ensures its long-term viability in a competitive tournament setting.

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Reciprocator (ACR)**

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributed tokens (1 < k < n).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1: Initial Overture of Trust**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy begins with a cooperative contribution to signal its willingness to invest in the collective good and to initiate a positive cycle of contributions within the group. This acts as an exploratory gesture to assess the cooperative potential of other players.

2.  **Rounds 2 to (r-1): Adaptive Conditional Cooperation**
    *   At the beginning of each round `t` (where `1 < t < r`), the strategy reviews the collective behavior from the immediate previous round (`t-1`).
    *   **Observation:**
        *   Let `C_prev` be the total sum of contributions made by *all* players (including self, if applicable) in round `t-1`.
    *   **Cooperation Threshold (T):**
        *   The strategy calculates a dynamic threshold based on the number of players. `T = ceil(n / 2)`. This threshold dictates that a simple majority of players must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to continue cooperating. This value is chosen to strike a balance: it demands enough collective effort to make cooperation meaningful, but is not so stringent that minor defections immediately collapse cooperation.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `C_prev >= T`: **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** A sufficient number of players demonstrated cooperative behavior. The strategy reciprocates this collective effort to sustain and reinforce the beneficial cycle of contributions, aiming for the higher collective payoff.
        *   Else (`C_prev < T`): **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** The observed collective cooperation was below the acceptable threshold. Continuing to contribute in such circumstances would lead to exploitation by free-riders. Defecting serves as a signal that a higher level of collective effort is required, acting as a gentle collective punishment to encourage more contributions in subsequent rounds, while also protecting the strategy's own payoff.

3.  **Round r: End-Game Rationality**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, the "shadow of the future" disappears. There are no subsequent rounds to incentivize reciprocal behavior or to punish defection. The individually rational strategy for all players becomes defection, as contributing would result in an immediate net loss (1 - k/n) without any future benefit. This ensures the strategy avoids exploitation by others who are likely to defect in the last round.

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**
The ACR strategy prioritizes fostering and maintaining high levels of contributions. It initiates cooperation, rewards collective effort, and punishes (via temporary defection) significant deviations from cooperative norms. While it includes a final-round defection for strategic robustness, its core objective throughout the game is to lead towards the collective optimum where all players contribute and achieve the maximum group payoff of `k` per player.

**Robustness and Adaptability:**
*   **Adaptive:** It dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective actions of the group in the preceding round.
*   **Robust:**
    *   It is parameter-agnostic to `k` (beyond `1 < k < n`) and adapts to `n` via its threshold calculation.
    *   It can initiate and sustain cooperation with other similarly minded strategies.
    *   It protects against sustained exploitation by immediately reverting to defection when cooperation drops below a critical mass.
    *   It anticipates and handles the well-known end-game effect to prevent unnecessary losses.
    *   It does not require prior communication or explicit coordination, relying solely on observable past actions.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC)

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initialization & Signaling):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Begin by contributing to signal willingness to cooperate and to test the cooperative inclination of other players. This acts as an initial gesture of good faith, essential for establishing a high-cooperation equilibrium.

2.  **Rounds 2 to (r-1) (Adaptive Conditional Play):**
    *   Let `total_contributions_previous_round` be the sum of contributions from all `n` players in the immediately preceding round.
    *   Calculate the **Cooperation Threshold:** `T = ceil(n / k)`.
        *   **Rationale:** This threshold represents the minimum number of contributions required in a round for the public good to return at least 1 unit *per contribution* to the collective. If fewer than `T` players contribute, the collective investment is inefficient, yielding less than the initial individual endowment even after multiplication. This threshold is dynamic, reflecting how beneficial cooperation is: if `k` is high (near `n`), `T` will be low (e.g., 2), making the strategy more forgiving; if `k` is low (near 1), `T` will be high (near `n`), requiring near-universal cooperation to justify continued contribution.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `total_contributions_previous_round >= T`: **Contribute (C).**
            *   **Rationale:** The collective demonstrated sufficient commitment to cooperation in the previous round, making continued contribution collectively beneficial and individually justifiable to maintain the cooperative state.
        *   Else (`total_contributions_previous_round < T`): **Defect (D).**
            *   **Rationale:** The collective contribution level was too low to be efficient or sustainable. Defecting serves as a defensive measure against exploitation and as a signal that the current level of cooperation is unacceptable. It protects the player from being a "sucker" and incentivizes other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds if they wish to re-establish a cooperative state.

3.  **Round r (Final Round - Endgame Effect):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to influence or to build reputation for. The dominant strategy for any rational player in a single-round Public Goods Game is to defect, as there are no consequences for future rounds. This decision maximizes individual payoff in the immediate final round.

---

**Collective Alignment & Robustness:**

*   **Collective Mindset:** The strategy actively seeks to achieve and maintain a high level of collective welfare by promoting cooperation. It starts cooperatively and continues to cooperate as long as the observed collective effort meets a sustainable threshold derived from the game's core parameters (`k/n`).
*   **Adaptivity:** The strategy is highly adaptive, adjusting its behavior based on the observed actions of *all* other players in the previous round. This allows it to respond dynamically to changing group dynamics.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Against Persistent Defectors:** If opponents consistently defect, `total_contributions_previous_round` will fall below `T`, leading this strategy to defect and minimize losses, preventing exploitation.
    *   **Against Occasional Defection:** The `ceil(n/k)` threshold allows for a certain degree of defection if `k` is high, meaning it is forgiving enough to not immediately collapse cooperation due to minor deviations.
    *   **Against Other Cooperative Strategies:** When playing against other strategies that also seek cooperation, ACC will readily cooperate, leading to high collective payoffs for all participants.
    *   **Re-establishment of Cooperation:** If defection occurs, but then other players start contributing above `T` again, the strategy will revert to cooperation, allowing for the re-establishment of a beneficial equilibrium.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_59 = '''
Here is a collective strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed for robustness and adaptiveness in a tournament setting:

## Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocator with End-Game Logic

This strategy aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by initiating contributions and then adaptively responding to the observed level of cooperation from other players, while employing rational behavior in the final round to prevent exploitation.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (where `1 < k < n`)

**Information Available:**
*   After each round, all players observe every player's past actions (contributions) and payoffs.

---

### 1. Decision Rules: When to Contribute (C) vs. Defect (D)

The decision rules are based on the current round number and the observed collective behavior in the previous round.

*   **Round 1 (Initiation Phase):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This establishes the strategy's willingness to cooperate from the outset, signaling an intent to build a collectively beneficial outcome. It acts as an open invitation for others to cooperate.

*   **Rounds 2 to (r-1) (Adaptive Reciprocity Phase):**
    *   **Information Gathering:** Observe `N_C_prev`, which is the total number of players who contributed in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   **Cooperation Threshold Calculation:** Define `CooperationThreshold = ceil(n / 2)`. This threshold represents the minimum number of contributors required to signify a robust level of collective cooperation.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `N_C_prev >= CooperationThreshold`:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If a clear majority (or exactly half, for even `n`) of players demonstrated cooperation in the previous round, this strategy reciprocates their effort. By continuing to contribute, it rewards collective behavior, aims to sustain a high level of overall contributions, and thereby maximizes collective welfare.
        *   **Else (`N_C_prev < CooperationThreshold`):** **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If the observed cooperation level falls below the critical mass, this strategy defects. This prevents exploitation by free-riders and signals to other players that a higher level of collective effort is required to maintain cooperation. It acts as a punishment mechanism, encouraging others to contribute more in subsequent rounds if they wish to see continued cooperation.

*   **Round r (End-Game Rationality Phase):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions or opportunities for reciprocity, punishment, or building further cooperation. Under such circumstances, individual defection becomes the dominant strategy to maximize one's own payoff and avoid being exploited by others who will also rationally defect.

### 2. Edge Cases Handled

*   **First Round (Round 1):** Explicitly handled by the "Initiation Phase" rule: Always Contribute.
*   **Last Round (Round r):** Explicitly handled by the "End-Game Rationality Phase" rule: Always Defect.
*   **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):** Covered by the "Adaptive Reciprocity Phase" rules, which adjust based on observed history.

### 3. Collective Alignment

This strategy embodies a conditional cooperation framework designed to promote and sustain high collective welfare:

*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** It takes the first step by contributing in Round 1, acting as a catalyst for a cooperative environment.
*   **Reward and Maintenance:** It consistently rewards sufficient collective cooperation by continuing its contributions, thus reinforcing positive behavior and maintaining a higher overall pool of contributions.
*   **Discouragement of Free-Riding:** By defecting when cooperation drops below a critical threshold, it signals dissatisfaction with low contributions, preventing itself from being a "sucker" and nudging the collective towards greater participation.
*   **Strategic Adaptability:** The reliance on `N_C_prev` and the `ceil(n/2)` threshold makes the strategy robust across various group sizes (`n`) and dynamic enough to adapt to different mixtures of opponent strategies, fostering cooperation where possible and protecting against exploitation where it is not.
*   **Rational Self-Preservation:** The end-game defection is a pragmatic choice that aligns with individual rationality in a finite game, which is crucial for overall performance in a tournament setting where individual scores matter.

By balancing an initial willingness to cooperate with a robust mechanism for conditional reciprocity and end-game rationality, this strategy aims to maximize its own payoff while simultaneously striving for the highest possible collective outcome.

description_COLLECTIVE_60 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity with Forgiveness," aims to foster and maintain collective cooperation by adapting to observed behaviors, while safeguarding against persistent exploitation. It prioritizes establishing cooperation, reacting reciprocally to the group's actions, and attempting to re-establish cooperation if it breaks down.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Reciprocity with Forgiveness

**Internal State (for this AI player):**
*   `my_rounds_since_last_cooperation`: An integer counter, initialized to 0. This tracks how many consecutive rounds this player has defected since its last contribution.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for total contributions.

**Key Thresholds:**
*   `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD = 0.5`: The minimum proportion of players that must have contributed in the previous round to incentivize this player to cooperate. (e.g., if `n=4`, at least 2 players must have cooperated).
*   `FORGIVENESS_INTERVAL = 3`: If this player has defected for this many consecutive rounds, it will attempt to cooperate in the next round as a gesture of re-engagement, regardless of past collective behavior.

---

**Decision Rules:**

**1. First Round (current_round = 1):**
   *   **Action:** Cooperate (C).
   *   **Reasoning:** Begin with a cooperative stance to signal willingness to contribute to the public good and to encourage others to do the same.
   *   **State Update:** Reset `my_rounds_since_last_cooperation` to 0.

**2. Last Round (current_round = r):**
   *   **Action:** Defect (D).
   *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. Contributing would cost 1 token while yielding a personal benefit of `k/n` (which is less than 1). Therefore, defecting is the individually rational choice.

**3. Middle Rounds (1 < current_round < r):**

   **a. Forgiveness Check:**
      *   If `my_rounds_since_last_cooperation >= FORGIVENESS_INTERVAL`:
          *   **Action:** Cooperate (C).
          *   **Reasoning:** Even if collective cooperation has been low, attempting to cooperate after a period of defection serves as a "test of waters" or a generous re-attempt to break out of a mutual defection cycle and potentially re-ignite collective cooperation.
          *   **State Update:** Reset `my_rounds_since_last_cooperation` to 0.
      *   Else (If not in a forgiveness attempt): Proceed to the Standard Reciprocity check.

   **b. Standard Reciprocity Check:**
      *   **Observation:** Observe `C_prev`, the total number of players who contributed in the previous round.
      *   **Calculation:** Calculate `Proportion_C_prev = C_prev / n`.
      *   **Decision:**
          *   If `Proportion_C_prev >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
              *   **Action:** Cooperate (C).
              *   **Reasoning:** The collective is demonstrating sufficient cooperation. This player reciprocates to maintain the beneficial cooperative equilibrium.
              *   **State Update:** Reset `my_rounds_since_last_cooperation` to 0.
          *   Else (`Proportion_C_prev < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):
              *   **Action:** Defect (D).
              *   **Reasoning:** The level of collective cooperation is too low. This player defects to protect against being exploited by free-riders and to signal dissatisfaction, potentially prompting others to increase their contributions.
              *   **State Update:** Increment `my_rounds_since_last_cooperation` by 1.

The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Sustenance," aims to foster and maintain collective welfare by promoting cooperation, adapting to observed behavior, and protecting against persistent free-riding. It relies on the game parameters and historical actions to guide decisions.

---

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Sustenance**

**Goal:** To maximize the total collective welfare by achieving and sustaining high levels of cooperation among players, while dynamically responding to the group's contribution behavior.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1: Probing for Cooperation**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy initiates with a contribution to signal its willingness to cooperate and to "test the waters" for collective action. This proactive stance provides an opportunity for all players to establish a cooperative equilibrium from the outset.

*   **Rounds 2 to (r-1): Adaptive Collective Sustenance**
    *   At the end of the previous round (`t-1`), the strategy observes the actions of all players (including itself).
    *   It calculates `N_C_prev`, which is the total number of players (from 1 to `n`) who contributed 1 token in round `t-1`.
    *   A dynamic **"Cooperation Threshold"** is defined based on the game parameter `k`:
        `Threshold_N_C = floor(k)`
        *(Note: Since `1 < k < n`, `Threshold_N_C` will always be at least 1 and less than `n`.)*
    *   **Decision Rule for Round t:**
        *   **If `N_C_prev >= Threshold_N_C`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If the number of cooperators in the previous round met or exceeded the `floor(k)` threshold, it indicates a sufficient level of collective action to warrant continued cooperation. This rule promotes and sustains cooperation. The specific value of `k` means:
                *   For lower `k` (e.g., `k=2.1`, `Threshold_N_C = 2`), the strategy is more forgiving, allowing cooperation to persist even with a smaller number of contributors. This encourages the collective to build cooperation from a modest base when individual incentives to defect are strong.
                *   For higher `k` (e.g., `k=8.9`, `Threshold_N_C = 8`), the strategy is stricter, requiring a higher degree of collective contribution to maintain cooperation. This pushes the group towards maximizing gains when the potential collective benefits are substantial.
        *   **Else (If `N_C_prev < Threshold_N_C`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If the number of cooperators falls below the `floor(k)` threshold, it signals a significant breakdown in collective effort or an unacceptable level of free-riding. Defecting in this scenario serves as a protective measure against exploitation and acts as a signal to other players that higher contributions are needed to restore collective cooperation.

*   **Round r (Final Round): Endgame Rationality**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finitely repeated game, there are no future interactions for reputation building or consequences for defection. The dominant individual strategy is to defect, as contributing would incur a cost without any subsequent strategic benefit. This rule prevents the strategy from being exploited in the game's concluding stage.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly covered by the "Probing for Cooperation" rule, initiating with a contribution.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly covered by the "Endgame Rationality" rule, defecting to optimize individual payoff when there are no future implications.
*   **Intermediate Rounds:** Fully managed by the "Adaptive Collective Sustenance" rules, making decisions based on the observed history and game parameters.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

The "Adaptive Collective Sustenance" strategy is designed with a collective mindset:
*   It proactively attempts to initiate and establish cooperation through its first-round contribution.
*   Its core adaptive mechanism is directly tied to the multiplier `k`, which quantifies the collective benefit of contributions. This ensures that the strategy's tolerance for non-cooperation is dynamically scaled by how beneficial cooperation is to the group.
*   By being more forgiving when `k` is low (making collective action harder to sustain) and more demanding when `k` is high (where collective action yields greater rewards), the strategy consistently aims to maximize the overall contributions and thus the collective payoff.
*   It provides a clear pathway for re-establishing cooperation if collective contributions improve, while also protecting against persistent exploitation through conditional defection.
*   The final round defection is a rational response to the game's finite structure and does not undermine the collective-oriented adaptive behavior in preceding rounds.

The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Contributor" (ACC), is designed to promote and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game, aiming for high collective welfare while remaining robust against exploitation in a tournament setting. It adapts its behavior based on the observed collective contribution in previous rounds and game parameters.

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC)

**Description:**
The Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC) strategy is a conditional cooperator that leverages the game parameters to dynamically set expectations for collective participation. It proactively initiates cooperation and sustains it as long as the group demonstrates a sufficient commitment to the public good. The strategy is designed to be adaptive, robust to varied opponent behaviors, and aligned with maximizing overall collective welfare across the game's duration.

**Game Parameters Utilized:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier for total contributions (1 < k < n)

---

**Decision Rules for Player i in Round t:**

1.  **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** To signal a willingness to cooperate and to test the initial inclination of other players. This proactive step is essential for establishing a foundation for potential collective action and high collective welfare from the outset.

2.  **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, the "shadow of the future" disappears. There are no subsequent rounds to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. Defecting is the individually rational choice in this specific scenario and prevents exploitation by other players who are also likely to defect to maximize their final round payoff. This is a robust measure in finitely repeated games to avoid being a "sucker."

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   **Information Gathering:** Before making a decision, observe the actions of all players in the immediately preceding round (round t-1). Calculate `TotalContributions_prev`, which is the sum of contributions from all `n` players in round `t-1`. (i.e., `TotalContributions_prev = sum_j c_j_prev`, where `c_j_prev` is player j's action in round t-1).
    *   **Conditional Contribution Rule:**
        *   **If `TotalContributions_prev >= k`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If the total contributions in the previous round met or exceeded the multiplier `k`, it indicates a sufficient level of collective effort. The `k` parameter, representing the social return on contributions, is used as a dynamic threshold:
                *   When `k` is low (e.g., close to 1), the social returns of the public good are less significant, and therefore the strategy requires a lower minimum number of cooperators to justify its own continued contribution. This makes it more forgiving and enables cooperation even when collective buy-in is naturally lower.
                *   When `k` is high (e.g., close to `n`), the social returns are very significant, and the strategy demands a higher level of collective participation to sustain cooperation.
            *   This approach ensures continued cooperation when the group demonstrates enough commitment to make the public good collectively worthwhile.
        *   **Else (`TotalContributions_prev < k`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If the total contributions in the previous round fell below the `k` threshold, it signals insufficient collective effort or a decline in cooperation. By defecting, the strategy withdraws its contribution, effectively punishing free-riders and signaling disappointment. This aims to incentivize other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds, thereby restoring the conditions for renewed collective cooperation.

---

**Collective Alignment and Robustness:**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** The strategy's initial cooperative move sets a positive tone, actively seeking to establish a high-welfare cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Adaptive and Forgiving Reciprocity:** ACC is adaptive to the observed collective behavior and is forgiving. It will immediately return to cooperation as soon as the `TotalContributions_prev >= k` condition is met, allowing for dynamic recovery from periods of partial or widespread defection.
*   **Robust to Exploitation:** By conditioning its cooperation on a minimum collective contribution, ACC prevents persistent exploitation by purely selfish or less cooperative players. It avoids being a "sucker" by ceasing contributions when the group effort falls short. The last-round defection further protects against end-game exploitation.
*   **Parameter-Tunned Logic:** The dynamic threshold based on `k` allows the strategy to adjust its expectations for collective participation based on the intrinsic efficiency and social returns of the public good, making it robust across a wide range of game parameter settings. This fosters a collective mindset that is both aspirational and pragmatic.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_63 = '''
This strategy, named "Collective Adaptive Reciprocity," aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by initiating with a cooperative stance and then dynamically adjusting its contribution based on the overall level of cooperation observed within the group in the previous round.

### Collective Adaptive Reciprocity Strategy

This strategy is designed to balance the pursuit of the collective optimum with the need for robustness against various opponent behaviors in a repeated Public Goods Game tournament.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r_current`: The current round number (from 1 to `R`).
*   `R`: The total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: The multiplier for the public good (1 < `k` < `n`).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Initial Stance (Round `r_current` = 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy begins by making a full contribution to the public good. This signals a proactive willingness to cooperate and attempts to establish an initial cooperative equilibrium within the group. It aligns with the collective mindset by initiating beneficial action.

2.  **Adaptive Reciprocity (Rounds 1 < `r_current` < `R`):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of each intermediate round, the strategy will observe the actions of all players from the immediately preceding round (`r_current` - 1). It then calculates `Cooperators_in_Previous_Round`, which is the total count of players who contributed (C) in that round.
    *   **Decision Threshold:**
        *   **If `Cooperators_in_Previous_Round >= k`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If the observed collective contribution meets or exceeds `k` (the multiplier for the public good), it indicates a sufficient level of collective engagement and commitment. The strategy reciprocates this effort by continuing to contribute, aiming to sustain the mutually beneficial cooperative state and encourage further cooperation. The threshold `k` is chosen because it represents the minimum number of cooperators needed for the sum of individual benefits from contributions to exceed the total cost of those contributions for the entire group.
        *   **Else (`Cooperators_in_Previous_Round < k`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If the collective contribution falls below the threshold `k`, it signals a lack of sufficient collective effort or the presence of excessive free-riding. To protect its own endowment from exploitation and to signal dissatisfaction with the low level of cooperation, the strategy will defect. This acts as a collective "punishment" mechanism, intended to encourage other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds by demonstrating that non-cooperation will be met with a similar response.

3.  **Endgame Stance (Round `r_current` = `R`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of the game, there are no subsequent rounds for future interactions, reciprocity, or reputation building. The individual incentive to defect becomes the dominant strategy due to the absence of future rewards for cooperation or punishments for defection (backward induction). This is a self-protective measure taken in anticipation of an inevitable breakdown of cooperation in the very last round.

This strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Reciprocator," is designed to foster and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game by combining an initial show of trust, adaptive reciprocity based on group behavior, and a pragmatic endgame. It explicitly considers game parameters (n, k, r) and historical actions to make its decisions.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocator**

**Core Principles:**
*   **Initial Trust:** Begin by cooperating to signal willingness and explore the group's intent.
*   **Adaptive Reciprocity:** React to the collective behavior of other players, adjusting tolerance for defection based on the inherent difficulty of cooperation (as determined by `k` and `n`).
*   **Self-Preservation in Endgame:** Prevent exploitation in the final rounds when future reciprocity is no longer possible.

---

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1: Initial Collective Gesture**
    *   **Action:** Always Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This establishes a cooperative stance from the outset, giving all players an opportunity to reciprocate and begin building a history of collaboration.

*   **Rounds 2 to (r-1): Adaptive Reciprocity Phase**
    *   **Information Used:** In the previous round (round `current_round - 1`), observe `num_others_contributed_prev`, which is the total number of players *other than yourself* who chose to Contribute (C).
    *   **Calculate Cooperation Threshold:** Determine the minimum number of other players that must have contributed for this strategy to continue cooperating. This threshold is calculated as:
        `threshold_for_others = max(1, floor((n - 1) * (1 - k/n)))`
        *   **Explanation of `threshold_for_others`:**
            *   The term `(1 - k/n)` represents the "free-rider incentive factor." A higher `(1 - k/n)` (meaning `k/n` is low) indicates a stronger individual incentive to defect, making cooperation harder to sustain.
            *   Conversely, a lower `(1 - k/n)` (meaning `k/n` is high) indicates a weaker free-rider incentive, making cooperation easier.
            *   By multiplying this factor by `(n-1)` (the number of other players) and taking the `floor`, the threshold adaptively becomes stricter when cooperation is inherently harder (demanding more cooperators) and more lenient when cooperation is easier (requiring fewer cooperators from others).
            *   `max(1, ...)` ensures that at least one other player must have contributed for this strategy to continue cooperating, preventing unconditional cooperation against total defection in smaller groups.
    *   **Action:**
        *   If `num_others_contributed_prev >= threshold_for_others`, then Contribute (C).
        *   Otherwise (if `num_others_contributed_prev < threshold_for_others`), then Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** This rule ensures that the strategy contributes only if the collective effort from others in the previous round met an acceptable standard. It punishes widespread defection by withholding its own contribution, thereby reducing the collective pool further and signaling dissatisfaction. It is designed to be robust against varying levels of temptation to free-ride across different game parameter settings.

*   **Round r: Endgame Protection**
    *   **Action:** Always Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future rounds for reciprocal actions or punishment, meaning the incentive to free-ride becomes overwhelmingly dominant for any rational player. By defecting, this strategy prevents itself from being exploited by opponents who will inevitably defect.

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **Single-Round Game (r=1):** The strategy defaults to "Round 1: Always Contribute (C)". While this is not individually optimal for a pure single-shot game, it adheres to the collective mindset's initial attempt to foster cooperation, as required by the "collective strategy" directive. For repeated games (implied by the task), `r > 1` is usually the case.
*   **Very Few Rounds (e.g., r=2):** The strategy will play C in Round 1 and D in Round 2. This is a common and robust behavior for very short repeated games where opportunities for sustained reciprocity are limited.
*   **Small `n` (e.g., n=2):** The `threshold_for_others` calculation adapts effectively. For `n=2`, `(n-1)` is 1.
    *   If `k/n` is high (e.g., k=1.9, n=2, so `k/n = 0.95`), `threshold_for_others = max(1, floor(1 * (1 - 0.95))) = max(1, floor(0.05)) = 1`. This means if the other player cooperated, I cooperate (Tit-for-Tat).
    *   If `k/n` is low (e.g., k=1.1, n=2, so `k/n = 0.55`), `threshold_for_others = max(1, floor(1 * (1 - 0.55))) = max(1, floor(0.45)) = 1`. This also means Tit-for-Tat for n=2. The `max(1, ...)` ensures it's not too forgiving.

---

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:
*   **Proactively attempting cooperation:** Starting with C in Round 1 initiates the potential for mutual benefit.
*   **Rewarding group cooperation:** Continuing to contribute when `num_others_contributed_prev` meets the adaptive threshold directly reinforces collective action.
*   **Punishing insufficient cooperation:** Defecting when the group's cooperation falls below the threshold serves as a decentralized punishment mechanism, making free-riding less profitable over time and incentivizing others to contribute more.
*   **Adapting to collective difficulty:** The `(1 - k/n)` factor ensures the strategy's demands for collective effort are realistic, being stricter when cooperation is inherently harder (low `k/n`) and more forgiving when it's easier (high `k/n`). This pragmatic approach maximizes the chances of sustainable collective welfare.
*   **Defensive endgame:** While individually rational, the endgame defection is also a collective defense mechanism. If all players understand this rational behavior, it prevents any single player from unfairly benefiting by exploiting others in the final stage, thus preserving the strategy's long-term effectiveness in encouraging cooperation in earlier rounds.

description_COLLECTIVE_65 = '''
This strategy aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game while remaining robust to exploitation. It is designed to be adaptive to the observed behavior of other players, promoting collective welfare by reciprocating cooperative behavior and deterring free-riding.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Conditional Cooperator

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Gesture):**
    *   Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution signals a willingness to cooperate and provides an opportunity for collective cooperation to emerge from the outset.

2.  **Rounds 2 to r-1 (Adaptive Response Phase):**
    *   At the beginning of each of these rounds (from the second round up to, but not including, the last round), observe the actions taken by all players in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   Calculate the **proportion of cooperators** in round `t-1`. Let `m_{t-1}` be the number of players who contributed (chose C) in round `t-1`, and `n` be the total number of players. The proportion is `p_{t-1} = m_{t-1} / n`.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `p_{t-1} >= 0.5` (i.e., at least half of the players contributed in the previous round), then **Contribute (C)**.
        *   Otherwise (`p_{t-1} < 0.5`), then **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This rule promotes sustained cooperation by reciprocating when a substantial portion of the group contributes. It also protects against widespread exploitation by defecting when the level of cooperation falls below a reasonable threshold, thereby "punishing" free-riders and encouraging a return to cooperation in future rounds if other players are also adaptive.

3.  **Round r (Final Round):**
    *   Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round of a finite game with a known end, there are no future interactions or consequences for current actions. The individually rational and dominant strategy is to defect to maximize immediate personal payoff, as contributing would only result in a loss without the possibility of future reciprocation.

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**
This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by actively attempting to initiate and maintain high levels of cooperation, which leads to the best collective outcomes (as `k > 1`). It acknowledges the inherent tension between individual and collective incentives by adaptively responding to the group's behavior, balancing the pursuit of collective welfare with the need for self-preservation in a competitive environment. By rewarding observed cooperation and withholding contributions from persistent free-riders, it aims to foster conditions under which overall group payoffs can be maximized over the course of the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_66 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Trust (ACT)**, is designed to foster and maintain cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It initiates with a trusting contribution, then adapts its behavior based on the observed collective effort, aiming to balance individual prudence with the collective goal of high contributions. It accounts for the "end game" effect in the final round.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Trust (ACT)

**Description:**
The Adaptive Collective Trust (ACT) strategy operates on the principle of conditional cooperation. It starts by extending trust to the group, contributing in the first round to signal a willingness to cooperate. In subsequent rounds, it evaluates the collective contribution from the previous round against a clear majority threshold. If a sufficient number of players contributed, ACT continues to contribute, rewarding the collective effort. If contributions fall below this threshold, ACT temporarily defects to signal dissatisfaction and incentivize renewed collective effort. In the final round, recognizing the absence of future interactions, ACT prioritizes individual self-interest, as is rational in a finite game.

**Decision Rules (for player i):**

1.  **Round 1 (Initiation of Trust):**
    *   **Contribute (C).**
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution signals a willingness to cooperate and attempts to establish a positive, high-contribution equilibrium from the outset. It acts as an investment in potential future cooperation.

2.  **Rounds 2 to r-1 (Adaptive Reciprocity Phase):**
    *   Observe `S_prev`, the total number of contributions from all players (including player i's own contribution) in the previous round (t-1).
    *   Calculate the required threshold for sustained cooperation: `CooperationThreshold = floor(n / 2) + 1`. This threshold represents requiring a strict majority of players to have contributed in the previous round to maintain player i's cooperation.
    *   **If `S_prev` (total contributions in round t-1) is greater than or equal to `CooperationThreshold`:**
        *   **Contribute (C).**
        *   *Rationale:* This choice rewards sufficient collective effort, indicating that the group is maintaining an acceptable level of contribution. By contributing, ACT reinforces the cooperative behavior and encourages its continuation.
    *   **Else (`S_prev` is less than `CooperationThreshold`):**
        *   **Defect (D).**
        *   *Rationale:* This action serves as a collective "punishment" or a signal of dissatisfaction when group effort falls significantly short. By defecting, ACT aims to reduce the benefits for free-riders and incentivize higher contributions in subsequent rounds, demonstrating that cooperation is conditional on collective participation.

3.  **Round r (Final Round - End Game Effect):**
    *   **Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the absolute final round, there are no future interactions for which to build reputation or influence. The standard economic rationality of the one-shot Public Goods Game applies: the dominant strategy for an individual is to defect, as there are no subsequent rounds to reward cooperation or punish defection. This prevents being exploited in the final opportunity.

Strategy Name: Adaptive Conditional Contributor

Overview:
This strategy aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It operates on the principle of conditional cooperation, contributing to the public good as long as a sufficient proportion of other players have demonstrated a commitment to cooperation in the previous round. It is designed to initiate cooperation, react adaptively to group behavior, and protect itself against exploitation, especially in the final stages of the game. The strategy relies solely on observable game parameters and the history of actions and payoffs.

Parameters:
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for total contributions (where `1 < k < n`).

Decision Rules:

1.  **First Round (Current Round = 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** To signal a clear willingness to cooperate and to attempt to establish a collective cooperative equilibrium from the very beginning of the game.

2.  **Last Round (Current Round = r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finitely repeated game, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. Backward induction dictates that defecting is the individually rational dominant strategy, as it maximizes immediate payoff without any future consequences. This prevents exploitation by other players who would inevitably defect in the final round.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (Current Round > 1 and Current Round < r):**
    *   Let `C_prev_round` be the total number of players who chose to Contribute (C) in the immediately preceding round (`current_round - 1`).
    *   **Cooperation Threshold (`T`):** The strategy defines a threshold `T` for collective cooperation. This threshold represents the minimum number of contributors required in the previous round for this strategy to continue contributing.
        *   `T = ceil(n / 2)`
        *   (This means `T` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to half the number of players. For example, if `n=4`, `T=2`; if `n=5`, `T=3`.)
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `C_prev_round >= T`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If the observed level of cooperation in the previous round meets or exceeds the defined threshold, this strategy reciprocates by contributing. This acts to sustain the collective effort, reinforces cooperative behavior among the group, and works towards maximizing overall collective welfare.
        *   Else (`C_prev_round < T`):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If cooperation falls below the established threshold, this strategy switches to defecting. This serves two purposes: first, it protects against exploitation by free-riders when collective effort is insufficient; second, it acts as a signal to the group that more cooperation is needed to restore the public good, potentially prompting other conditional cooperators to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds.

**Summary of Logic:**
The Adaptive Conditional Contributor strategy initiates cooperation, then continuously monitors the group's collective contribution. It maintains its cooperative stance as long as a significant portion of the group (defined by the `ceil(n/2)` threshold) also contributes. If cooperation from the group falters below this critical level, the strategy temporarily defects to protect itself and signal a need for greater collective effort. In the final round, it always defects to align with individual rationality in an endgame scenario. This approach balances the pursuit of collective welfare with a robust, adaptive, and self-protective mechanism.

description_COLLECTIVE_68 = '''
The following strategy, named **"Adaptive Conditional Contributor (ACC)"**, aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It operates under the principle of "start cooperative, respond reciprocally, and ensure self-protection in the endgame," aligning with the goal of maximizing collective welfare while being robust to diverse opponent behaviors.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Conditional Contributor (ACC)

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for total contributions.
*   `Threshold_C`: A dynamic threshold determining the minimum proportion of *other* players who must have contributed in the previous round for this player to contribute.
    *   **If `n = 2`:** `Threshold_C = 0.5`. (This effectively implements a Tit-for-Tat logic for a two-player scenario).
    *   **If `n > 2`:** `Threshold_C = (n - 2) / (n - 1)`. (This allows for at most one defector among the `n-1` other players. If two or more other players defect, the threshold is not met.)

---

**Decision Rules:**

The decision to Contribute (C) or Defect (D) is made sequentially based on the current round number:

1.  **Last Round (current_round = r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite game, there are no future consequences for defection. Backward induction dictates that all rational players will defect, as contributing would only lead to being exploited. This rule takes precedence over all other rules if the current round is the last round.

2.  **First Round (current_round = 1, and r > 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This establishes an initial willingness to cooperate and attempts to signal a cooperative intent to other players, providing an opportunity to build a high-cooperation equilibrium which benefits everyone (since `k > 1`).

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < current_round < r):**
    *   **Observation:** Review the actions of all `n-1` *other* players in the immediately preceding round (`current_round - 1`).
    *   **Calculation:** Determine the **Other-Cooperation Rate (OCR)** for the previous round:
        `OCR = (Number of other players who Contributed in previous round) / (n - 1)`
        *(Note: This calculation explicitly excludes this player's own action from the previous round.)*
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **IF `OCR >= Threshold_C`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** A sufficient number of other players demonstrated cooperation in the last round. Continuing to contribute reinforces cooperative behavior and works towards achieving the collectively optimal outcome.
        *   **ELSE (`OCR < Threshold_C`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** The level of cooperation from other players was insufficient (too many free-riders). This acts as a reciprocal punishment, signaling that cooperation is conditional and deterring future widespread defection.

---

**Alignment with Collective Mindset and Robustness:**

*   **Promotes Collective Welfare:** By initiating cooperation and maintaining it under reasonable conditions, the ACC strategy aims to establish and sustain the highest possible collective payoff (where all players receive `k` per round).
*   **Adaptive and Forgiving:** The strategy is not a "Grim Trigger" (which defects permanently after a single defection). Instead, it adapts to the current state of cooperation. If players who previously defected begin to cooperate again, pushing the `OCR` above `Threshold_C`, the ACC strategy will resume contributing, allowing for the re-establishment of cooperation.
*   **Robust to Defection:** The `Threshold_C` ensures that the strategy is not overly exploitable. If a critical mass of players free-ride, the strategy will switch to defection, protecting its own payoff and signaling that free-riding will not be tolerated indefinitely.
*   **Handles Endgame Rationality:** By defecting in the last round, the strategy avoids being exploited by others who will rationally defect given no future consequences.
*   **Parameter Sensitivity:** The `Threshold_C` is dynamically set based on `n` to provide a sensible level of forgiveness across different group sizes. For `n=2`, it mirrors Tit-for-Tat, a known robust strategy. For `n>2`, it tolerates a single free-rider among others, balancing forgiveness with the need to prevent widespread exploitation.

description_COLLECTIVE_69 = '''
The following strategy, "Adaptive Majority Cooperator" (AMC), is designed for the repeated Public Goods Game to foster collective welfare through conditional cooperation, while remaining robust to diverse opponent behaviors and individual incentives.

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Majority Cooperator (AMC)

**Overview:**
The Adaptive Majority Cooperator (AMC) strategy aims to maximize collective payoff by promoting and sustaining cooperation within the group. It begins by signaling a willingness to contribute and then adaptively responds to the observed level of collective contribution in previous rounds. The strategy rewards sufficient group cooperation by continuing to contribute, and it withdraws contributions when collective effort falters, thereby protecting its own endowment and signaling the necessity of broader participation. It also accounts for the game's finite horizon.

**Decision Rules:**

**1. Initial Round (Round 1):**
*   **Action:** Contribute (C)
*   **Rationale:** The strategy initiates cooperation by contributing its token. This serves as an open signal of willingness to engage in the collective endeavor, providing the group with the best initial opportunity to establish a positive feedback loop for mutual benefit.

**2. Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
*   **Information Used:** In each intermediate round `t`, the strategy observes the total number of contributions (`total_contributions^(t-1)`) made by all `n` players (including itself) in the immediate preceding round `t-1`.
*   **Decision Logic:**
    *   **If `total_contributions^(t-1)` is greater than or equal to the `Cooperation_Threshold`:**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
        *   **Rationale:** When a sufficient number of players demonstrated commitment to the public good in the prior round, this strategy reciprocates by contributing. This reinforces the collective effort and encourages continued cooperation, which is essential for achieving higher group payoffs (`k > 1`).
    *   **Else (`total_contributions^(t-1)` is less than the `Cooperation_Threshold`):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D)
        *   **Rationale:** If the observed collective contribution falls below the required threshold, this strategy defects. This action serves as a protective measure against exploitation, preventing the individual from bearing an undue cost when the group as a whole is not adequately supporting the public good. It also acts as a signal that cooperation is conditional on a shared, robust effort.

**3. Final Round (Round r):**
*   **Action:** Defect (D)
*   **Rationale:** In the very last round of the game, there are no future interactions to influence. Based on game-theoretic principles (backward induction), any contribution made in this round cannot be reciprocated or impact future behavior. Therefore, to prevent being exploited by other players who will rationally defect, this strategy defects to maximize its own immediate payoff.

**Edge Cases & Strategy Parameters:**

*   **`Cooperation_Threshold`:** This strategy uses a fixed, robust threshold to determine sufficient collective effort.
    *   The `Cooperation_Threshold` is calculated as `floor(n / 2) + 1`.
    *   This means that strictly more than half of the players in the game must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to contribute in the current round. This ensures that a clear majority, rather than just a simple half, is actively participating, signifying a strong collective commitment.
    *   *Example:* If there are `n=4` players, the threshold is `floor(4/2) + 1 = 3`. So, at least 3 players must contribute.
    *   *Example:* If there are `n=5` players, the threshold is `floor(5/2) + 1 = 3`. So, at least 3 players must contribute.

**Collective Alignment:**
This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:
1.  **Leading by Example:** Initiating cooperation to establish a path towards the socially optimal outcome.
2.  **Rewarding and Sustaining Effort:** Contributing when a significant portion of the group cooperates, thereby fostering and maintaining high collective contributions.
3.  **Protecting and Correcting:** Defecting when collective effort is insufficient, which discourages widespread defection and protects the individual while signaling the need for stronger group participation to restore cooperation.
4.  **Pragmatic Rationality:** Recognizing the structural incentives of the final round to prevent exploitation, which indirectly protects the cumulative gains achieved in earlier rounds.

The AMC strategy is adaptive as it responds directly to observed history, and robust as it does not rely on assumptions about other players' strategies beyond their observable actions. It seeks to establish and maintain a high level of cooperation without requiring explicit communication or shared norms.

STRATEGY: Adaptive Collective Cooperator (ACC)

The Adaptive Collective Cooperator (ACC) strategy is designed to promote and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game by initiating with a cooperative stance and maintaining it as long as a sufficient collective effort is observed. It dynamically adjusts its willingness to contribute based on the inherent cooperativeness of the game (parameters `n` and `k`) and the past actions of all players, while preventing exploitation.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Initial Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   Rationale: The strategy begins by demonstrating a willingness to cooperate, aiming to establish a cooperative norm from the outset. This aligns with a collective mindset by taking the first step towards maximizing overall welfare.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   **Observation:** At the end of the previous round, the strategy observes the total number of players who contributed. Let this be `N_coop_prev = sum_j c_j_prev`.
    *   **Threshold Calculation:** A dynamic cooperation threshold, `T`, is calculated based on the game parameters:
        *   `T = ceil(n / k)`
        *   *Rationale for `T`*: This threshold represents the minimum number of cooperators required for the public good to generate sufficient value to, on average, cover the individual cost of contribution across all players. If `N_coop_prev` falls below `T`, the collective effort is deemed insufficient to justify continued individual contribution from a long-term sustainability perspective. This threshold naturally adapts:
            *   If `k` is small (close to 1), `n/k` is large (close to `n`), resulting in a high `T`. This means a large number of cooperators are needed to sustain the public good when the multiplier is low, reflecting the inherent difficulty of cooperation in such scenarios.
            *   If `k` is large (close to `n`), `n/k` is small (close to 1), resulting in a low `T`. This indicates that fewer cooperators are needed when the multiplier is high, as the public good generates substantial value more readily.
    *   **Action Rule:**
        *   If `N_coop_prev >= T`: **Contribute (C)**
        *   Else (if `N_coop_prev < T`): **Defect (D)**
    *   Rationale: This rule ensures that the strategy contributes when there is sufficient collective buy-in, promoting sustained cooperation. If the collective effort wanes below a meaningful, game-dependent threshold, the strategy defects to prevent continuous exploitation, signaling that a robust collective good requires broad collective contribution.

*   **Final Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   Rationale: In the final round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. Contributing would be an unreciprocated sacrifice. Defecting is a rational and robust choice in repeated games with a known finite horizon, preventing exploitation in this end-game scenario.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by initiating with a contribution.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by defecting.
*   **Single-Player Defection:** If only one or a few players defect, but `N_coop_prev` still meets or exceeds the `T` threshold, the strategy continues to contribute, demonstrating forgiveness and an effort to maintain overall cooperation.
*   **Mass Defection:** If a significant number of players defect, causing `N_coop_prev` to fall below `T`, the strategy will respond by defecting, preventing continuous exploitation and adapting to a non-cooperative environment.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** The strategy's initial contribution proactively fosters a cooperative environment, aiming for the collective optimum.
*   **Sustainable Conditional Cooperation:** By using the `ceil(n / k)` threshold, the strategy ensures that it contributes only when the collective effort is generating enough value to broadly justify the individual investment. This prevents the strategy from being a "sucker" and maintains the long-term viability of the collective good. It seeks cooperation that is beneficial for the group as a whole.
*   **Adaptive and Robust:** The strategy adapts to the collective behavior of others, encouraging cooperation when feasible but robustly protecting against sustained exploitation. The defection in the last round, while individually rational, is a necessary measure to ensure robustness, which, if adopted by a critical mass, prevents overall exploitation.

This strategy, named "Adaptive Group Reciprocity (AGR)," is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game while remaining robust against exploitation. It achieves this by initiating cooperation, conditionally maintaining it based on the observed behavior of the group, and protecting itself in the end game.

The strategy operates based on the game parameters: `n` (number of players), `r` (total rounds), and `k` (multiplier, where 1 < k < n).

---

**Adaptive Group Reciprocity (AGR) Strategy Description:**

This strategy evaluates the collective behavior of other players and adapts its contribution decisions accordingly, aiming to support cooperation when viable and protect itself otherwise.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy always starts by contributing in the first round. This serves as an initial signal of willingness to cooperate and gives all other players an opportunity to observe a cooperative action, which is crucial for establishing a cooperative equilibrium.

*   **Rounds 2 to r-1 (Adaptive Play):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t` (where `1 < t < r`), the strategy observes the actions of all `n-1` other players from the preceding round `t-1`.
    *   **Calculate Group Contribution Score (GCS):**
        *   Let `C_other_t-1` be the count of other players (excluding self) who contributed (C) in round `t-1`.
        *   The GCS is calculated as the proportion of other players who contributed: `GCS = C_other_t-1 / (n - 1)`.
    *   **Decision Threshold (T):** The strategy uses a dynamically derived threshold `T = k / n`. This threshold represents the individual share of the total public good. If the average contribution from other players falls below this proportion, it signals that the collective good is not being sufficiently supported.
    *   **Action:**
        *   If `GCS >= T`: Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If the observed level of cooperation from the group meets or exceeds the threshold, the strategy continues to contribute. This reinforces cooperative behavior and aims to sustain the collective benefit.
        *   Else (`GCS < T`): Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If the group's cooperation level falls below the critical threshold, the strategy switches to defection. This protects against exploitation by free-riders and signals to the group that a higher level of cooperation is required to maintain the strategy's contribution.

**2. Handle Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (Round 1):** Addressed above – always Contribute (C).
*   **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of the game, there are no future interactions that could incentivize cooperation. From a game-theoretic perspective, the rational action for all players is to defect. This prevents the strategy from being exploited by any opponent playing rationally in the end game.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

The AGR strategy embodies a collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** It always begins by contributing, offering an opportunity for the group to establish a cooperative pattern.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** It is willing to contribute when others contribute, thereby supporting mutual benefit. This helps sustain a higher collective payoff than would occur if all players consistently defected.
*   **Parameterized Threshold:** The use of `k/n` as a threshold directly links the strategy's decision to the fundamental parameters of the public goods problem, ensuring that the collective contribution is only maintained when there is a sufficient return from the group.
*   **Self-Protection:** While fostering cooperation, it avoids naive altruism. By defecting when cooperation levels are too low, it prevents being a "sucker" and discourages persistent free-riding, which ultimately contributes to a more stable, albeit potentially lower, collective outcome than would occur if one player was continuously exploited.

This strategy is adaptive, responding to the observed behavior of the group, and robust, as it can defend against purely self-interested strategies while still being able to foster and participate in cooperative outcomes with other adaptive strategies.

The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity," is designed to foster and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game while remaining robust to various opponent behaviors in a tournament setting. It aligns with a collective mindset by actively seeking and rewarding group contributions, but protects itself against exploitation through conditional responses and strategic end-game play.

---

### Adaptive Collective Reciprocity Strategy

This strategy operates in three distinct phases: an initial phase to establish cooperation, an adaptive core phase to maintain it, and a final phase to account for end-game effects.

**1. Decision Rules (When to Cooperate vs. Defect):**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Play):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   **Rationale:** To initiate cooperation and signal a willingness to contribute to the collective good. This provides the best opportunity for the group to achieve high collective payoffs from the outset.

*   **Rounds 2 to (r-1) (Adaptive Core Play):**
    *   **Information Used:** The actions of all players in the immediately preceding round (Round `t-1`).
    *   **Calculation:**
        1.  **Proportion of Cooperators in Previous Round (P_c_prev):**
            *   `P_c_prev = (Number of players who contributed in Round t-1) / n`
        2.  **Dynamic Cooperation Threshold (T_coop):**
            *   `T_coop = 1 - (1 / k)`
            *   **Rationale for T_coop:** This threshold dynamically adjusts based on the game's collective benefit multiplier `k`.
                *   When `k` is high (meaning contributions yield significant collective gains for the group), `T_coop` will also be high (approaching 1). This implies a stricter expectation: if the collective benefit is large, the strategy demands a higher proportion of cooperators to continue contributing. This discourages significant free-riding when the stakes are high.
                *   When `k` is lower (closer to 1), `T_coop` will be lower (e.g., `k=2` yields `T_coop=0.5`). This implies a more lenient expectation: if the collective benefit is weaker, the strategy is more forgiving of some free-riders to try and sustain *any* level of cooperation rather than allowing it to completely break down.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `P_c_prev >= T_coop`: **Contribute (C).** This reinforces cooperative behavior observed in the group and aims to sustain high collective payoffs.
        *   Else (`P_c_prev < T_coop`): **Defect (D).** This acts as a collective punishment mechanism. If the observed cooperation falls below the dynamically set expectation, the strategy defects to protect itself from being exploited and to signal that current cooperation levels are unacceptable.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **Round 1:** Addressed above – Always Contribute (C).

*   **Round r (Final Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future rounds for retaliation or reward. The individually rational action for any player is to defect (free-ride), as there are no consequences for doing so. To prevent exploitation by other perfectly rational or opportunistic strategies in a tournament setting, this strategy will also defect in the last round. While this deviates from the direct collective goal for that specific round, it is a crucial robustness measure to protect the strategy's overall performance.

**3. Collective Alignment:**

This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** It starts by contributing, offering all players the chance to achieve the maximum collective benefit.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** It explicitly uses a threshold (`T_coop`) that scales with the collective benefit (`k`), demanding higher levels of cooperation when the public good is more valuable. This encourages sustained high contributions from the group.
*   **Punishing Free-Riding:** By defecting when cooperation levels are too low, it aims to deter opportunistic behavior and steer the group back towards higher collective contributions.
*   **Adaptive Nature:** Its decisions are based on the observed collective behavior of the group, making it responsive to the actual dynamics of cooperation.

While the final round defection is an individualistic choice, it serves as a pragmatic safeguard in a competitive environment, ensuring the strategy's robustness and preventing it from being systematically exploited, which indirectly contributes to its long-term viability in achieving positive outcomes over multiple game instances.

description_COLLECTIVE_73 = '''
This strategy, named **Parameter-Adaptive Reciprocity (PAR)**, aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by initiating trust and then adapting its behavior based on the observed collective contribution levels, using a threshold derived from the game's parameters.

---

**Strategy: Parameter-Adaptive Reciprocity (PAR)**

**1. Decision Rules**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Trust)**:
    *   Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale*: This action signals a willingness to initiate cooperation and build collective welfare from the outset, aiming to encourage a positive starting state for the public good.

*   **Middle Rounds (Round 2 to `r-1`)**:
    *   Observe the actions of all players in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   Let `N_C_prev` be the total number of players who contributed in round `t-1`.
    *   Calculate the **Cooperation Threshold (T_C)**: `T_C = ceil(n / k)`.
        *   *Rationale*: This threshold adapts to the game's parameters `n` (number of players) and `k` (multiplier). It represents the minimum number of total contributions needed in the previous round for an individual contribution to theoretically "pay off" (in terms of the `k/n` share of the public good value) if it were sustained.
            *   If `k` is high (close to `n`), `T_C` will be small (e.g., 2 or 3), making it easier to sustain cooperation.
            *   If `k` is low (close to `1`), `T_C` will be large (potentially up to `n`), requiring a very high level of collective effort to maintain cooperation.
    *   **If `N_C_prev >= T_C`**: Always **Contribute (C)**.
        *   *Rationale*: If the collective effort in the previous round met or exceeded the threshold, it signals sufficient group cooperation. Reciprocating by contributing helps to reward and sustain this collective action.
    *   **Else (`N_C_prev < T_C`)**: Always **Defect (D)**.
        *   *Rationale*: If the collective effort fell below the threshold, it indicates insufficient cooperation. Defecting serves to signal dissatisfaction with the lack of collective contribution and protects against individual exploitation, while attempting to pressure others to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds.

*   **Final Round (`r`)**:
    *   Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale*: In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions for one's current action to influence. Therefore, the individually rational and dominant strategy is to defect to maximize personal payoff, as per standard game-theoretic backward induction.

**2. Handle Edge Cases**

*   **First Round**: Explicitly handled by the "Round 1" rule (always Contribute).
*   **Last Round**: Explicitly handled by the "Final Round (`r`)" rule (always Defect).
*   The `T_C = ceil(n / k)` threshold dynamically adjusts to the specific `n` and `k` values of the game, providing robustness across different game configurations (where `1 < k < n`).

**3. Collective Alignment**

*   **Initiation**: The strategy starts with a cooperative move in Round 1 to establish a foundation for collective welfare, demonstrating a willingness to contribute to the public good.
*   **Sustained Cooperation**: By contributing when `N_C_prev >= T_C`, the strategy actively supports and rewards collective action. The threshold `T_C` itself is derived from the game's efficiency (`k/n`), promoting collective contribution when the public good mechanism is sufficiently robust to make cooperation worthwhile for the group.
*   **Deterrence of Free-Riding**: By defecting when `N_C_prev < T_C`, the strategy signals that free-riding is not tolerated beyond a certain point. This acts as a collective punishment mechanism, discouraging insufficient contributions and protecting individuals from being exploited, thereby promoting long-term collective welfare by incentivizing a critical mass of cooperation.
*   **Practicality in Tournament Settings**: While the last-round defection is individually rational rather than purely "collective," it is a necessary self-protective measure in a tournament where other strategies may exploit any perceived "altruism" in the final round, thus ensuring robustness.

Strategy Name: Adaptive Consensus Builder

Overview:
This strategy aims to foster and sustain high levels of cooperation to maximize collective welfare in the Public Goods Game, while remaining robust against exploitation. It operates on the principle of conditional cooperation, signaling willingness to contribute but swiftly reacting to widespread defection, and recognizing the unavoidable end-game dynamics.

Decision Rules:

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   *Rationale:* This strategy begins by contributing its token. This serves as an initial signal of its willingness to cooperate and invest in the public good, providing an opportunity for all players to establish a positive cooperative equilibrium from the start. It is a necessary first step towards achieving collective benefit.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 through Round r-1):**
    *   **Identify Group Cooperation:** At the start of each of these rounds, the strategy observes the number of players who contributed in the *immediately preceding round*. Let this be `C_prev`.
    *   **Define Cooperation Threshold:** The strategy calculates a dynamic threshold, `T_coop = ceil(n / 2)`. This represents a simple majority of players.
    *   **Conditional Action:**
        *   If `C_prev >= T_coop`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   *Rationale:* If a majority (or more) of players contributed in the previous round, it indicates a strong collective effort and a shared commitment to the public good. This strategy reciprocates and reinforces this positive behavior by contributing, thereby supporting the collective good and rewarding widespread cooperation.
        *   If `C_prev < T_coop`:
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* If less than a majority of players contributed in the previous round, it signals a significant breakdown in collective effort or a high degree of free-riding. In this scenario, continuing to contribute would make this strategy vulnerable to exploitation by non-cooperators. Therefore, it defects to protect its own payoff and to signal that widespread defection is not sustainable or profitable for the group. This acts as a collective "punishment" or a mechanism to disincentivize continued free-riding, aiming to encourage a return to cooperative behavior in future rounds.

3.  **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round of the game, the prospect of future interactions for reciprocity or reputation building no longer exists. Game theory dictates that the individually rational, dominant strategy in a one-shot Public Goods Game is to defect, as there are no future consequences for free-riding. To prevent exploitation by other players who will likely also defect (knowing it's the last round), and to protect its own final payoff, this strategy defects. This is a pragmatic necessity in a finite game.

Alignment with Collective Mindset:
This strategy is designed with a collective mindset, aiming to achieve and sustain the collective optimum (universal contribution resulting in a payoff of `k` for all, which is greater than 1). It initiates cooperation and strives to maintain it when a critical mass of players demonstrate a commitment to the public good. It acknowledges the inherent tension between individual incentives and collective welfare. By setting a majority threshold for cooperation, it implicitly assumes that for the collective good to truly flourish, a significant portion of the group must actively participate. Its defection mechanism serves not as purely selfish behavior, but as a robust defense against free-riding that would otherwise erode the collective benefit for everyone and make sustained cooperation impossible. The end-game defection is a necessary pragmatic adaptation to the game's structure, preventing exploitation while still having striven for collective good throughout the majority of the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_75 = '''
This strategy is designed to promote and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game while being robust against exploitation and adaptive to various group behaviors. It embodies a "Reciprocal Collective Contributor" approach, starting cooperatively and adjusting its behavior based on the observed collective contribution of others.

---

**Strategy Name:** Reciprocal Collective Contributor (RCC)

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Cooperative Stance):**
    *   Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This action signals a willingness to cooperate and attempts to establish a cooperative baseline for the group. It allows for observation of initial group behavior without prejudgment.

*   **Rounds 2 to r-1 (Adaptive Reciprocity):**
    *   At the beginning of each round `t` (where `1 < t < r`), observe the actions of all *other* `(n-1)` players in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   Count the number of other players who chose to Defect (D) in round `t-1`. Let this be `N_defectors_others_prev`.

    *   **If `N_defectors_others_prev <= floor((n-1) / 2)`:**
        *   **Contribute (C)**.
        *   *Rationale:* This rule implies that if the number of other players who defected is less than or equal to half of the other players, this strategy contributes. In other words, if a majority (or at least half) of the *other* players contributed, this strategy continues to contribute. This fosters cooperation by rewarding sufficient collective effort and allows for some minor free-riding without immediately collapsing into defection.

    *   **If `N_defectors_others_prev > floor((n-1) / 2)`:**
        *   **Defect (D)**.
        *   *Rationale:* If more than half of the other players defected in the previous round, this strategy defects in response. This acts as a collective punishment mechanism, signaling disapproval of widespread free-riding, preventing excessive exploitation, and encouraging a return to higher contribution levels.

*   **Round r (Final Round Unraveling):**
    *   Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* Due to the finite nature of the game and the absence of future interactions to incentivize cooperation, rational self-interest dictates defection in the final round to maximize immediate payoff. This strategy acknowledges this game-theoretic reality.

**2. Handle Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by initiating with a contribution (C).
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by defecting (D), consistent with backward induction.
*   **Small `n` values:**
    *   For `n=2` (two players), `floor((2-1) / 2) = 0`. The rule becomes: if the *other* player did not defect (i.e., contributed), contribute; otherwise (if the other player defected), defect. This accurately reduces to a classic Tit-for-Tat strategy.
    *   For `n=3` (three players), `floor((3-1) / 2) = 1`. The rule becomes: if at most one other player defected (meaning at least one other player contributed), contribute; otherwise (if both other players defected), defect. This provides a balanced response for a small group.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

*   The strategy actively promotes collective welfare by initiating cooperation and maintaining it as long as a sufficient level of collective contribution is observed.
*   It operates on a principle of collective reciprocity, where its own contribution is contingent on the group's past cooperative behavior rather than individual player actions alone.
*   By tolerating a reasonable amount of free-riding (up to half of the other players), the strategy is designed to be forgiving enough to recover from minor deviations or errors, thereby fostering long-term cooperation and preventing a swift descent into mutual defection (unlike a strict "Grim Trigger" strategy).
*   The overarching goal is to achieve and sustain a high level of overall contributions and, consequently, higher collective payoffs for the group over the course of the tournament.

description_COLLECTIVE_76 = '''
The following strategy, named **Adaptive Public Good Steward**, is designed for the repeated Public Goods Game (PGG). It prioritizes establishing and maintaining collective cooperation while remaining robust against exploitation and adapting to varying game parameters and opponent behaviors.

---

**Adaptive Public Good Steward Strategy Description**

**1. Collective Goal:**
The primary objective of this strategy is to foster and sustain the highest feasible level of collective contribution, thereby maximizing the total welfare generated within the game. It aims to be cooperative, forgiving, and protective against persistent free-riding.

**2. Core Principles:**
This strategy operates on the principles of conditional cooperation, employing a dynamic threshold for collective effort, incorporating a grace period for minor deviations, and applying targeted punishment for sustained non-cooperation. It acknowledges the unique dynamics of the game's final round.

**3. Key Game Parameters Utilized:**
*   `n`: The total number of players in the game.
*   `k`: The multiplier applied to the total contributions, where `1 < k < n`.
*   `r`: The total number of rounds in the game.

**4. Internal State (per strategy instance, updated each round):**
*   **`Consecutive Low Cooperation Rounds Counter`**: This counter tracks how many consecutive rounds the observed collective contribution from all players has fallen below the strategy's defined cooperation threshold. It starts at zero and is reset whenever cooperation is deemed sufficient.

**5. Dynamic Cooperation Threshold Calculation:**
The strategy calculates a dynamic `Cooperation Threshold (T)` based on the game's parameters `n` and `k`. This threshold represents the minimum number of total contributions required in a round for the collective effort to be considered "sufficient" by this strategy.

*   **`Cooperation Threshold (T)` = The largest integer less than or equal to `n * (1 - 1/k)`, but always at least 1.**
    *   *Mathematical Representation*: `T = max(1, floor(n * (1 - 1/k)))`
    *   *Rationale*: This threshold dynamically adjusts to the game's incentive structure. When `k` is low (meaning the public good is less efficient), `T` will be lower, reflecting that even a small number of cooperators is enough to maintain hope for collective action. When `k` is high (meaning the public good is very efficient), `T` will be higher, pushing for a greater collective effort to fully capitalize on the high returns.

**6. Decision Rules (Action Selection for Each Round):**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Play):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   *Rationale*: The strategy begins by contributing its token. This serves as an initial signal of willingness to cooperate and an attempt to jumpstart the collective endeavor, giving all players an opportunity to observe the potential benefits of cooperation.

*   **Rounds 2 through `r-1` (Intermediate Play):**
    *   At the start of each of these rounds, the strategy observes the `Total Contributions` made by all players in the *immediately preceding round*. Let this be `C_previous_round`.

    *   **Condition 1: Sufficient Cooperation Observed**
        *   **If `C_previous_round` is greater than or equal to the `Cooperation Threshold (T)`:**
            *   Reset the `Consecutive Low Cooperation Rounds Counter` to 0.
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   *Rationale*: When the collective contribution meets or exceeds the threshold, it indicates a healthy level of cooperation. The strategy reinforces this by continuing to contribute, sustaining the collective good and incentivizing others to do the same.

    *   **Condition 2: Insufficient Cooperation Observed**
        *   **If `C_previous_round` is less than the `Cooperation Threshold (T)`:**
            *   Increment the `Consecutive Low Cooperation Rounds Counter` by 1.
            *   **If `Consecutive Low Cooperation Rounds Counter` is 1 (Forgiveness Phase):**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
                *   *Rationale*: The strategy offers a single round of "grace" or forgiveness. This is a deliberate design choice to prevent the immediate breakdown of cooperation due to minor fluctuations, occasional mistakes, or to allow for a single "warning shot." It signals a strong preference for re-establishing cooperation.
            *   **If `Consecutive Low Cooperation Rounds Counter` is 2 or more (Punishment Phase):**
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**
                *   *Rationale*: If the collective contribution consistently falls below the threshold for two or more consecutive rounds, it indicates a persistent lack of cooperation or active free-riding by others. To protect itself from continuous exploitation and to re-incentivize cooperation, the strategy switches to defection. This serves as a strong signal that sustained non-cooperation will lead to adverse consequences for all, including free-riders.

*   **Round `r` (Final Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale*: In the very last round of a finite game, the "shadow of the future" disappears. There are no subsequent rounds in which players can be rewarded for cooperation or punished for defection. Under these circumstances, individual rational choice dictates defecting to maximize one's immediate personal payoff, regardless of past game history. This strategy robustly anticipates this universally rational behavior (the "endgame effect") and acts accordingly to avoid being exploited by others who will also rationally defect.

**7. Robustness and Collective Alignment:**
The Adaptive Public Good Steward strategy is designed to be highly adaptive and robust across a wide range of opponent strategies. It is explicitly aligned with a collective mindset by:
*   Proactively initiating cooperation.
*   Dynamically adjusting its expectations for collective contributions based on game parameters (`k` and `n`).
*   Employing a forgiving mechanism to promote resilience and allow for recovery from minor dips in cooperation.
*   Implementing a firm punishment mechanism for persistent free-riding, which serves to enforce collective norms and encourage higher overall contributions in the long term.
*   Recognizing the game-theoretic realities of finite play to ensure its own long-term viability and prevent exploitation in the final round.

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**

**Overview:**
The Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR) strategy is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It operates on a state-based system that prioritizes achieving full collective contribution, responds to deviations from this ideal by initiating punishment, and offers a clear path for forgiveness and the re-establishment of cooperation. The strategy aims to maximize the collective welfare by encouraging mutual contribution while remaining adaptive and robust to varying opponent behaviors.

**State Variables:**
The strategy maintains an internal `Current_State` variable, which can be either `Cooperate` or `Punish`. This variable is initialized to `Cooperate` at the start of the game.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   The `Current_State` is `Cooperate`. This initial action signals a willingness to engage in collective action and establishes a foundation for mutual trust.

2.  **Subsequent Rounds (Round `t` for `1 < t < r`):**
    *   At the beginning of round `t`, the strategy observes the actions of *all* players (including itself) from the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   Let `Num_Contributors_Last_Round` be the total count of players who contributed `1` token in round `t-1`.

    *   **If `Current_State` is `Cooperate`:**
        *   **If `Num_Contributors_Last_Round == n` (meaning all players contributed in the previous round):**
            *   Action: **Contribute (C)**.
            *   Stay in the `Cooperate` state. (This reinforces successful collective cooperation and maintains the optimal outcome).
        *   **If `Num_Contributors_Last_Round < n` (meaning at least one player defected in the previous round):**
            *   Action: **Defect (D)**.
            *   Transition to the `Punish` state. (This responds to any deviation from full collective contribution by initiating a punitive phase to discourage free-riding).

    *   **If `Current_State` is `Punish`:**
        *   **If `Num_Contributors_Last_Round == n` (meaning all players contributed in the previous round, signaling a collective attempt to re-establish cooperation):**
            *   Action: **Contribute (C)**.
            *   Transition back to the `Cooperate` state. (This offers forgiveness and allows for the re-establishment of mutual cooperation once all players signal their commitment).
        *   **If `Num_Contributors_Last_Round < n` (meaning some players are still defecting or full collective cooperation has not yet been restored):**
            *   Action: **Defect (D)**.
            *   Stay in the `Punish` state. (This continues the punitive phase until a clear signal of universal cooperation is observed).

3.  **Last Round (Round `t = r`):**
    *   Regardless of the `Current_State` or previous history, always **Defect (D)**.
    *   In the final round of a finite repeated game, the "shadow of the future" disappears. There are no subsequent rounds for punishment or reward. The incentive structure reverts to that of a single-shot Public Goods Game, where defection is the individually dominant strategy. This decision ensures the strategy's robustness against exploitation in the final round.

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

*   **Prioritizes Collective Welfare:** The strategy's primary goal is to achieve and sustain the state of `n` contributions, which yields the maximum collective payoff (`n*k`).
*   **Initial Trust and Signal:** By always contributing in the first round, the strategy transparently signals its intent to cooperate for the collective good.
*   **Enforces Collective Norms:** It actively discourages free-riding by defecting when any player deviates from full contribution, acting as a distributed enforcement mechanism for collective cooperation.
*   **Path to Reconciliation:** Unlike a permanent "grim trigger," ACR is designed with a clear forgiveness mechanism. It allows the group to recover from breakdowns in cooperation, preventing a perpetual spiral into mutual defection and enabling the re-establishment of the collective optimum.
*   **Adaptive and Robust:** By dynamically reacting to the *collective* behavior observed in the previous round, the strategy is adaptive. The last-round defection, while not ideal from a pure single-round collective perspective, is a critical adaptation for robustness in a finite tournament setting, preventing predictable exploitation and contributing to the overall stability of the strategy.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness (ARF)

**Core Principle:**
The Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness (ARF) strategy aims to establish and maintain a high level of collective contribution in the Public Goods Game. It operates on the principle of conditional cooperation: starting cooperatively, then monitoring the group's contribution levels to decide whether to continue contributing or to temporarily defect as a response to free-riding. This strategy is designed to be robust, adaptive, and promote overall collective welfare while protecting itself from persistent exploitation.

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`: A floating-point value (between 0 and 1, inclusive) that defines the minimum acceptable average contribution from *other* players in the previous round to warrant cooperation from this strategy.
    *   **Recommended Value:** `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD = 0.5`
        *   *Rationale:* This threshold ensures that if at least half of the other players contributed in the previous round, this strategy will cooperate. It strikes a balance between being too lenient (exploitable) and too strict (leading to cycles of defection), promoting collective action while still requiring significant reciprocity.

**Internal State:**
*   `current_stance`: An internal variable that tracks the strategy's current disposition. It can be one of two states: `COOPERATE` or `DEFECT`.
    *   This state dictates the action (contribute 1 or 0 tokens) for the current round.
    *   It is initialized to `COOPERATE` at the very beginning of the game.

**Decision Rules:**

**For each Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Special Case: Last Round (`t == r`)**
    *   **Action:** Contribute 0 tokens (Defect).
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no subsequent interactions to incentivize future cooperation. Based on backward induction, the individually rational choice for all players is to defect to maximize their immediate payoff. This strategy defects to avoid being exploited by others who will also rationally defect.

2.  **Special Case: First Round (`t == 1`)**
    *   **Action:** Contribute 1 token (Cooperate).
    *   *Rationale:* With no prior history of play, this strategy initiates cooperation. This signals a willingness to contribute to the collective good and provides an opportunity to observe other players' initial intentions.
    *   *Internal State Update:* Set `current_stance = COOPERATE`.

3.  **General Case: Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t < r`)**
    *   **Observe Past Actions:** At the beginning of round `t`, review the contributions (`c_j^{t-1}`) of all players from the *previous* round (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculate Average Other Players' Contribution:**
        *   Sum the contributions of all players *except this strategy* in round `t-1`. Let this be `total_contributions_others_last_round`.
        *   Calculate the average: `avg_others_contribution_last_round = total_contributions_others_last_round / (n - 1)`.
    *   **Determine Next Stance:**
        *   **If `avg_others_contribution_last_round >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   *Internal State Update:* Set `current_stance = COOPERATE`.
            *   *Rationale:* A sufficient proportion of other players demonstrated cooperation in the previous round. This indicates a potential for collective action, and this strategy will continue (or resume) cooperating to sustain the public good.
        *   **Else (`avg_others_contribution_last_round < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):**
            *   *Internal State Update:* Set `current_stance = DEFECT`.
            *   *Rationale:* The average contribution from other players has fallen below the acceptable threshold. This strategy will temporarily withhold contributions as a "punishment" or disincentive for free-riding, aiming to encourage others to increase their contributions.
    *   **Action for Current Round `t`:**
        *   If `current_stance` is `COOPERATE`: Contribute 1 token.
        *   If `current_stance` is `DEFECT`: Contribute 0 tokens.

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** The strategy always begins by contributing, offering the group an immediate chance to achieve high collective welfare.
*   **Rewards and Sustains Cooperation:** By continuously contributing when others meet the `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`, it actively supports the public good and fosters a cooperative environment.
*   **Adaptive Punishment for Restoration:** When free-riding is detected, the strategy switches to defection not out of pure self-interest, but as a mechanism to signal dissatisfaction and incentivize better group behavior. The goal is to prompt a return to higher overall contributions, ultimately benefiting the collective.
*   **Forgiving and Prevents Spirals of Defection:** The strategy is designed to immediately return to cooperation as soon as the `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD` is met again. This prevents prolonged cycles of mutual defection, providing a clear and quick path back to full contribution for the group.
*   **Self-Protective for Viability:** The conditional defection and the last-round defection prevent this strategy from being persistently exploited by purely selfish players, ensuring its long-term viability in a tournament context while still promoting collective good.

This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocator (ACR)**, is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation while remaining adaptive and robust against various opponent behaviors, including free-riding and exploitation. It operates on the principle of conditional cooperation, reacting to the overall group's past contributions.

---

### **Adaptive Collective Reciprocator (ACR) Strategy**

**Core Principle:** Be a willing initial cooperator, maintain cooperation as long as a significant portion of the group contributes, and protect against exploitation by defecting when collective contributions significantly decline.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Play):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** To signal a willingness to cooperate and attempt to establish a baseline of collective contribution. This proactive cooperation is essential for initiating a mutually beneficial outcome.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to `r-1`):**
    *   At the start of each of these rounds, observe the `S_prev`, which is the total number of contributions made by all players in the *immediately preceding round*.
    *   **If `S_prev >= ceil(n / 2)`:**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   **Rationale:** A majority of the players (at least half) contributed in the previous round. This indicates a reasonable level of collective effort and willingness to cooperate within the group. By continuing to contribute, this strategy aims to sustain and reinforce this positive cooperative equilibrium.
    *   **Else (if `S_prev < ceil(n / 2)`):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale:** Fewer than half the players contributed in the previous round. This signifies a significant breakdown in collective cooperation or an increase in free-riding. Continuing to contribute under such conditions would lead to exploitation. Defecting protects individual payoff and signals a strong response to the lack of collective effort, potentially encouraging others to re-evaluate their actions in subsequent rounds.

3.  **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to influence. Backward induction dictates that individual rationality leads to defection, as there is no cost to future reputation or collective outcome. A robust strategy must acknowledge this game-theoretic reality, as any contribution in this round would be exploited by other rational players.

**Collective Alignment and Robustness:**

*   **Collective Mindset:** ACR actively promotes collective welfare by initiating cooperation and sustaining it when a sufficient number of peers also contribute. It's designed to encourage a high-payoff cooperative equilibrium for the group.
*   **Adaptiveness:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective actions of the group in the previous round, rather than following a rigid pattern.
*   **Robustness against Exploitation:** By defecting when collective contributions fall below a critical majority threshold, ACR prevents itself from being a "sucker" that continuously contributes while others free-ride. This mechanism ensures it's not easily exploited by purely selfish or opportunistic opponents.
*   **Robustness across Opponent Behaviors:**
    *   **Pure Cooperators:** If opponents are primarily cooperators, `S_prev` will remain high, and ACR will contribute consistently, leading to high collective payoffs.
    *   **Pure Defectors:** If opponents are primarily defectors, `S_prev` will quickly fall below `ceil(n/2)`, causing ACR to switch to defection, minimizing its losses.
    *   **Adaptive Strategies:** ACR provides a clear, consistent signal (cooperate when the group cooperates, defect when it doesn't). This transparency can facilitate coordination and the establishment of cooperative cycles with other reciprocal strategies.

The following strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**, is designed to foster and maintain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game, while being adaptive to observed behavior and robust to a variety of opponent strategies. It adheres to the specified game parameters and information constraints.

***

### Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)

**Parameters Used:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for total contributions (1 < k < n).

**History Used:**
*   After each round, all players observe every player's past actions and payoffs.
*   Let `N_C_prev` represent the total number of players who contributed (chose action 'C') in the *immediately preceding* round.

**Decision Rules for Player i in the current round:**

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy initiates with cooperation to signal a willingness to build and participate in a collective good. This provides an initial opportunity for all players to establish a cooperative equilibrium.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   **Observation:** Observe `N_C_prev` (the total number of contributions by all players in the previous round).
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `N_C_prev >= k`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If the collective good received a sufficiently high level of contributions (at least `k` players contributing), the strategy continues to support it. This threshold (`k`) is chosen because it is the game's multiplier for the public good, signifying a critical level of collective effort to make cooperation broadly beneficial. Maintaining cooperation reinforces the collective's ability to achieve mutual gains.
        *   **Else (if `N_C_prev < k`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If the total contributions fall below the critical threshold `k`, it indicates an insufficient commitment to the collective good. In this scenario, the strategy shifts to defection. This serves two purposes: to protect the individual player's immediate payoff when the collective is underperforming, and to act as a collective signal of disapproval, potentially incentivizing other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds if they wish to restore a more cooperative and profitable state for the group.

3.  **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a repeated game, there are no future interactions for which to build or maintain a reputation, nor any further opportunities to foster collective good. From an individual rationality standpoint, defecting (keeping one's token) is the dominant strategy, as there are no repercussions for future rounds. This acknowledges the finite nature of the game.

The following strategy is designed to promote collective welfare in the Public Goods Game while remaining adaptive and robust against a range of opponent behaviors in a tournament setting. It incorporates an initial trust phase, a responsive middle phase, and a rational end-game phase.

---

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Group Reciprocity (AGR)**

This strategy aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by adaptively responding to the overall group's behavior, while protecting itself from exploitation and acknowledging the finite nature of the game. It embodies a collective mindset by initiating cooperation and being forgiving, but also a pragmatic robustness against free-riding.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributed tokens (1 < k < n).

**Internal State Variable:**
*   `current_stance`: This variable tracks the player's current approach, either "Cooperative" or "Defensive". It is initialized to "Cooperative" at the start of the game.

**Adaptive Parameter:**
*   `Cooperation_Threshold`: This value determines the minimum proportion of cooperators required in the group to maintain or return to a cooperative stance. It is set dynamically based on the game's efficiency:
    *   `Cooperation_Threshold = max(0.5, k/n)`
    *   *Rationale*: A baseline expectation of 50% cooperation (`0.5`) is robust for sustaining the public good. If the public good is highly efficient (i.e., `k/n` is high, meaning a higher return on investment for contributed tokens), the strategy sets a higher expectation for cooperation, making it more demanding when the collective benefit is clearer. This encourages greater collective effort in more favorable conditions.

**Decision Rules (for Player `i` in Round `t`):**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Trust):**
    *   Player `i` **Contributes (C)**.
    *   *Rationale*: Initiate cooperation to signal a willingness to contribute and to test the collective's initial disposition. The `current_stance` remains "Cooperative".

2.  **Middle Rounds (Round `t` from 2 to `r-1`):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t`, Player `i` observes `C_round_t-1`, which is the total number of players who contributed in the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculate Group Cooperation:** Calculate `P_t-1 = C_round_t-1 / n`, the proportion of cooperators in round `t-1`.
    *   **Decision Logic based on `current_stance`:**

        *   **If `current_stance` is "Cooperative":**
            *   If `P_t-1 < Cooperation_Threshold`:
                *   Player `i` switches `current_stance` to "Defensive".
                *   Player `i` **Defects (D)**.
                *   *Rationale*: The observed level of cooperation in the group has fallen below the acceptable threshold, indicating significant free-riding or a breakdown in collective effort. Switching to "Defensive" and defecting protects Player `i` from further exploitation and signals disapproval, potentially encouraging others to increase their contributions.
            *   Else (`P_t-1 >= Cooperation_Threshold`):
                *   Player `i` **Contributes (C)**.
                *   *Rationale*: The observed level of cooperation is sufficient. Player `i` continues to contribute to sustain the public good. The `current_stance` remains "Cooperative".

        *   **If `current_stance` is "Defensive":**
            *   If `P_t-1 >= Cooperation_Threshold`:
                *   Player `i` switches `current_stance` to "Cooperative".
                *   Player `i` **Contributes (C)**.
                *   *Rationale*: The group has demonstrated a return to a sufficient level of cooperation. This strategy is forgiving and allows for re-establishing collective welfare, thus promoting the overall good.
            *   Else (`P_t-1 < Cooperation_Threshold`):
                *   Player `i` **Defects (D)**.
                *   *Rationale*: The group's cooperation level remains low, indicating continued free-riding or a persistent lack of collective effort. Player `i` maintains a defensive posture to avoid exploitation. The `current_stance` remains "Defensive".

3.  **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   Player `i` **Defects (D)**.
    *   *Rationale*: In a finitely repeated game with a known end, there are no future rounds for retaliation or reward. Following backward induction, the rational self-interested action in the final round is to defect, as there are no consequences for future interactions. This is a pragmatic necessity for robustness in a tournament setting.

This strategy balances a proactive pursuit of collective benefit with a reactive, self-protective mechanism, making it adaptive and robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors in the tournament environment.

description_COLLECTIVE_82 = '''
The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)", is designed for the Public Goods Game. It aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by initiating generosity, rewarding group contributions, forgiving minor lapses, and protecting against sustained exploitation. Its adaptability is tied to the game's parameters, specifically the multiplier `k`, and the observed history of play.

---

### Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR) Strategy

**Internal State Variables:**
*   `required_cooperators`: An integer representing the minimum number of players who must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to maintain contribution without escalating a "defection streak." This is dynamically calculated based on game parameters.
*   `forgiveness_rounds`: An integer representing the number of consecutive rounds of insufficient cooperation that this strategy will tolerate before defecting itself. (Default: 1 round)
*   `defection_streak`: An integer counter, initialized to 0, that tracks consecutive rounds where the observed number of cooperators falls below `required_cooperators`.

**1. Strategy Setup (Before Round 1):**

*   Calculate `required_cooperators`: `max(1, floor(n - (k - 1)))`
    *   **Rationale:** This threshold adapts to the strength of the public good.
        *   When `k` is large (meaning a strong collective benefit from contributions), `required_cooperators` will be lower, making the strategy more forgiving and encouraging, as fewer cooperators are needed to make group contribution worthwhile.
        *   When `k` is small (weak collective benefit), `required_cooperators` will be higher, making the strategy more stringent to prevent individual exploitation when the collective gain is marginal.
        *   `max(1, ...)` ensures that at least one cooperator is always required, preventing cooperation in a completely non-cooperative environment.
*   Set `forgiveness_rounds = 1`.
    *   **Rationale:** A small buffer allows for minor fluctuations or "testing" actions by other players without immediately retaliating, helping to re-establish cooperation after small dips.

**2. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Move):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** Always initiate cooperation to signal a willingness to contribute to the collective good and to explore the potential for mutual benefit. This is crucial for establishing a cooperative baseline.

*   **Round `r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no subsequent rounds for reciprocity or punishment to function. Contributing would be individually irrational and exploitable.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (1 < `current_round` < `r`):**
    1.  **Observe Past Actions:** Note `C_prev`, the total number of players who contributed in the previous round (`current_round` - 1).

    2.  **Evaluate Cooperation Level:**
        *   **If `C_prev >= required_cooperators`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
            *   Reset `defection_streak = 0`.
            *   **Rationale:** The level of cooperation in the group is sufficient or strong enough. Reward this by continuing to contribute, maintaining the collective effort.

        *   **Else (`C_prev < required_cooperators`):**
            *   Increment `defection_streak`.
            *   **If `defection_streak <= forgiveness_rounds`:**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
                *   **Rationale:** The group's cooperation level is currently below the desired threshold, but it's within the grace period. This strategy offers a chance for the group to correct itself, demonstrating continued good faith despite a slight shortfall.
            *   **Else (`defection_streak > forgiveness_rounds`):**
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
                *   **Rationale:** The group has demonstrated a sustained lack of sufficient cooperation, indicating consistent free-riding or an unwillingness to contribute adequately. This strategy must protect itself from continued exploitation by switching to defection.

**3. Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** The strategy always starts by contributing, giving others a clear signal of its cooperative intent.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** It consistently contributes when the group's cooperation meets or exceeds a carefully calculated threshold, actively participating in and encouraging collective welfare.
*   **Adaptive Tolerance:** The `required_cooperators` threshold dynamically adjusts based on `k`, ensuring the strategy is more lenient when cooperation yields greater collective benefits and more cautious when benefits are marginal, thereby optimizing overall group outcomes.
*   **Forgiveness and Recovery:** The `forgiveness_rounds` parameter allows for temporary dips in group cooperation, providing an opportunity for the group to self-correct without immediately collapsing into mutual defection. This facilitates the re-establishment of cooperation.
*   **Robustness against Exploitation:** While promoting cooperation, the strategy is not blindly altruistic. It will defect if the group's lack of contribution is sustained, protecting its own interests against persistent free-riders and preventing complete exploitation. This balance is crucial for survival in a tournament context while still striving for collective good.

STRATEGY NAME: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity

OVERVIEW:
This strategy is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It initiates play with a cooperative action and then adaptively responds to the observed level of group cooperation. Its objective is to promote overall welfare within the group while protecting itself from exploitation by consistently uncooperative players. The strategy balances the pursuit of collective benefit with the need for robustness in a competitive tournament environment.

DECISION RULES:

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy begins with an act of good faith. Contributing in the first round signals a willingness to invest in the public good and encourages all other players to reciprocate, thereby initiating a cycle of cooperation.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`):**
    *   **Observation:** After each round `t-1`, the strategy observes the actions of all `n` players. It calculates `C_prev_round_count`, which is the total number of players (including itself) who contributed 1 token in the preceding round.
    *   **Calculate Cooperation Rate:** The `Cooperation_Rate` for the previous round is determined by `Cooperation_Rate = C_prev_round_count / n`.
    *   **Dynamic Cooperation Threshold (TP):** This strategy employs a dynamic threshold to determine the minimum acceptable level of collective cooperation required to continue contributing. This threshold adapts to the game's specific parameters, `k` and `n`, reflecting the potential returns from cooperation:
        `TP = max(0.5, 0.25 + k / (2 * n))`
        *   This formula ensures that the strategy always requires at least 50% (`0.5`) of players to cooperate.
        *   If the `k/n` ratio is higher (indicating greater individual benefit from collective contributions), the `TP` value increases. This means the strategy demands a higher level of group cooperation when the game's structure makes such cooperation more rewarding and, therefore, more achievable.
        *   The strategy calculates the `Min_Cooperators` required for the current round: `Min_Cooperators = ceil(TP * n)`.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   If `Cooperation_Rate >= TP` (i.e., `C_prev_round_count >= Min_Cooperators`):
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** The observed level of collective cooperation is sufficient. The strategy continues to contribute to sustain the public good and foster ongoing collective welfare.
        *   Else (`Cooperation_Rate < TP`):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** The collective cooperation has fallen below the acceptable threshold. To avoid being exploited and to signal that a higher level of group contribution is necessary, the strategy switches to defection. This serves as a deterrent against free-riding and encourages other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds to re-establish cooperation.

3.  **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finitely repeated game, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. Therefore, the individually rational choice is to defect to maximize personal payoff, as there is no longer an opportunity to build or rebuild collective welfare.

COLLECTIVE ALIGNMENT:
This strategy is inherently aligned with a collective mindset by actively attempting to initiate and maintain high levels of group cooperation. It demonstrates a willingness to contribute to the common good (starting with cooperation) and continuously assesses the group's commitment to that goal. The adaptive `TP` ensures that the strategy's expectations for cooperation are reasonable given the game's structure, promoting an equitable distribution of effort. While it employs defection, this is primarily a defensive measure to prevent disproportionate exploitation and to incentivize a return to collective contribution, rather than a purely selfish act. Its ultimate aim is to maximize the overall benefit for the group when conditions allow, while remaining robust in competitive scenarios.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_84 = '''
Here is a collective strategy designed for the Public Goods Game, emphasizing adaptability, robustness, and a collective mindset within the constraints of a tournament setting.

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Conditional Cooperator (ACC)

**Core Principle:** This strategy aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by initiating a pro-social action, then conditionally reciprocating based on the group's observed behavior. It recognizes the finite nature of the game and protects against exploitation while encouraging a high level of collective contribution.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Final Round Check (Endgame Effect):**
    *   If the `current_round` is equal to the total number of rounds (`r`), then **Defect (D)**.
        *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions to reward cooperation or punish defection. Individual rationality dictates defecting, as there's no incentive to contribute to the common pool. This "endgame effect" is a robust feature of finite repeated games.

2.  **Initial Round (Pro-Social Signal):**
    *   If the `current_round` is 1 (and `r > 1`, as the final round rule takes precedence for `r=1`), then **Contribute (C)**.
        *   *Rationale:* Starting with a contribution signals willingness to cooperate and provides an opportunity for the group to establish a cooperative pattern. This initiates the game with a pro-social action, exploring the potential for collective benefit.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < `current_round` < `r`):**
    *   Observe the actions from the `previous_round`.
    *   Count `C_prev`, the total number of players (including ourselves) who contributed (C) in the `previous_round`.
    *   Calculate `P_C = C_prev / n`, which is the proportion of cooperators in the `previous_round`.
    *   **Decision based on collective contribution:**
        *   **If `P_C >= 0.5`:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* This strategy adopts a "conditional cooperator" approach. If a majority (at least 50%) of players contributed in the previous round, it signifies sufficient collective effort to warrant continued personal contribution. This threshold encourages the formation and maintenance of a cooperative norm, aiming to achieve higher collective payoffs for the group. It rewards collective pro-social behavior.
        *   **Else (`P_C < 0.5`):** **Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* If less than half the players contributed, it indicates a significant decline in collective effort or an increase in free-riding. In such cases, defecting serves to protect the player from being consistently exploited. It also acts as a signal that the group needs to increase its collective contribution to re-engage cooperation.

**Robustness and Collective Alignment:**

*   **Adaptive:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of the entire group in the previous round, making it responsive to prevailing collective norms.
*   **Robust:** It balances the desire for collective good with self-protection. It avoids being an unconditional cooperator (which can be easily exploited) and is not a pure defector (which prevents any collective gain). This makes it resilient against a variety of opponent strategies.
*   **Collective Mindset:**
    *   It proactively attempts to initiate cooperation in the first round.
    *   It supports and sustains cooperation when a significant collective effort is observed (via the 50% threshold).
    *   By defecting when collective contribution is low, it implicitly tries to "teach" or encourage other players to contribute more, thus striving for a higher collective outcome over time.
    *   The "last round" defection is a standard rational choice in finite games and does not contradict the strategy's collective goal within the repeated game context, as incentives for cooperation collapse for all players at that point.

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**

**Core Principles:**
The Adaptive Collective Reciprocity strategy is designed to foster and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game, balancing the desire for collective welfare with the need for individual protection against free-riding. It acts as a "generous cooperator" that gives others a chance to contribute but responds firmly to persistent non-cooperation. This strategy aims to establish a high level of trust and contribution within the group by demonstrating initial cooperation and then adapting based on the observed collective effort of others.

---

**1. Specify Decision Rules - When do you cooperate vs defect?**

*   **Round 1 (Initiation of Trust):**
    *   In the very first round (`round = 1`), this strategy will always **CONTRIBUTE (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This action signals a willingness to invest in the collective good and attempts to establish an initial foundation of cooperation. It's an open invitation for all players to begin contributing towards the shared benefit.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Adaptive Reciprocity):**
    *   For any round `t` where `1 < t < r` (i.e., not the first or the last round), the strategy will adapt its action based on the previous round's group behavior:
        1.  **Observe Past Behavior:** Examine the actions of *all other players* (excluding this agent's own action) in the immediately preceding round (`round = t-1`).
        2.  **Calculate Collective Contribution Rate:** Determine the proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round. Let this be `P_others_cooperated`.
            *   `P_others_cooperated = (Number of other players who contributed in round t-1) / (n - 1)`
        3.  **Decision Threshold:**
            *   If `P_others_cooperated >= 0.5` (i.e., a majority or more of other players contributed): This strategy will **CONTRIBUTE (C)**.
                *   *Rationale:* A `0.5` threshold means that if at least half of the other players are contributing, the strategy will continue to support the collective project. This encourages and rewards collective effort, reinforcing cooperation and aiming for the higher group payoff. It's a forgiving threshold, designed to maintain cooperation even if some free-riding occurs.
            *   If `P_others_cooperated < 0.5` (i.e., less than a majority of other players contributed): This strategy will **DEFECT (D)**.
                *   *Rationale:* A low collective contribution rate indicates that cooperation is faltering or that significant free-riding is occurring. In this scenario, the strategy will defect to protect its own endowment and to signal that a lack of sufficient collective commitment will lead to a withdrawal of support. This response acts as a gentle punishment mechanism, intended to encourage others to contribute more in subsequent rounds or to minimize losses if the group is unwilling to cooperate.

*   **Last Round (Endgame Strategy):**
    *   In the very last round of the game (`round = r`), this strategy will always **DEFECT (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In a finite repeated game with a known end, there are no future rounds for cooperative or retaliatory actions to have any effect. According to the principle of backward induction, the individually rational dominant strategy in the final round is to defect, as there are no consequences for free-riding. This strategy acknowledges this game theory principle to avoid exploitation.

---

**2. Handle Edge Cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?**

*   **First Round (`round = 1`):** As detailed above, always **CONTRIBUTE (C)** to initiate cooperation.
*   **Last Round (`round = r`):** As detailed above, always **DEFECT (D)** due to the absence of future consequences.
*   **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < round < r`):** The adaptive reciprocity rule based on `P_others_cooperated` handles all rounds between the first and the last.

---

**3. Be Collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset**

The Adaptive Collective Reciprocity strategy embodies a collective mindset through the following aspects:

*   **Initiation of Cooperation:** By unconditionally contributing in the first round, the strategy takes the initial risk to kickstart collective action, actively striving for the maximal `n * k` group payoff.
*   **Support for Collective Effort:** It prioritizes sustaining cooperation as long as a significant portion (a majority) of other players are also contributing. This demonstrates a willingness to contribute to the common good, even when individual incentives might suggest otherwise in the short term, to foster a long-term cooperative environment.
*   **Pragmatic Protection:** While valuing collective welfare, the strategy also includes a robust mechanism to prevent being continuously exploited. The `0.5` threshold ensures that contributions are not made indefinitely if others are not participating sufficiently. This pragmatic approach ultimately encourages broader participation, as sustained defection by others will eventually lead to a collapse of contributions from this strategy, making free-riding less profitable overall.
*   **Adaptability for Group Dynamics:** By observing and responding to the group's real-time cooperation levels, the strategy is constantly trying to nudge the group towards higher collective contributions, rather than rigidly sticking to a pre-defined path that might fail if the group dynamic is uncooperative.

This strategy is called "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity." It is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation by rewarding others' contributions and deterring free-riding, while remaining robust in a competitive tournament environment.

### Adaptive Collective Reciprocity Strategy

This strategy operates based on the round number and the observed past actions of other players.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier (where `1 < k < n`).

**Key Variable:**
*   `C_others_prev`: The sum of contributions from *all other players* in the immediately preceding round. (i.e., for player `i`, this is `sum_{j != i} c_j` from the previous round).

---

#### 1. First Round (Round 1)

*   **Action**: Contribute (C).
*   **Rationale**: Start with an act of cooperation to signal willingness to contribute to the public good and to establish a positive baseline for collective welfare. This sets an initial tone for potential group cooperation.

---

#### 2. Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`)

*   **Information Used**: After each round, observe `C_others_prev`, which is the total number of tokens contributed by *all other players* in the previous round.
*   **Decision Rule**:
    1.  **Calculate the Cooperation Threshold for Others**: Determine the minimum number of contributions expected from other players.
        *   `Threshold = ceil((n - 1) / 2)`
        *   This threshold signifies that at least half of the *other* players must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to continue cooperating.
    2.  **Conditional Action**:
        *   **If `C_others_prev >= Threshold`**: **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale**: This rewards sufficient cooperation from the rest of the group. If other players are contributing adequately, this strategy continues to support the collective effort, reinforcing cooperative behavior and aiming to maximize overall group benefits.
        *   **If `C_others_prev < Threshold`**: **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale**: This acts as a punishment or a signal of dissatisfaction when the level of cooperation from others is deemed insufficient. It deters free-riding and attempts to incentivize greater contributions in subsequent rounds, protecting against being exploited by a predominantly defecting group.

---

#### 3. Last Round (Round `r`)

*   **Action**: Defect (D).
*   **Rationale**: In a finitely repeated game, the final round eliminates any future consequences for current actions. Backward induction dictates that the individually rational strategy is to defect, as there's no opportunity for reciprocity or punishment in subsequent rounds. This protects the player from being exploited by others who will also rationally defect in the last round.

---

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**
This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation**: Starting with a contribution in Round 1 demonstrates a willingness to contribute to the collective good.
*   **Promoting Conditional Cooperation**: By making continued cooperation contingent on others' contributions, the strategy aims to establish and maintain a high level of reciprocal cooperation across the group. It seeks to achieve a state where a majority of players contribute, leading to significantly higher collective welfare compared to universal defection.
*   **Balancing Idealism with Robustness**: While striving for collective benefit, it incorporates a robust mechanism to prevent individual exploitation by free-riders (through conditional defection) and by the end-game effect (through last-round defection). This balance makes it viable in a competitive tournament where not all opponents may share a similar collective goal.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_87 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Cooperator," aims to establish and sustain a high level of cooperation within the group. It is designed to be adaptive by reacting to observed group behavior and robust to a variety of opponent strategies, while also accounting for the finite nature of the game.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n).

**Decision Rules for Player i in Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **If `t == r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale: In the final round of a finite repeated game, the dominant individual strategy is to defect. This strategy acts rationally to avoid exploitation by others who will also defect in the absence of future interactions.*

2.  **If `t == 1` (First Round):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale: This strategy always begins by contributing. This serves as an initial signal of willingness to cooperate and tests the group's potential for collective action, aiming to kickstart a cooperative equilibrium.*

3.  **If `1 < t < r` (Intermediate Rounds):**
    *   **Observation:** Review the actions from the immediately preceding round (`t-1`). Calculate `num_cooperators_prev`, which is the total number of players who contributed (C) in round `t-1`.
    *   **Define `Cooperation_Threshold`:** Set `Cooperation_Threshold = ceil(n * 0.6)`.
        *   *Rationale: This threshold represents the minimum number of contributions required from the group in the previous round to sustain cooperation. It aims for a significant majority (more than 50%) to ensure that collective effort is robust and not easily undermined by a few defectors, while still being achievable enough to foster cooperation.*
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `num_cooperators_prev >= Cooperation_Threshold`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale: The group demonstrated a sufficient level of cooperation in the previous round. This strategy rewards and reinforces such collective behavior by continuing to contribute, aiming to maximize the overall collective payoff.*
        *   Else (`num_cooperators_prev < Cooperation_Threshold`):
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale: If the observed level of cooperation falls below the defined threshold, this strategy defects. This acts as a deterrent against widespread defection, protecting itself from exploitation and signaling that cooperation must be reciprocated to be sustained.*

**Collective Mindset and Robustness:**

*   **Collective Mindset:** This strategy embodies a collective mindset by proactively attempting to establish and sustain cooperation. It takes the initial risk of contributing and continues to contribute as long as a significant portion of the group reciprocates, seeking to achieve the mutually beneficial outcome of widespread contributions.
*   **Adaptiveness:** Its decisions are adaptive, directly responding to the observed collective behavior of the group in the previous round.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   It's robust against always-defecting strategies because it will quickly switch to defection, preventing long-term exploitation.
    *   It's robust against always-cooperating strategies by sustaining cooperation, maximizing collective (and thus individual) benefits.
    *   The `Cooperation_Threshold` allows for some level of individual defection without immediately collapsing the collective effort, providing a degree of forgiveness crucial for maintaining cooperation in diverse groups.
    *   Explicitly handles the end-game effect to prevent unnecessary exploitation in the final round.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_88 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperator," aims to foster and maintain cooperation by being conditionally cooperative, adapting its behavior based on the observed collective effort in prior rounds. It balances the pursuit of collective welfare with the need for self-protection against widespread defection, particularly in a tournament setting with diverse and unknown opponent strategies.

---

**Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperator Strategy**

**Core Principle:** This strategy promotes cooperation when the collective contribution to the public good is sufficiently high, and temporarily withdraws cooperation when participation falls below a critical threshold. It starts by signaling a willingness to cooperate and accounts for the final round's unique incentives.

**1. First Round (Round 1):**
   *   **Decision:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
   *   **Rationale:** Begin by signaling a strong willingness to cooperate and establish a cooperative baseline for the game. This gives all players an opportunity to initiate a positive collective dynamic.

**2. Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`):**
   *   **Information Used:** After each round, all players observe every player's past actions and payoffs. Let `C_prev` be the total number of players who contributed (i.e., `sum_j c_j`) in the *immediately preceding round*.
   *   **Cooperation Threshold Calculation:** Determine a dynamic cooperation threshold, `T`, for the current round based on the game parameters `n` (number of players) and `k` (multiplier):
      `T = max(k, ceil(n / 2))`
      *   **`k` (the multiplier):** This ensures that a sufficient number of contributions (`k` or more) are made to generate a collectively meaningful return from the public good. Below `k`, the collective project's efficiency is questionable.
      *   **`ceil(n / 2)` (a simple majority):** This ensures that at least a majority of players are participating, reflecting a broad base of collective effort. This guards against scenarios where `k` is very low, which might otherwise lead to cooperation even when only a few players contribute, making the strategy vulnerable to exploitation.
      *   The strategy uses `max()` to take the higher of these two values, establishing a robust and fair bar for continued cooperation, adapting to different game parameter settings.
   *   **Decision Rule:**
      *   If `C_prev >= T`: **Contribute (C)**. The collective effort meets or exceeds the established threshold, warranting continued cooperation to sustain the public good.
      *   If `C_prev < T`: **Defect (D)**. The collective effort is insufficient. This action serves as a punishment for widespread defection, signals a demand for greater participation, and protects the strategy from being a "sucker" in a low-cooperation environment.

**3. Last Round (Round `r`):**
   *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
   *   **Rationale:** In the final round, the "endgame effect" dictates that there are no future rounds for reciprocal actions to matter. The individually rational strategy is to defect to maximize one's own payoff. This strategy acknowledges this to avoid exploitation.

---

**Summary of Adaptive Nature and Robustness:**
*   **Adaptive:** The strategy adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of others in the previous round and adapts its threshold (`T`) dynamically based on the specific game parameters (`n` and `k`).
*   **Robust:**
    *   It initiates cooperation, providing an opportunity for collective success.
    *   It employs conditional cooperation, rewarding participation and punishing insufficient collective effort, making it resistant to consistent exploitation by free-riders.
    *   The `max(k, ceil(n / 2))` threshold intelligently balances the collective benefit multiplier with a robust majority rule, preventing it from being too lenient (if `k` is small) or overly strict (if `k` is large).
    *   It accounts for the "endgame effect," a known vulnerability in repeated games, to secure its final round payoff.
    *   Its simplicity and clear rules contribute to its robustness against a wide range of unknown opponent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_89 = '''
This strategy, named "Parametric Adaptive Contributor," is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It adapts its behavior based on the game's parameters and observed history, aiming for high collective welfare while remaining robust against exploitation.

**Game Parameters and Internal Calculation:**

*   **`n`**: Total number of players.
*   **`r`**: Total number of rounds.
*   **`k`**: Multiplier for contributions (where `1 < k < n`).

Before the game begins, the strategy calculates a **Cooperation Threshold (`C_threshold`)** which determines the minimum number of cooperators required in the previous round for this strategy to continue cooperating. This threshold dynamically adjusts based on the game's inherent incentive structure:

1.  **Marginal Per Capita Return (MPCR):** First, calculate `MPCR = k / n`. This value represents the individual benefit received for each unit contributed to the public good. Since `1 < k < n`, `0 < MPCR < 1`.

2.  **Required Cooperation Proportion:** The strategy determines a target proportion of players who must have contributed in the previous round to signal sufficient collective commitment. This proportion is set as:
    `Required_Cooperation_Proportion = 1 - MPCR`.
    *   A lower `MPCR` (meaning individual contributions yield less collective benefit, making cooperation harder) results in a higher `Required_Cooperation_Proportion` (demanding more collective effort to justify continued cooperation).
    *   A higher `MPCR` (meaning individual contributions yield significant collective benefit, making cooperation easier) results in a lower `Required_Cooperation_Proportion` (allowing for more leniency in observed cooperation).

3.  **Integer Cooperation Threshold (`C_threshold`):** Convert this proportion into an integer number of players:
    `C_threshold = ceil(n * Required_Cooperation_Proportion)`.
    Since `1 < k < n`, `n * (1 - k/n)` simplifies to `n - k`, which is an integer between 1 and `n-1`. Therefore, `C_threshold` will always be an integer between 1 and `n-1`.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Move):**
    *   **Contribute (C)**.
    *   Rationale: The strategy always initiates cooperation in the first round. This is a proactive step to signal its willingness to contribute to the collective good and to encourage the establishment of a cooperative equilibrium among players.

2.  **Rounds 2 through (r-1) (Adaptive Play):**
    *   At the beginning of each of these rounds, the strategy observes `C_prev`, which is the **total number of players who contributed** in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   **If `C_prev >= C_threshold`**:
        *   **Contribute (C)**.
        *   Rationale: The observed level of collective cooperation in the previous round meets or exceeds the calculated threshold. This indicates that the group is demonstrating sufficient commitment to the public good, and this strategy reciprocates that cooperation to sustain collective welfare.
    *   **Else (`C_prev < C_threshold`)**:
        *   **Defect (D)** (contribute 0 tokens).
        *   Rationale: The observed level of collective cooperation fell below the required threshold. This strategy defects to avoid being exploited by free-riders and to signal that greater collective effort is needed to restore cooperation. This acts as a form of "punishment" to incentivize future contributions.

3.  **Round r (Final Round):**
    *   **Defect (D)** (contribute 0 tokens).
    *   Rationale: In the final round of a finitely repeated game, there are no future consequences or opportunities for reciprocity. The individually rational choice in this scenario is to defect, as there is no benefit to contributing.

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** By initiating with a contribution, the strategy actively tries to establish a state of high collective payoff for all players.
*   **Context-Sensitive Reciprocity:** The dynamic `C_threshold` ensures that the strategy's cooperation is aligned with the specific difficulty of sustaining collective action. It sets a higher bar for cooperation when contributions are less impactful (low `MPCR`) and is more forgiving when contributions are highly impactful (high `MPCR`). This promotes sustainable cooperation under varying conditions.
*   **Protection Against Exploitation:** While striving for collective welfare, the strategy's conditional defection mechanism protects it from being a "sucker," thereby preventing the complete breakdown of potential cooperation by incentivizing others to contribute. This indirect pressure ultimately serves the collective goal by making free-riding less attractive in the long run.

The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Effort," is designed to foster cooperation in the Public Goods Game by initiating cooperative behavior and then adapting its decisions based on the observed level of collective contribution from the group. It balances the pursuit of collective welfare with the need for robustness against exploitation.

---

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Effort

This strategy aims to maximize overall group utility, including its own, by promoting widespread cooperation. It starts by demonstrating a willingness to contribute and then adjusts its behavior based on the group's past actions, ensuring it doesn't become a consistent free-rider victim.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initiation):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** To signal a clear intent to cooperate and to initiate a positive feedback loop for the collective good. This sets an expectation for other players.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Cooperation):**
    *   Before making a decision in the current round `t`, observe the actions of all players in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   Calculate `N_C_prev`, which is the total number of players who chose to **Contribute (C)** in round `t-1`.
    *   **Threshold for Collective Effort:** The strategy defines a threshold based on the total number of players `n`. This threshold is set at `ceil(n / 2)`. This represents a 'critical mass' or 'majority' level of participation.
    *   **Action:**
        *   **If `N_C_prev >= ceil(n / 2)`:**
            *   **Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* If a significant portion (at least half) of the group demonstrated collective effort in the previous round, this strategy rewards that effort by continuing its contribution. This reinforces cooperation when the group is pulling its weight.
        *   **Else (`N_C_prev < ceil(n / 2)`):**
            *   **Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* If collective effort falls below the critical mass, this strategy withholds its contribution. This acts as a collective "punishment" or a signal that more effort is required from the group to sustain cooperation, aiming to deter widespread free-riding.

3.  **Round `r` (Final Round):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. To protect itself from exploitation by other players who are likely to defect due to backward induction, this strategy prioritizes its final individual payoff.

**Edge Cases Handled:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly defined as a cooperative move to establish a basis for collective action.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly defined as a defection to prevent exploitation when the "shadow of the future" disappears.
*   **Intermediate Rounds:** Behavior is adaptive, depending on the observed group cooperation from the immediate past.

**Collective Alignment:**

This strategy embodies a collective mindset by actively attempting to foster and sustain high levels of group cooperation. It starts with an act of good faith and continues to contribute when the group demonstrates a strong, measurable commitment to the public good (at least half of the players contributing). By withholding cooperation when this collective effort wanes, it creates an incentive structure for the group to maintain a higher overall contribution rate, thereby maximizing the aggregate payoffs for all participants, including itself, over the long run. The use of `ceil(n / 2)` as a threshold provides a consistent and robust measure of collective engagement across different game parameters.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_91 = '''
This strategy, named the **Adaptive Group Reciprocator (AGR)**, aims to foster collective cooperation while remaining adaptive and robust in a tournament setting. It starts with a cooperative stance, monitors the overall group's contribution level, and adjusts its own behavior and future expectations accordingly. The strategy explicitly handles the end-game dilemma to prevent exploitation.

**Core Principles:**
*   **Initial Trust:** Begin by cooperating to signal willingness to build collective welfare.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** React to the overall group's cooperation level, not just individual actions.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** Adjust expectations for cooperation based on observed history, becoming more lenient when the group cooperates well, and stricter when it falters.
*   **Robustness:** Protect against systematic exploitation, especially in the game's final stages.

**Strategy Details:**

**State Variable:**
*   `Dynamic_Cooperation_Threshold`: A value between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the minimum acceptable average contribution rate from the group to continue contributing.

**Initial Setup (Before Round 1):**
*   Initialize `Dynamic_Cooperation_Threshold = 0.5`.
    *   *Rationale:* This sets a moderate initial expectation, requiring at least half the players to contribute to sustain cooperation in subsequent rounds.

**Decision Rules by Round:**

1.  **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* Establish a cooperative baseline and signal a readiness to contribute to the public good. This is a common strategy to initiate cooperation in repeated games.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Intermediate Rounds):**
    *   **Action Determination:**
        *   Observe the actions of all `n` players from the *immediately preceding round* (`t-1`).
        *   Calculate the `Group_Cooperation_Rate` for round `t-1`:
            `Group_Cooperation_Rate = (sum of c_j for all players j in round t-1) / n`
        *   **If `Group_Cooperation_Rate >= Dynamic_Cooperation_Threshold`:**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* The group met or exceeded expectations; continue to support collective action.
        *   **Else (if `Group_Cooperation_Rate < Dynamic_Cooperation_Threshold`):**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* The group's cooperation was insufficient, signaling potential exploitation or breakdown of collective effort. Defect to protect individual payoff and incentivize future cooperation.

    *   **Dynamic Threshold Update (After Action and Observing Current Round `t` Outcomes):**
        *   After round `t` concludes and `Group_Cooperation_Rate` for round `t` is observed:
            *   **If `Group_Cooperation_Rate >= 0.75` (High Cooperation):**
                `Dynamic_Cooperation_Threshold = max(0.4, Dynamic_Cooperation_Threshold - 0.05)`
                *   *Rationale:* Reward high cooperation by becoming slightly more lenient, encouraging continued collective trust. The lower bound of 0.4 prevents becoming too naive.
            *   **If `0.5 <= Group_Cooperation_Rate < 0.75` (Moderate Cooperation):**
                `Dynamic_Cooperation_Threshold` remains unchanged.
                *   *Rationale:* Maintain current expectations as the group is performing moderately well.
            *   **If `Group_Cooperation_Rate < 0.5` (Low Cooperation):**
                `Dynamic_Cooperation_Threshold = min(0.9, Dynamic_Cooperation_Threshold + 0.1)`
                *   *Rationale:* Punish low cooperation by becoming stricter, demanding a higher level of future cooperation. The upper bound of 0.9 prevents the threshold from becoming impossible to meet.

3.  **Round `r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. Game theory predicts that all rational players will defect. To remain robust and avoid exploitation, especially in a tournament against other AI systems, this strategy defects. While this deviates from a purely "collective" ideal, it is a necessary self-preservation measure given the game mechanics and the "robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors" requirement.

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**
The Adaptive Group Reciprocator strategy is designed to promote and sustain cooperation among all players. It initiates cooperation, rewards collective effort, and is willing to reduce its demands when cooperation flourishes. Its responses to defection are aimed at restoring cooperation by signaling that exploitation is costly. The dynamic adjustment of the threshold attempts to find a stable equilibrium where cooperation can thrive. The only deviation from a purely collective ideal is in the final round, which is a strategic necessity for robustness in a competitive environment where other agents are expected to act purely self-interestedly.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_92 = '''
Here is a collective strategy designed for the Public Goods Game, emphasizing adaptive behavior and robustness in a tournament setting:

---

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Trust Builder**

This strategy aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by initiating goodwill, adaptively responding to the group's contribution levels, and protecting against exploitation, especially in the game's final stages. It is designed to encourage beneficial collective outcomes without being a naive cooperator.

**Decision Logic for Player i in the Current Round:**

1.  **Initial Goodwill Phase (Round 1):**
    *   In the very first round (`current_round = 1`), Player i **Contributes (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This action serves as an opening gesture of trust and a signal of willingness to cooperate. It attempts to kickstart a positive cycle of contributions within the group.

2.  **Adaptive Reciprocity Phase (Rounds 2 to r-2):**
    *   For all rounds from `current_round = 2` up to `current_round = r - 2`, Player i evaluates the recent collective behavior of *other players*.
    *   **Calculate `P_others_avg` (Average Cooperation Rate of Others):**
        *   Determine the average proportion of *all other players* (excluding Player i) who chose to Contribute in the preceding `W` rounds.
        *   The look-back window `W` is dynamic: `W = min(5, current_round - 1)`. This means we consider the immediate past round's behavior initially, gradually expanding to a review of the past 5 rounds as the game progresses.
        *   *Calculation:* `P_others_avg = (Total contributions by all players EXCEPT Player i over the last W rounds) / (W * (n - 1))`
    *   **Decision Based on `P_others_avg`:**
        *   If `P_others_avg >= 0.5` (i.e., at least 50% of other players have, on average, contributed in the recent past): Player i **Contributes (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* This reinforces cooperation when the group demonstrates a sufficient collective effort. It signals continued trust and commitment to the shared project.
        *   If `P_others_avg < 0.5`: Player i **Defects (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* This acts as a conditional punishment. If the collective effort falls below a reasonable threshold, Player i signals dissatisfaction, aiming to encourage other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds or to protect against being exploited by widespread free-riding.

3.  **Endgame Defection Phase (Rounds r-1 and r):**
    *   In the final two rounds of the game (`current_round = r - 1` or `current_round = r`), Player i **Defects (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This accounts for the well-known "end-game effect" in repeated games with a known finite horizon. As there are no future rounds for retaliation, the incentive to free-ride becomes dominant for rational players. Defecting in these final rounds protects Player i from being exploited by others who will likely defect.

---

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Starting with a contribution to signal goodwill and encourage mutual benefit.
*   **Promoting Conditional Cooperation:** It rewards sufficient collective effort with continued cooperation and punishes sustained defection, thereby attempting to steer the group towards a higher overall contribution level, which maximizes collective welfare.
*   **Adaptive and Robust:** It learns from past behavior to adjust its actions, making it robust against a range of opponents, from purely cooperative to entirely selfish.
*   **Protecting Collective Gains:** While aiming for collective good, it avoids being a "sucker" that is consistently exploited, ensuring its own tournament performance aligns with the goal of overall success, which often involves encouraging others to cooperate.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t` (where `t` is between 2 and `r-1`), observe the actions of all `n` players from the previous round (round `t-1`).
    *   **Calculation:** Count the number of players who contributed (C) in round `t-1`. Let this be `N_C_previous`.
    *   **Cooperation Threshold:** Calculate the dynamic cooperation threshold: `T = ceil(n / 2.0)`. This means that if at least half of the players (rounded up for odd `n`) contributed, the strategy considers the group sufficiently cooperative.
    *   **Conditional Action:**
        *   **If `N_C_previous >= T`:** Contribute (C) in the current round.
            *   **Rationale:** The majority of players are actively contributing to the public good. By continuing to contribute, the strategy supports and encourages sustained collective welfare, even if individual free-riders exist.
        *   **Else (`N_C_previous < T`):** Defect (D) in the current round.
            *   **Rationale:** A significant portion of the group (a majority) is not contributing. Continuing to contribute in such a scenario would lead to being exploited by free-riders without achieving robust collective benefit. Defecting serves as an adaptive response to signal that cooperation requires collective effort and to prevent excessive individual loss.

3.  **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence or incentivize cooperation. Based on backward induction, the individually rational choice for any player is to defect to maximize their immediate payoff, regardless of others' actions. Contributing in the last round would likely result in exploitation.

**Collective Alignment and Robustness:**
*   **Collective Mindset:** The strategy prioritizes the establishment and maintenance of collective cooperation by starting with a contribution and rewarding collective contributions above a certain threshold. It aims to achieve the higher collective payoff (where everyone contributes and receives `k` instead of `1`).
*   **Adaptive:** It dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the group's performance in the preceding round, rather than sticking to a rigid, exploitable pattern.
*   **Robust:** It can withstand a certain level of free-riding (up to `T-1` players) without immediately collapsing into universal defection. It also protects itself from sustained exploitation by defecting when collective effort falls below the threshold. It correctly anticipates the dynamics of the final round.
*   **Tournament Compatibility:** The strategy relies solely on observable past actions and game parameters, requiring no communication or assumed shared norms, making it suitable for a diverse tournament environment.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_94 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity," is designed to foster and maintain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game while being robust against exploitation. It aims for the collective optimum by conditionally contributing, adapting its behavior based on the group's past performance, and using the game's multiplier `k` as a crucial indicator of collective health.

**Core Principles:**
*   **Initiate Cooperation:** Start by contributing to signal willingness to cooperate and explore the potential for collective benefit.
*   **Conditional Cooperation:** Continue contributing only if the collective demonstrates sufficient effort in contributing to the public good.
*   **Deter Free-Riding:** Defect when collective contributions fall below a critical threshold, signaling that free-riding is not tolerated and aiming to encourage a return to cooperation.
*   **Rational Exit:** Defect in the final round when there are no future interactions to influence.

---

**Strategy Description: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity**

This strategy operates in rounds, observing the collective history to determine its current action.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action: CONTRIBUTE (C)**
    *   *Rationale:* In the initial round, the strategy always cooperates. This serves as an opening move to signal a willingness to contribute to the public good and to test the waters for potential collective cooperation among all players.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 through `r-1`):**
    *   **Observation:** The strategy observes the total contributions from the *immediately preceding round*. Let `S_prev` be the sum of `c_j` (all players' contributions) from the previous round.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `S_prev >= k` (the game's multiplier):**
            *   **Action: CONTRIBUTE (C)**
            *   *Rationale:* If the total contributions in the previous round met or exceeded the multiplier `k`, it indicates that the collective is performing reasonably well, generating sufficient value from the public good. In this scenario, the strategy rewards and seeks to sustain this level of collective cooperation by contributing. This `k` threshold represents a minimum acceptable level of group investment.
        *   **If `S_prev < k` (the game's multiplier):**
            *   **Action: DEFECT (D)**
            *   *Rationale:* If the total contributions in the previous round fell below the multiplier `k`, it signifies that too many players are free-riding or that collective cooperation has significantly deteriorated, making contributions individually unrewarding in the long run. In this case, the strategy defects to avoid being exploited, to punish insufficient collective effort, and to signal that the current level of free-riding is unacceptable. This aims to prompt a re-evaluation of contribution levels by other players.

*   **Last Round (`r`, the final round):**
    *   **Action: DEFECT (D)**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions, eliminating the "shadow of the future" that sustains conditional cooperation. Defecting becomes the individually rational choice as there's no opportunity for future punishment or reward. This prevents exploitation by other players who will likely also defect in the final round.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   The strategy explicitly defines actions for the first and last rounds, which are the primary edge cases in repeated games.
*   For any `n` players and any `k` where `1 < k < n`, the `k` threshold for conditional cooperation remains valid and scales appropriately.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** It makes the first move towards establishing a cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Promoting Sustainability:** It strives to maintain a high level of collective contributions by rewarding good behavior (`S_prev >= k`) and penalizing poor behavior (`S_prev < k`). The `k` threshold ensures that cooperation is sustained only when it is collectively beneficial enough.
*   **Preventing Exploitation:** While aiming for collective good, it is not naively cooperative. It protects itself from being a "sucker" by defecting when the collective effort is too low, thus discouraging persistent free-riding and pushing the group towards a more equitable and efficient outcome or, failing that, protecting its own resources.
*   **Adaptability:** It dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective actions, making it robust to a wide range of opponent strategies and able to navigate periods of cooperation and defection.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_95 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity," aims to foster cooperation by initiating a trusting gesture and then sustaining collective contributions as long as a significant portion of the group reciprocates. It is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors while protecting against exploitation.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity**

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Gesture):**
    *   In the very first round, I will **Contribute (C)**. This acts as a clear signal of willingness to cooperate and to "test the waters" for collective action.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   After each round `t-1`, I will observe the actions of all other `n-1` players.
    *   I will count the number of other players who **Contributed (C)** in the previous round `t-1`. Let this be `N_other_C`.
    *   **Cooperation Threshold**: My decision to contribute or defect will be based on a collective reciprocity threshold. I will **Contribute (C)** if at least a simple majority of the other players contributed in the previous round.
        *   Specifically, if `N_other_C >= ceil((n-1) / 2)`, I will **Contribute (C)**.
        *   Otherwise (if `N_other_C < ceil((n-1) / 2)`), I will **Defect (D)**.
    *   This threshold implies that I am willing to tolerate up to almost half of the other players defecting without immediately retaliating with my own defection, promoting forgiveness and stability in the collective effort.

*   **Final Round (Round r):**
    *   In the last round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. The game effectively reverts to a single-shot Public Goods Game, where defecting is the individually dominant strategy. To avoid exploitation by rational opponents, I will **Defect (D)** in the final round.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly defined as a contribution to initiate cooperation.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly defined as a defection to prevent exploitation.
*   **Intermediate Rounds:** Covered by the adaptive reciprocity rule.
*   **Small `n` (Number of Players):**
    *   If `n=2`, then `n-1=1`. The threshold `ceil((2-1)/2) = ceil(0.5) = 1`. This means if the other player contributed, I contribute. This simplifies to a standard Tit-for-Tat strategy for two players, which is highly effective.
    *   The strategy gracefully handles `n` as low as 2, as specified by `1 < k < n` implying `n >= 2`.

**3. Collective Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** By contributing in the first round, the strategy signals a willingness to engage in collective action and establishes a potential starting point for mutual cooperation.
*   **Sustains Cooperation through Reciprocity:** The core decision rule encourages ongoing cooperation. It rewards collective contribution (by contributing myself) and responds to widespread defection (by defecting myself).
*   **Forgiveness and Robustness:** The `ceil((n-1)/2)` threshold allows for a degree of forgiveness, tolerating some free-riding without immediately collapsing into full defection. This makes the collective strategy more robust to occasional deviations or "mistakes" by other players, helping to sustain cooperation in imperfect environments.
*   **Protects Against Exploitation:** While aiming for collective welfare, the strategy includes a necessary self-protective mechanism. The defection in the final round and the response to widespread defection in intermediate rounds ensure that the strategy is not indefinitely exploited by purely selfish players in a competitive tournament setting. This balance makes it a viable and pragmatic approach to fostering collective outcomes without being naive.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_96 = '''
Here is a robust and adaptive collective strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to perform well in a tournament against independent AI systems.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocal Contributor (ARC)

**Overview:**
The Adaptive Reciprocal Contributor (ARC) strategy aims to foster and sustain high levels of cooperation throughout the repeated Public Goods Game. It begins by offering cooperation as an olive branch and then dynamically adapts its behavior based on the collective actions observed in the previous round. It uses a specific tolerance threshold to decide when to reciprocate cooperation and when to signal the cost of widespread defection, while pragmatically protecting itself in the final round.

**Key Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `Cooperation_Tolerance_Threshold (CTT)`: This parameter defines the maximum *proportion* of players whose defection we are willing to tolerate in the previous round before we also choose to defect.
    *   **For n = 2 players:** `CTT = 0`. (This means if the *only other player* defects, we will also defect. If they cooperate, we cooperate. This effectively implements a Tit-for-Tat strategy for the 2-player case.)
    *   **For n > 2 players:** `CTT = 1 / n`. (This means we tolerate *at most one* defector among the *other* players in the previous round. If two or more players defected, we will switch to defection ourselves.)

**Decision Rules (for current Round 't'):**

1.  **Round 1:**
    *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** To initiate cooperation and signal a willingness to contribute to the collective good. This is the crucial first step to establish a positive and cooperative environment.

2.  **Rounds 2 to (r-1):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of Round `t`, observe the actions of *all* players (including our own) from the preceding Round `t-1`.
    *   **Calculation:**
        *   Determine `P_d_prev`: The proportion of players who chose to **Defect (D)** in Round `t-1`. This is calculated as `(Number of Defectors in Round t-1) / n`.
    *   **Conditional Decision:**
        *   **If `P_d_prev <= CTT`:**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** The observed level of defection is within our defined tolerance. This indicates that a sufficient number of players are contributing, justifying our continued contribution to reinforce and sustain the collective effort. We are demonstrating a commitment to collective welfare as long as others largely reciprocate.
        *   **If `P_d_prev > CTT`:**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** The level of defection is too high, signaling a significant breakdown in collective cooperation. To avoid exploitation and to signal that widespread free-riding is costly, we switch to defection. This acts as a proportional punishment mechanism, aiming to discourage further non-cooperative behavior and potentially guide players back towards a more cooperative equilibrium.

3.  **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In a finitely repeated game, the final round has no future consequences for reciprocity or punishment. Rational self-interest dictates defection to maximize individual payoff, as any contribution would be exploited by other rational players who are likely to defect. While seemingly contradicting the general collective mindset, this is a pragmatic and robust decision necessary to avoid being a "sucker" in a competitive tournament environment where shared norms and coordination cannot be assumed for the very last interaction. It represents the collectively rational outcome for a single-stage PGG.

**Collective Alignment and Robustness Summary:**
The ARC strategy is aligned with a collective mindset by actively attempting to build and maintain cooperation through its initial contribution and conditional reciprocity. It is **adaptive** as it dynamically responds to the group's observed behavior. It is **robust** by setting a clear, parameter-dependent threshold for tolerance (`CTT`) that protects against sustained exploitation when cooperation levels fall too low. The specific handling of `n=2` players ensures it defaults to a proven robust strategy (Tit-for-Tat) in that scenario. The final round defection is a pragmatic necessity for robust performance in a competitive tournament, acknowledging the fundamental game-theoretic incentives in the absence of future interactions.

### Strategy Description: Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperator (ARC)

This strategy makes decisions based on the current round number and the observed cooperation rate in the previous round.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Play):**
    *   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Begin by signaling a willingness to cooperate and establish a foundation for collective gain. This is an initial attempt to bootstrap cooperation within the group.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`):**
    *   **Observation:** After each round, observe the actions of all `n` players (including yourself) from the immediately preceding round.
    *   **Calculate Cooperation Rate (CR):** Determine the proportion of players who contributed in the previous round.
        `CR = (Number of players who contributed in the previous round) / n`
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `CR >= 0.5` (a majority or more cooperated in the previous round):**
            *   Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** Reward sustained cooperation when the majority is contributing. This reinforces positive collective action and encourages continued group effort for mutual benefit.
        *   **If `CR < 0.5` (a minority cooperated or a majority defected in the previous round):**
            *   Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** Punish widespread defection to protect against exploitation. This signals that cooperation requires collective effort and that one will not be a "sucker" if the group is not pulling its weight.

*   **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of any repeated game, the dominant strategy for a rational player is to defect, as there are no future consequences for their actions. Anticipating this, contributing would almost certainly lead to exploitation. This pragmatic decision ensures robustness and prevents an unnecessary loss of payoff at the game's conclusion.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly defined as contributing (C).
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly defined as defecting (D) to ensure robustness against rational exploitation.
*   **Between First and Last Rounds:** Decisions are dynamically made based on the observed Cooperation Rate, providing adaptability.

**3. Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

The Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperator (ARC) strategy aligns with a collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** It proactively attempts to establish a cooperative equilibrium from the start.
*   **Rewarding Collective Effort:** By reciprocating cooperation when a majority contributes, it actively supports and encourages the maintenance of collective welfare.
*   **Promoting Sustainability:** It provides a clear, transparent mechanism for players to understand when cooperation is expected and when defection will be a response, thereby potentially stabilizing high levels of cooperation among reciprocal agents.

While the strategy includes defection (as a response to non-cooperation and in the final round), this is a necessary feature for robustness in a competitive tournament environment. It seeks to achieve the best collective outcome *given the constraints* that other players might not be cooperative, and there is no coordination. When playing against other strategies that also prioritize collective welfare and reciprocity, ARC will lead to high and sustained cooperation until the endgame, demonstrating its collective effectiveness.

description_COLLECTIVE_98 = '''
The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Reciprocator" (ACR), is designed for the Public Goods Game. It aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation by starting cooperatively, responding to observed behavior with a mix of generosity and punishment, and adapting its endgame play based on the group's historical cooperation.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Reciprocator (ACR)

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: number of players
*   `r`: number of rounds
*   `k`: multiplier (where `1 < k < n`)

**Internal State:**
*   `my_actions_history`: A record of this player's own contributions (1 for C, 0 for D) for each past round.
*   `others_actions_history`: A record of other players' contributions (1 for C, 0 for D) for each past round. This is stored per player.

---

**Decision Rules for Current Round `t`:**

The strategy proceeds through distinct phases depending on the current round `t` relative to the total number of rounds `r`.

1.  **Warm-up & Probe Phase (Rounds 1 and 2, if applicable):**
    *   **If `t == 1` and `r > 1`:**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   *Rationale:* This initial cooperation signals an intent to cooperate and allows for the observation of other players' immediate responses.
    *   **If `t == 2` and `r > 2`:**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   *Rationale:* Provides a second opportunity for cooperation to emerge and helps confirm initial observations of other players' tendencies.

2.  **Endgame Phase (Rounds `r` and `r-1`):**

    *   **If `t == r` (The Very Last Round):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   *Rationale:* In the absence of future interactions, the dominant strategy is to defect. This prevents exploitation by others who will rationally make the same choice.
    *   **If `t == r-1` and `r > 1` (Second to Last Round):**
        *   **Calculate Group Cooperation History:**
            *   For each other player `j`, calculate their individual cooperation rate `P_j_overall` by summing their contributions from Round 1 to Round `t-2` (i.e., `r-3`) and dividing by the number of those rounds (`r-3`).
            *   Let `Avg_P_others_overall` be the average of these `P_j_overall` values across all `n-1` other players. (Note: Since this phase only triggers if `r >= 3`, `t-2` will always be at least 1, so division by zero is not a concern).
        *   **Decision:**
            *   **If `Avg_P_others_overall >= 0.75`** (meaning the group has shown strong historical cooperation up to `r-3`):
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   *Rationale:* A final effort to encourage collective benefit if the group has a proven track record of cooperation, risking a small individual loss for a potentially larger collective gain in the penultimate round.
            *   **Else (If `Avg_P_others_overall < 0.75`):**
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   *Rationale:* Protect against potential exploitation in a group that has not consistently demonstrated strong long-term cooperation.

3.  **Adaptive Reciprocity Phase (All other rounds not covered above):**
    *   This phase applies to rounds `t` from 3 up to `r-2` (if `r > 3`).
    *   **Observe Previous Round's Actions:** Review the contributions of all other players `j != i` in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   Let `num_other_defectors_last_round` be the count of players `j` who contributed `0` (defected) in round `t-1`.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `num_other_defectors_last_round == 0` (All others cooperated in `t-1`):**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   *Rationale:* Reward and reinforce collective cooperation, encouraging its continuation.
        *   **If `0 < num_other_defectors_last_round < (n-1)` (Some others defected in `t-1`):**
            *   **Calculate Defection Proportion:** `defection_proportion = num_other_defectors_last_round / (n-1)`.
            *   **Forgiveness Threshold `F = 0.5`:**
            *   **If `defection_proportion < F`:**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   *Rationale:* Tolerate minor defections (less than 50% of others defecting), demonstrating generosity and giving defectors a chance to re-cooperate. This aligns with the collective goal of maintaining a cooperative equilibrium.
            *   **If `defection_proportion >= F`:**
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   *Rationale:* Respond to significant free-riding to discourage further breakdown of collective action and protect against substantial individual loss.
        *   **If `num_other_defectors_last_round == (n-1)` (All others defected in `t-1`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   *Rationale:* Self-preservation in the face of universal defection from all other players.

---

**Summary of Edge Cases (derived from the rules above):**

*   **`r=1`:** The game goes directly to the Endgame Phase for `t == r`. The player Defects (D).
*   **`r=2`:**
    *   Round 1 (`t=1`): Warm-up & Probe Phase. Player Contributes (C).
    *   Round 2 (`t=r`): Endgame Phase for `t == r`. Player Defects (D).
*   **`r=3`:**
    *   Round 1 (`t=1`): Warm-up & Probe Phase. Player Contributes (C).
    *   Round 2 (`t=r-1`): Endgame Phase for `t == r-1`. Player calculates `Avg_P_others_overall` based on Round 1 only. If `Avg_P_others_overall >= 0.75`, Contribute (C); else, Defect (D).
    *   Round 3 (`t=r`): Endgame Phase for `t == r`. Player Defects (D).

This strategy, named "Adaptive Reciprocal Contributor (ARC)," aims to foster high levels of cooperation within the Public Goods Game, maximizing collective welfare over the long run, while being robust against exploitation by other players. It operates on principles of conditional cooperation and signals an initial willingness to contribute.

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocal Contributor (ARC)

**Objective:** To encourage and maintain a high level of contribution within the group by being conditionally cooperative. This approach seeks to maximize overall collective welfare while remaining resilient and adaptive to diverse behaviors from other tournament participants, preventing sustained exploitation.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution serves as a clear signal of willingness to cooperate and to invest in the public good. It provides other players with an initial positive action to observe, laying the groundwork for potential collective cooperation.

2.  **Subsequent Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`, if `r` is known and finite):**
    *   After each round, observe the total number of contributions made by all players in the *immediately preceding round*, denoted as `sum_j c_j_prev`.
    *   **If `sum_j c_j_prev >= k`:**
        *   **Contribute (C)**.
        *   *Rationale:* If the collective effort (total contributions) in the previous round reached or exceeded the game's multiplier `k`, it indicates a sufficient and viable level of cooperation within the group. Contributing in this scenario reinforces positive behavior, maintains momentum towards the collective good, and demonstrates reciprocity.
    *   **Else (if `sum_j c_j_prev < k`):**
        *   **Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
        *   *Rationale:* If the collective effort fell below the threshold `k`, it signals insufficient cooperation or widespread defection. In this situation, defecting serves as a protective measure to prevent being exploited by free-riders and acts as a clear signal that low contributions are costly to all, potentially prompting other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds to re-establish cooperation.

3.  **Final Round (Round `r`, if `r` is known and finite):**
    *   Always **Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   *Rationale:* In a finite repeated game with a known endpoint, the final round loses the incentive for future reciprocity. Standard game theory suggests that rational players will defect to maximize individual payoff in the last round. To be robust against diverse, potentially self-interested opponent strategies and to avoid exploitation, this strategy adopts the self-protective measure of defecting in the final round, as this action cannot impact future interactions.

**Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by always contributing to initiate cooperation.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by always defecting to ensure robustness against exploitation, assuming `r` is known.
*   **Variable `n` and `k`:** The core decision rule `sum_j c_j_prev >= k` dynamically adjusts the cooperation threshold based on the game's intrinsic multiplier `k`, making it suitable for a wide range of game parameter values.

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**

The Adaptive Reciprocal Contributor strategy embodies a collective mindset by:
*   **Initiating Cooperation:** Starting with a contribution signals a commitment to the public good.
*   **Conditional Support:** It provides sustained support for the public good whenever the group demonstrates a reasonable level of cooperation (defined by the `k` threshold).
*   **Deterring Free-riding:** By defecting when contributions are too low, it indirectly "punishes" free-riding and encourages the group to return to a more beneficial state for all. This mechanism aims to maintain the viability of the public good over time.
*   **Self-Preservation for Sustainability:** While striving for collective welfare, it incorporates self-protective measures (especially in the final round) to ensure the strategy is not systematically exploited, which is crucial for its long-term effectiveness in a competitive environment where not all players may share the same collective goals.

Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity with Forgiveness

This strategy aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game by being responsive to the observed behavior of all players, rewarding collective effort, punishing widespread defection, and offering opportunities for recovery.

**Internal State:**

*   `last_round_met_cooperation_threshold`: A boolean flag, initialized to `true`. This flag tracks whether the collective contribution level in the immediately preceding round met our `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`. Its initial `true` value reflects an initial assumption of collective goodwill, enabling a "forgiveness" mechanism if the first round goes poorly.

**Parameters (derived from general PGG characteristics):**

*   `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD = 0.65`: This is the minimum proportion of players who must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to continue contributing. For example, if there are 10 players (`n=10`), at least 7 contributions (`0.65 * 10 = 6.5`, so 7 or more) are required to signal sufficient collective effort. This threshold balances the need for a meaningful collective contribution with a degree of tolerance for individual defections.
*   `FORGIVENESS_THRESHOLD = 0.25`: This is a lower proportion of contributions that signals a severe breakdown in collective cooperation. If the observed cooperation falls below this level (e.g., fewer than 3 players contribute in a 10-player game), a special "reset" logic is triggered.

**Decision Logic (for each player employing this strategy in `current_round`):**

1.  **Special Case: Single-Round Game (`r = 1`)**
    *   If the total number of rounds `r` is `1`, always defect (D). In a one-shot Public Goods Game, defecting is the individually rational (dominant) strategy.

2.  **Edge Case: First Round (`current_round = 1`, for `r > 1`)**
    *   In the very first round of any multi-round game, always contribute (C). This establishes an initial gesture of trust and signals a willingness to cooperate, setting the stage for collective action.

3.  **Edge Case: Last Round (`current_round = r`, for `r > 1`)**
    *   In the final round `r` of a multi-round game, always defect (D). Standard game theory dictates that cooperation unravels through backward induction in the last round, making defection the rational choice.

4.  **Main Logic: Intermediate Rounds (`current_round` between `2` and `r-1`, for `r > 1`)**
    *   First, observe and calculate the collective behavior from the immediately preceding round (`current_round - 1`):
        *   Let `C_prev_round` be the total number of players who contributed in the previous round.
        *   Calculate `P_coop_prev = C_prev_round / n`, which is the proportion of cooperators.

    *   **Rule A: Sustained Collective Cooperation**
        *   If `P_coop_prev >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C). The collective has demonstrated sufficient commitment; we reciprocate by continuing our contribution.
            *   **State Update:** Set `last_round_met_cooperation_threshold = true`.

    *   **Rule B: Insufficient Collective Cooperation (Punishment Phase)**
        *   If `FORGIVENESS_THRESHOLD <= P_coop_prev < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
            *   **Action:** Defect (D). The observed collective contribution level is below our expected threshold; we signal our dissatisfaction and encourage greater collective effort by withholding our contribution.
            *   **State Update:** Set `last_round_met_cooperation_threshold = false`.

    *   **Rule C: Widespread Defection (Attempted Reset or Continued Defection)**
        *   If `P_coop_prev < FORGIVENESS_THRESHOLD`:
            *   This signifies a severe breakdown in cooperation. We decide our action based on the recent history:
                *   **If `last_round_met_cooperation_threshold` was `true`** (meaning the system recently experienced a drastic collapse from an acceptable level of cooperation):
                    *   **Action:** Contribute (C). This is a one-time "generous" move, an attempt to "re-seed" cooperation and prevent a permanent defection spiral, assuming others might also be willing to restart.
                *   **Else (`last_round_met_cooperation_threshold` was `false`** – indicating that the collective has been uncooperative at a very low level for multiple rounds):
                    *   **Action:** Defect (D). In this scenario, continued contribution would be naive and exploitable; the collective has not shown a sustained effort to recover.
            *   **State Update:** Set `last_round_met_cooperation_threshold = false`.

---

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by:

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** It initiates play with a contribution, signaling a willingness to contribute to the public good.
*   **Reciprocity:** It consistently contributes when the collective demonstrates sufficient cooperation, rewarding good behavior.
*   **Conditional Punishment:** It defects when the collective contribution falls short, acting as a "punisher" to encourage others to increase their contributions for mutual benefit.
*   **Forgiveness and Resilience:** It includes a mechanism (Rule C) to attempt to restart cooperation after a severe breakdown, demonstrating a persistent, yet not naive, desire for the collective good, even in adverse conditions.
*   **Adaptability:** Its rules are entirely dependent on observed past actions of all players, allowing it to adapt to various opponent behaviors.
*   **Robustness:** By avoiding unconditional cooperation and incorporating punishment and reset mechanisms, it aims to prevent exploitation while still striving for an optimal collective outcome.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperator (ARC)

This strategy is designed to foster and maintain cooperation in the Public Goods Game by initiating trust, monitoring the collective level of contribution, and adaptively responding to ensure a fair and mutually beneficial outcome, while also protecting itself from exploitation. It aims to achieve the higher collective welfare derived from widespread cooperation.

---

**1. Decision Rules**

**Round 1 (Initial Interaction):**
*   **Action:** Contribute (C).
*   **Rationale:** To signal a willingness to cooperate and to attempt to establish a cooperative equilibrium from the outset. This aligns with the collective mindset of trying to achieve the highest possible group payoff.

**Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
*   **Observation:** At the start of each intermediate round, the strategy observes the actions of all `n` players in the *immediately preceding round*.
*   **Calculation:** Determine the `Proportion_Contributed` in the last round: `P_contributed = (Total contributions in previous round) / n`.
*   **Dynamic Cooperation Threshold (T):** The strategy uses a dynamically calculated threshold to decide its action. This threshold adapts to the game parameters `k` and `n`, reflecting how easy or difficult it is to sustain cooperation in the given game.
    *   `T = (1 + k/n) / 2`
    *   *Rationale:* This threshold averages the ideal (100% cooperation) with `k/n` (the individual share of benefit from each contributed token).
        *   When `k/n` is high (i.e., the individual benefit from the public good is high relative to the cost), the threshold `T` will be higher, meaning the strategy expects a higher level of collective cooperation.
        *   When `k/n` is low (i.e., the individual benefit is low), `T` will be lower, reflecting a more challenging environment for cooperation and being more tolerant of slightly lower collective contribution levels, while still aiming for a significant majority.
*   **Decision:**
    *   If `P_contributed >= T`: **Contribute (C).**
        *   *Rationale:* The collective has demonstrated a sufficiently high level of cooperation. The strategy rewards this by continuing to contribute, aiming to sustain mutual cooperation and high collective payoffs.
    *   If `P_contributed < T`: **Defect (D).**
        *   *Rationale:* The collective contribution level fell below the expected threshold. This indicates a potential for free-riding or a breakdown of cooperation. The strategy retaliates by defecting to discourage further free-riding and to encourage a return to higher collective contribution levels in subsequent rounds. This acts as a punishment mechanism, but with inherent forgiveness as the strategy will revert to cooperation if `P_contributed` rises above `T` again.

**Last Round (Round r):**
*   **Action:** Defect (D).
*   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. The dominant strategy for any rational player in a single-shot game (which the last round effectively becomes) is to defect. Contributing would be individually irrational and would make the player vulnerable to exploitation by others.

---

**2. Handling Edge Cases**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly defined as Contribute (C) to initiate trust.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly defined as Defect (D) due to the endgame effect.
*   **Intermediate Rounds:** The dynamic threshold and observation of `P_contributed` handles all scenarios between the first and last round, adapting to observed collective behavior.

---

**3. Collective Alignment**

This strategy is built on a collective mindset:
*   It **initiates cooperation** to foster the highest collective outcome.
*   It **monitors the *collective* contribution level** (`P_contributed`), rather than just individual actions, making it robust in `n`-player settings.
*   It **rewards collective cooperation** by continuing to contribute, sustaining the public good.
*   It **punishes insufficient collective cooperation** to discourage free-riding and motivate a return to higher contribution levels, which ultimately benefits the group in the long run.
*   The dynamic threshold `T = (1 + k/n) / 2` ensures the strategy's expectations for cooperation are realistically aligned with the inherent incentives of the specific game parameters (`k` and `n`), promoting sustainability.

The Adaptive Reciprocal Cooperator (ARC) strategy balances the desire for collective benefit with the need for self-protection in a competitive environment, aiming for robust and adaptive cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_102 = '''
This strategy is designed to promote and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game by combining initial trust, conditional reciprocity, and a forgiving punishment mechanism. It aims to be robust against various opponent strategies while pushing for collective welfare.

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Reciprocity with Forgiveness (ARF)**

**Internal State Variables:**
*   `punishment_mode_active`: A boolean, initialized to `false`. Indicates if the strategy is currently in a punishment phase.
*   `punishment_rounds_remaining`: An integer, initialized to `0`. Counts down the number of rounds left in a punishment phase.

**Decision Rules (per round):**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Move):**
    *   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Start cooperatively to signal willingness to contribute and to attempt to establish a high level of cooperation from the outset.

2.  **Last Round (`current_round == r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, the dominant strategy is to defect (backward induction). This maximizes individual payoff when there are no future consequences.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < current_round < r`):**
    *   Let `previous_total_contributions` be the sum of contributions from all `n` players in the *previous* round.

    *   **If `punishment_mode_active` is true:**
        *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
        *   **Action:** Decrement `punishment_rounds_remaining`.
        *   **Transition:** If `punishment_rounds_remaining` becomes `0`, set `punishment_mode_active = false`.
        *   **Rationale:** Continue the predefined punishment phase to discourage non-cooperative behavior. The `punishment_mode_active = false` transition prepares for a return to conditional cooperation in the *next* round.

    *   **If `punishment_mode_active` is false:**
        *   Define a **Cooperation Threshold (T):** `T = max(2, floor(n / 2) + 1)`.
            *   *Explanation:* This threshold means that at least a strict majority of players (more than half) must have contributed in the previous round for us to continue cooperating. For `n=2`, `T` becomes `2`, meaning both players must have contributed.
        *   **Check previous round's cooperation:**
            *   **If `previous_total_contributions >= T`:**
                *   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** Reward the group for maintaining a sufficiently high level of cooperation by continuing to contribute.
            *   **If `previous_total_contributions < T`:**
                *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
                *   **Action:** Set `punishment_mode_active = true`.
                *   **Action:** Set `punishment_rounds_remaining = 2`.
                *   **Rationale:** Initiate a punishment phase (for 2 rounds) to penalize the group for failing to meet the minimum cooperation threshold. This signals that significant defection is not tolerated, but the punishment is temporary to allow for future re-establishment of cooperation.

**Summary of Collective Mindset & Robustness:**

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** Starts with a contribution to encourage an initial cooperative equilibrium.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** Adapts behavior based on the observed collective contribution level, rewarding high cooperation and punishing low cooperation.
*   **Forgiveness:** Employs a fixed, limited punishment phase (2 rounds) rather than a permanent "grim trigger" defection. This allows the strategy to recover from temporary dips in cooperation and re-establish a cooperative equilibrium, which is crucial for achieving high collective payoffs over many rounds. This makes it robust against occasional, non-strategic defections or exploratory behaviors from other players.
*   **Strategic End-Game:** Recognizes the finite nature of the game by defecting in the last round, a standard rational move to maximize individual payoff in the absence of future interactions.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The dynamic `T` (Cooperation Threshold) ensures that the strategy demands a reasonable level of collective effort, adjusting based on the number of players. For small groups (`n=2,3`), it's quite strict (demanding nearly full cooperation), while for larger groups, it allows for a few defections without triggering punishment.

description_COLLECTIVE_103 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective PGG (AC-PGG)**, is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation while being robust against various opponent behaviors and recognizing the game's structural incentives. It aims for high collective welfare by initiating cooperation and adaptively responding to the group's contribution levels, including a rational approach to the end-game.

---

**Adaptive Collective PGG (AC-PGG) Strategy Description**

This strategy relies on observing past group behavior to determine its current action. It will adapt its level of cooperation based on how well the group is contributing to the public good.

**Game Parameters Utilized:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (where `1 < k < n`).
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.

**Internal Threshold Calculation:**
The strategy uses a dynamic cooperation threshold, `T_cooperate`, which is derived from the game parameters to balance collective benefit and individual rationality.

*   **`T_cooperate = max(0.5, 1/k)`**
    *   This threshold dictates the minimum proportion of players who must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to contribute in the current round.
    *   `1/k`: Represents the minimum proportion of cooperators needed for the average return on contribution to be at least 1 (covering the individual cost). If `k` is small (meaning low collective efficiency), this threshold will be high, requiring more cooperation to justify contributing.
    *   `0.5`: Ensures that even when `k` is very large (high collective efficiency), at least half of the players must contribute to signal a strong commitment to the public good.

**Decision Rules (Action in Round `t`):**

The decision rules are conditional on the current round number (`t`) and the observed actions from the previous round (`t-1`).

1.  **Round 1: Initial Trust and Signal of Intent**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Reasoning:** Begin by demonstrating a willingness to cooperate, attempting to initiate a cooperative equilibrium within the group. This sets a positive precedent.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1`: Adaptive Cooperation Phase**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t`, observe the contributions made by all players in the preceding round `t-1`.
    *   **Calculation:**
        *   Count the number of players who contributed in round `t-1`. Let this be `N_C(t-1)`.
        *   Calculate the observed cooperation rate for round `t-1`: `P_C(t-1) = N_C(t-1) / n`.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `P_C(t-1) >= T_cooperate`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Reasoning:** The group demonstrated sufficient cooperation in the previous round, indicating a collective commitment to the public good. This strategy reinforces that positive behavior by continuing to contribute.
        *   **Else (`P_C(t-1) < T_cooperate`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reasoning:** The group's cooperation level fell below the acceptable threshold. This strategy will defect as a signal of dissatisfaction, aiming to punish free-riding and incentivize a return to higher collective contributions in future rounds.

3.  **Round `r`: End Game Rationality**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round of a finitely repeated game, the dominant strategy for any rational player is to defect, as there are no future consequences to actions. Cooperating in this round would leave the player vulnerable to exploitation. This strategy recognizes this game-theoretic reality to avoid being a "sucker."

**Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **One-Shot Game (`r=1`):** If the game consists of only one round, the strategy will immediately move to the "Round `r`" rule and defect (D). This is the individually rational choice for a standard one-shot Public Goods Game.
*   **Persistent Defection:** If the group consistently fails to meet `T_cooperate`, this strategy will repeatedly defect after the first round, preventing exploitation.
*   **Consistent Cooperation:** If the group consistently cooperates above `T_cooperate`, this strategy will consistently cooperate (until the final round), leading to high collective welfare.

'''

description_COLLECTIVE_104 = '''
This strategy is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation while protecting against persistent exploitation, adapting to the observed behavior of the group.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Engagement (ACE)**

**Core Principles:**
*   **Initiate Cooperation:** Start with a cooperative gesture to signal willingness to build collective welfare.
*   **Conditional Reciprocity:** Reward widespread cooperation and sanction widespread defection among peers.
*   **Protect Against Exploitation:** Avoid being a "sucker" to consistent free-riders, especially in the endgame.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution serves as an unambiguous signal of a desire to cooperate and attempts to establish a positive precedent for the collective good. It's an investment in potentially higher payoffs for everyone.

2.  **Middle Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   **Observation:** At the start of each middle round, observe the actions of all *other* players in the immediately preceding round (Round t-1).
    *   **Calculation:** Determine the proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round.
        *   Let `N_C_others_prev` be the number of other players who contributed in Round t-1.
        *   Calculate `P_C_others_prev = N_C_others_prev / (n-1)`.
    *   **Action Decision:**
        *   **If `P_C_others_prev >= 0.5` (i.e., at least half of the other players contributed in the previous round):**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   *Rationale:* This rewards a significant level of collective effort and signals a continued willingness to cooperate when the majority of peers are also contributing. It aims to sustain the cooperative equilibrium.
        *   **Else (i.e., `P_C_others_prev < 0.5`, meaning fewer than half of the other players contributed in the previous round):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* This acts as a collective sanction against widespread defection. It protects against being overly exploited and attempts to encourage a return to cooperation by showing that free-riding will not be tolerated indefinitely without consequences.

3.  **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* Due to the finite nature of the game and the absence of future interactions, the incentive to cooperate vanishes in the final round. Defecting prevents exploitation by other players who, by backward induction, are also expected to defect. This is a robust, self-protective measure in the face of the game's structure.

---

**Handling Edge Cases:**
*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by contributing (C).
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by defecting (D).
*   **Small `n` (e.g., n=2):** The `P_C_others_prev >= 0.5` rule adapts correctly. For n=2, `n-1=1`. If the other player contributed (`P_C_others_prev = 1/1 = 1`), then contribute. If the other player defected (`P_C_others_prev = 0/1 = 0`), then defect. This effectively becomes a Tit-for-Tat strategy for n=2, which is highly effective.

**Collective Alignment:**
This strategy prioritizes the establishment and maintenance of collective welfare by:
*   Initiating cooperation.
*   Sustaining cooperation when a critical mass of players also cooperates.
*   Responding to widespread defection in a way that discourages continued free-riding and encourages a return to collective contribution, thereby maximizing potential group payoffs over time.
*   While pragmatic in the last round, its overall design promotes a cooperative ecosystem throughout the bulk of the game.

description_COLLECTIVE_105 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**, aims to establish and maintain a high level of cooperation by being conditionally cooperative, adapting to the observed behavior of other players, and protecting against persistent free-riding. It is designed to foster collective welfare in a non-cooperative environment.

---

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**

**Core Principle:** ACR endeavors to initiate and sustain a cooperative equilibrium. It demonstrates an initial willingness to contribute, then reciprocates the observed cooperation levels from others, and strategically defects in the final round to prevent exploitation.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (t=1): Initial Trust**
    *   **Action:** **CONTRIBUTE (C)**
    *   **Rationale:** Begin by contributing to signal a willingness to cooperate and to provide an opportunity for the group to establish a cooperative norm. This sets a positive precedent.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r): Conditional Reciprocity**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t`, observe the actions of all players (excluding yourself) from the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculation:** Determine the **Proportion of Other Cooperators (P_coop)** for the previous round:
        `P_coop_{t-1} = (Sum of contributions from all players EXCEPT self in round t-1) / (n - 1)`
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   **If `P_coop_{t-1} >= 0.5` (i.e., 50% or more of the *other* players contributed):**
            *   **Action:** **CONTRIBUTE (C)**
            *   **Rationale:** Continue contributing. This reinforces positive collective behavior and rewards cooperation from the majority of the group, sustaining the cooperative equilibrium.
        *   **Else (If `P_coop_{t-1} < 0.5`, meaning less than 50% of the *other* players contributed):**
            *   **Action:** **DEFECT (D)**
            *   **Rationale:** Defect to protect against exploitation. A significant drop in cooperation from others signals free-riding or a breakdown of cooperation, requiring a defensive response to avoid being a "sucker." This also serves as a signal to encourage others to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds.

3.  **Last Round (t=r): End-Game Rationality**
    *   **Action:** **DEFECT (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finitely repeated game, there are no future rounds to incentivize reciprocal cooperation. Backward induction dictates that individual rationality leads to defection, as contributing offers no future benefits and only incurs a cost. This action prevents exploitation in the final stage.

---

**Alignment with Collective Mindset and Robustness:**

*   **Fosters Cooperation:** By initiating cooperation and reciprocating a majority of cooperative actions, ACR actively attempts to build and maintain a high level of collective contribution. If all players adopt this strategy, it leads to full cooperation for `r-1` rounds, maximizing the collective payoff.
*   **Adaptive:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective contribution level, rather than adhering to a rigid rule.
*   **Robust to Free-Riding:** The `P_coop < 0.5` threshold for defection acts as a built-in punishment mechanism, preventing persistent exploitation by defectors and incentivizing non-cooperators to contribute more.
*   **Simple and Interpretable:** The rules are straightforward, making it potentially easier for other adaptive strategies to implicitly "understand" ACR's behavior and respond in kind, contributing to stability.
*   **Handles Edge Cases:** Explicit rules for the first and last rounds ensure appropriate behavior at critical junctures of the game.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_106 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Reciprocity with End-Game Defection," is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize long-term collective welfare by initiating cooperation, rewarding sufficient group contributions, and punishing widespread defection, while remaining robust to various opponent behaviors.

---

### Strategy: Adaptive Reciprocity with End-Game Defection

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **For Round 1 (Initial Round):**
    *   **Contribute (C).**
    *   *Rationale:* To proactively signal a willingness to contribute to the public good and to explore the potential for collective cooperation within the group. This provides an initial opportunity for collective welfare to emerge and gathers crucial data on how other players respond.

*   **For Rounds 2 through r-1 (Intermediate Rounds):**
    *   **Observe Past Behavior:** After each round `t-1`, observe `S_prev`, which is the total number of players who contributed (i.e., `sum_j c_j_prev`) in that previous round.
    *   **Determine Cooperation Threshold:** Calculate `Threshold_Cooperators = ceil(n / k)`. This value represents the minimum number of contributors required for the collective project to demonstrate sufficient viability and collective effort.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `S_prev >= Threshold_Cooperators`: **Contribute (C).**
            *   *Rationale:* A sufficient number of players contributed in the previous round, indicating that the group is making a meaningful collective effort. This strategy rewards and reinforces such cooperation to sustain the collective good, even if an immediate individual defection might offer a slightly higher personal payoff in that specific round. The goal is to maintain the conditions for ongoing collective benefit.
        *   Else (if `S_prev < Threshold_Cooperators`): **Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* If the number of cooperators falls below the critical threshold, it signals insufficient collective effort. This strategy defects to avoid exploitation, to conserve resources, and to signal to the group that a higher level of cooperation is required to justify continued personal investment in the public good.

*   **For Round r (Final Round):**
    *   **Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round of a finite repeated game, the mechanism of future interactions and reputation building ceases to exist. Game theory dictates that individual self-interest will lead all rational players to defect, as there are no subsequent rounds to incentivize cooperation. This strategy anticipates this backward induction outcome to prevent exploitation.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (Round 1):** Explicitly defined as always contributing (C) to initiate cooperation and test the group's willingness.
*   **Last Round (Round r):** Explicitly defined as always defecting (D), based on the principles of backward induction in finite repeated games.
*   **Intermediate Rounds (2 to r-1):** The adaptive threshold mechanism `S_prev >= ceil(n / k)` provides a dynamic response to varying levels of cooperation. It allows the strategy to gracefully handle scenarios ranging from unanimous defection (leading to continued defection) to unanimous cooperation (leading to continued cooperation), and all situations in between.

**3. Collective Mindset:**

*   This strategy inherently embodies a collective mindset by proactively attempting to foster and sustain cooperation from the very first round. Its primary objective is to facilitate the emergence and maintenance of a high level of contributions, thereby maximizing the total collective payoff (`k` per player if all cooperate).
*   The `ceil(n / k)` threshold is carefully chosen to represent a critical mass: it is not so strict as to punish minor deviations and collapse cooperation unnecessarily, but it is firm enough to prevent pervasive free-riding that would undermine the collective good. It defines a minimal viable level of collective contribution where the public project remains a worthwhile endeavor, ensuring the strategy does not become an unconditional altruist susceptible to indefinite exploitation.
*   While the strategy might occasionally make a decision to cooperate that is not immediately individually optimal in a given round (e.g., contributing when defecting would yield a slightly higher immediate payoff), it does so strategically with the overarching goal of nurturing a cooperative environment that leads to significantly higher collective and individual payoffs in the long run.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_107 = '''
**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Cooperation (ACC)**

**Core Principle:** The Adaptive Collective Cooperation (ACC) strategy aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation throughout the Public Goods Game. It is designed to be initially cooperative, but dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed overall level of cooperation in the group from the previous round. It incorporates a collective "punishment" mechanism to discourage widespread free-riding and accounts for the strategic implications of the game's final rounds.

**Game Parameters Utilized:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n)

**Internal Parameters:**
*   `cooperation_threshold_ratio`: Set to **0.5**. This critical threshold determines what constitutes an acceptable level of group cooperation. If the proportion of contributing players in the previous round falls below this ratio, the strategy will defect.
*   `end_game_horizon`: Set to **1 round**. This indicates that only the very last round of the game is treated as an "end game" scenario where cooperation incentives diminish.

---

**Decision Rules (for the current round `t`):**

1.  **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
    *   **Rationale:** As a collective-minded strategy, ACC initiates cooperation to signal its willingness to contribute and to probe the group's general propensity for cooperation. This sets the stage for potential collective benefit.

2.  **End Game Round (t = r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D)
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, the "shadow of the future" disappears, removing the incentive for future cooperation. Rational players will foresee this and defect. To avoid being exploited in this predictable scenario, ACC defects in the last round.

3.  **Middle Rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   **Observation:** At the conclusion of round `t-1`, ACC observes the actions of all players. It calculates `S_prev = sum_j c_j_prev`, which is the total number of players who contributed in the previous round.
    *   **Calculation:** Determine the `observed_cooperation_ratio = S_prev / n`.
    *   **Conditional Action:**
        *   **IF `observed_cooperation_ratio >= cooperation_threshold_ratio`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
            *   **Rationale:** The group has maintained an acceptable or high level of cooperation. ACC continues to contribute to reinforce this positive collective behavior, sustain the cooperative equilibrium, and work towards maximizing overall group payoff.
        *   **ELSE (`observed_cooperation_ratio < cooperation_threshold_ratio`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D)
            *   **Rationale:** The group's cooperation level has dropped below the defined threshold, indicating a significant number of free-riders or a breakdown in collective effort. ACC responds by defecting to protect itself from exploitation and to signal that a low level of collective contribution is not tolerated. This acts as a collective "punishment" mechanism, aiming to encourage a return to higher cooperation in subsequent rounds.

---

**Summary of Strategic Behavior:**

ACC starts by extending an offer of cooperation. It then monitors the group's collective action, rewarding sufficient cooperation with continued contributions and responding to widespread defection with its own defection. This approach makes the strategy adaptive to the specific dynamics of the player group and robust against persistent free-riding. By incorporating an end-game defection, it also protects against predictable exploitation when future interactions cease to matter. This strategy strives to achieve the highest possible collective welfare while maintaining a realistic defense against non-cooperative behaviors.

The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (with Peer-Based Threshold)", is designed for the repeated Public Goods Game to foster and sustain collective cooperation while remaining robust against exploitation. It adapts its behavior based on the observed actions of other players, aiming for a high collective payoff.

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (with Peer-Based Threshold)

This strategy balances the desire for collective welfare with protection against individual exploitation, adapting to the group's behavior over time. It recognizes that sustaining cooperation requires mutual effort and will adjust its actions accordingly.

**1. First Round (t=1): Initial Cooperative Stance**

*   Always **Contribute (C)**.
*   *Rationale:* This action serves as an initial signal of willingness to initiate and foster a cooperative environment within the group, inviting others to reciprocate.

**2. Mid-Game Play (Rounds 2 to `r-1`): Adaptive Peer-Based Cooperation**

*   At the beginning of each round `t`, the strategy will observe the actions of all players from the immediately preceding round `t-1`.
*   Calculate `N_C_others(t-1)`, which is the count of players *other than yourself* who contributed (C) in round `t-1`.
*   **Decision Rule:**
    *   If `N_C_others(t-1)` is greater than or equal to `ceil((n-1) / 2)`:
        *   **Contribute (C)**.
        *   *Rationale:* If at least half of the other players demonstrated a willingness to contribute, it indicates a sufficient level of collective effort. The strategy reciprocates this cooperation to sustain the cooperative equilibrium and achieve higher collective payoffs.
    *   Otherwise (if `N_C_others(t-1)` is less than `ceil((n-1) / 2)`):
        *   **Defect (D)**.
        *   *Rationale:* If fewer than half of the other players contributed, it signals a significant breakdown in collective cooperation or an attempt at widespread free-riding. The strategy defects to protect itself from being a "sucker" and to signal that broader participation is required for continued cooperation. This acts as a collective punishment mechanism.

**3. Final Round Play (Round `r`): Rational End-Game Defection**

*   Always **Defect (D)**.
*   *Rationale:* In the final round of a finitely repeated game, there are no future interactions or opportunities for reputation building. Individual rationality dictates defection, as there are no consequences for free-riding. This prevents exploitation by other players who will also rationally defect in the absence of future incentives.

---

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy aligns with a collective mindset by:

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** It proactively starts with a contribution to encourage a positive collective dynamic.
*   **Sustaining Collective Welfare:** It continues to cooperate when a substantial portion of its peers (at least half) demonstrates cooperation, actively working towards the higher collective payoff that `k > 1` enables.
*   **Promoting Reciprocity:** By conditioning its cooperation on the actions of others, it encourages widespread contribution and discourages free-riding, which is essential for collective success.
*   **Protecting Against Exploitation:** It shifts to defection when collective cooperation weakens, preventing individual exploitation and signaling that sustained cooperation requires mutual effort. This mechanism implicitly encourages players to return to more cooperative behavior.
*   **Game-Theoretic Rationality:** It recognizes the inherent limitations of cooperation in finitely repeated games by defecting in the final round, avoiding naive altruism and ensuring a robust performance.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_109 = '''
This strategy is designed to be adaptive and robust, balancing the individual incentive to defect with the collective benefit of cooperation. It leverages past observations to infer the collective intent of the group and adjusts its behavior accordingly, with a sensitivity to the public good's efficiency (`k`).

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive k-Threshold Reciprocity

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: number of players
*   `r`: number of rounds
*   `k`: multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Internal State:** None beyond game history.

---

**Decision Rules:**

**1. First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Begin with an optimistic attempt at cooperation to signal willingness and explore the collective's initial behavior. This is a common starting point for reciprocal strategies.

**2. Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. The individually rational and dominant strategy is to defect to maximize immediate personal gain.

**3. Intermediate Rounds (Round `t` where 1 < `t` < `r`):**
    *   **Information Gathering:**
        *   Observe `C_prev`: The total number of contributions made by all players in the previous round (`t-1`). This is `sum_j c_j` from round `t-1`.

    *   **Calculate Cooperation Threshold (T):**
        `T = max(1, n - floor(k))`

        *   **Rationale for `T`:** This dynamic threshold adapts to the efficiency of the public good (`k`).
            *   **If `k` is small (inefficient public good):** `floor(k)` will be small. Consequently, `n - floor(k)` will be large, meaning `T` will be high. This implies the strategy requires a high number of cooperators (`C_prev` must be large) to continue contributing. This protects against exploitation when individual contributions have a low collective return.
            *   **If `k` is large (efficient public good):** `floor(k)` will be large (closer to `n`). Consequently, `n - floor(k)` will be small, meaning `T` will be low. This implies the strategy is more forgiving and requires a lower number of cooperators (`C_prev` can be small) to continue contributing. This encourages and sustains cooperation when the collective benefit is high, even if some players defect.
            *   `max(1, ...)` ensures that `T` is always at least 1. This means the strategy will always require at least one contribution from the group in the previous round to consider cooperating itself, preventing it from being the sole cooperator with no prior support.

    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   If `C_prev >= T`: **Contribute (C).**
            *   **Rationale:** The observed level of collective cooperation in the previous round meets or exceeds the strategy's adaptive threshold for continued engagement. This signals a willingness to maintain cooperation.
        *   If `C_prev < T`: **Defect (D).**
            *   **Rationale:** The observed level of collective cooperation falls below the adaptive threshold. This indicates insufficient collective effort, prompting the strategy to defect as a protective measure against exploitation and as a signal to encourage greater future cooperation.

---

**Collective Alignment and Robustness:**

*   **Collective Mindset:** The strategy aims to foster and sustain high levels of cooperation by being reciprocal. Its `k`-dependent threshold strategically supports the public good: it is more forgiving when the public good is highly efficient (high `k`, where collective action yields substantial benefits) and stricter when it is less efficient (low `k`, where contributions are less impactful and free-riding is more costly to the collective).
*   **Adaptive and Robust:** By dynamically adjusting its threshold `T` based on `k`, the strategy is inherently adaptive to the game's core parameters. Its reliance on `C_prev` makes it adaptive to observed opponent behaviors. It avoids being an unconditional cooperator (sucker) or an always-defector, offering a balanced approach that can lead to cooperation in a receptive environment while protecting itself in a hostile one.
*   **Tournament Readiness:** This strategy is designed to perform well in a tournament by promoting cooperation when possible, but quickly retaliating against sustained defection. The specific tuning of `T` based on `k` provides a nuanced and effective response across a wide range of PGG environments without requiring explicit coordination.

Here is a strategic description for the Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive, robust, and aligned with collective welfare in a tournament setting.

---

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Steward**

This strategy aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation within the group. It balances the ambition for high collective payoffs with a pragmatic need to avoid exploitation, adapting its behavior based on the observed willingness of the group to contribute to the public good.

**Decision Rules:**

This strategy determines its action (Contribute 'C' or Defect 'D') for each round based on the game's parameters, the current round number, and the observed history of contributions.

1.  **Special Case: Single Round Game (r = 1)**
    *   If the game consists of only one round (`r = 1`), always **Defect (D)**.
        *   *Rationale:* In a single-round Public Goods Game, defection is the dominant strategy due to the absence of future interactions to incentivize cooperation.

2.  **Standard Game (r > 1):**

    *   **Round 1: Initial Outreach**
        *   Always **Contribute (C)**.
        *   *Rationale:* This acts as an initial signal of willingness to cooperate and provides an opportunity for others to demonstrate their cooperative intent. It's a "kind" opening move designed to seed collective benefit and explore the potential for a high-payoff cooperative equilibrium.

    *   **Rounds 2 to r-1: Adaptive Response**
        *   **Observe Previous Round's Collective Effort:**
            At the beginning of round `t` (where `2 <= t <= r-1`), observe `C_prev`, which is the total number of contributions made by *all* players (including self) in the immediately preceding round `(t-1)`.
            Calculate the `group_cooperation_rate = C_prev / n`.
        *   **Dynamic Cooperation Threshold:**
            Determine the `Cooperation_Threshold` based on the number of players `n`. This threshold represents the minimum `group_cooperation_rate` required to maintain cooperation.
            *   Calculate `tolerated_defectors = max(1, floor(n / 4))`. This means we tolerate at least one defector, and for larger groups, up to 25% of players defecting.
            *   `Cooperation_Threshold = (n - tolerated_defectors) / n`.
        *   **Conditional Decision:**
            *   If `group_cooperation_rate >= Cooperation_Threshold`: **Contribute (C)**.
                *   *Rationale:* If the group's cooperation rate meets or exceeds the threshold, it signals a sufficient level of collective engagement. This strategy reciprocates that cooperation, reinforcing the positive feedback loop and striving for maximum collective payoff.
            *   Else (`group_cooperation_rate < Cooperation_Threshold`): **Defect (D)**.
                *   *Rationale:* If the group's cooperation rate falls below the dynamic threshold, it indicates a significant lack of collective effort or a tendency towards exploitation. This strategy responds by defecting to protect its own endowment and to signal that widespread defection will be met with non-cooperation, attempting to nudge the group back towards the cooperation threshold.

    *   **Round r: Final Round Deterioration**
        *   Always **Defect (D)**.
        *   *Rationale:* In the very last round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. Based on the principle of backward induction, individual rationality dictates defection as the dominant strategy, as there's no consequence for future exploitation.

**Key Parameters & Calculations:**

*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `C_prev`: Total contributions from *all players* in the previous round.
*   `group_cooperation_rate = C_prev / n`.
*   `tolerated_defectors = max(1, floor(n / 4))`.
*   `Cooperation_Threshold = (n - tolerated_defectors) / n`.

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**

The "Adaptive Collective Steward" strategy is designed to achieve the highest possible collective welfare by strategically encouraging and maintaining cooperation. It opens with a cooperative gesture to establish a positive precedent and then dynamically adapts to the group's behavior, rewarding high cooperation and punishing widespread defection. While safeguarding against individual exploitation, its core mechanism aims to steer the collective towards the mutually beneficial cooperative equilibrium, acting as a steward for the public good in a non-cooperative environment. It's adaptive to group dynamics and robust against varying levels of selfishness, making it suitable for a tournament against independent strategies.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_111 = '''
The following strategy, named "Adaptive Proportional Reciprocity (APR)," is designed to foster and maintain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game while being robust against exploitation and adaptable to varying group sizes. It balances an initial cooperative stance with conditional responses to defection, aiming for the highest possible collective welfare within the tournament context.

---

### Adaptive Proportional Reciprocity (APR) Strategy

**Overview:**
This strategy aims to establish a cooperative equilibrium by starting cooperatively, being forgiving of minor defections in larger groups, but firm against widespread free-riding or single defections in small groups. It leverages observation of past actions to adapt its behavior.

**1. Decision Rules - When do you Cooperate vs. Defect?**

*   **Round 1: Initiate Cooperation**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** Start by signaling a willingness to cooperate and contribute to the collective good. This sets a positive precedent and provides an opportunity for all players to establish a high level of cooperation.

*   **Rounds 2 to `r-1`: Adaptive Phase**
    *   **Observation:** After each round `t-1`, observe the actions of all `n` players. Count the total number of players who **defected** in round `t-1`. Let this be `D_{t-1}`.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        1.  **If `D_{t-1} == 0` (Full Cooperation):**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If everyone contributed in the previous round, the collective is achieving its optimal outcome. Continue to contribute to maintain this state.
        2.  **If `D_{t-1} == 1` (One Defector):**
            *   **Action:**
                *   If `n > 2`: **Contribute (C)**.
                *   If `n == 2`: **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:**
                *   For groups larger than two players (`n > 2`), we are forgiving of a single defector. This is a crucial aspect of promoting robust cooperation, as it prevents a single deviation (which could be a test, a mistake, or an agent following a different strategy) from immediately collapsing the cooperative effort. It signals a strong commitment to collective welfare, allowing for resilience against minor perturbations.
                *   For a two-player game (`n == 2`), one defector means the *only other player* defected. In this specific scenario, continuing to contribute would be pure exploitation. Therefore, for `n=2`, this strategy reverts to a standard Tit-for-Tat approach by defecting in response.
        3.  **If `D_{t-1} >= 2` (Two or More Defectors):**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If two or more players defected, the level of free-riding is significant, undermining the collective good. This strategy responds by defecting, which reduces the total contributions for everyone. This acts as a punishment mechanism to discourage widespread defection and signals that a high level of cooperation is required for collective benefit.

**2. Handle Edge Cases**

*   **First Round (`r=1`):** As specified above, always **Contribute (C)**.
*   **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions for which cooperation could be incentivized. Rational play dictates defecting to maximize immediate individual gain, as there are no consequences for future rounds. This prevents exploitation by other players who are also likely to defect in the final round.

**3. Be Collective - Alignment with the Collective Mindset**

This strategy embodies a collective mindset by:
*   **Prioritizing Initial Cooperation:** It always starts by contributing, giving every player a chance to participate in a mutually beneficial outcome.
*   **Fostering Forgiveness (Conditional):** It is designed to be forgiving of minor deviations (`D_{t-1} = 1` for `n > 2`), which is essential for building and sustaining fragile cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. This resilience helps maintain higher overall contribution levels for the group.
*   **Punishing Exploitation (Proportionally):** It strategically defects when cooperation levels drop significantly (two or more defectors, or the single defector in a two-player game). This is not for individual gain but to signal that widespread free-riding is detrimental to the collective and will be met with consequences, thereby encouraging a return to higher cooperation.
*   **Adapting to Group Size:** The nuanced response to a single defector based on `n` ensures the strategy remains robust and prevents obvious exploitation across different game configurations, contributing to stable collective outcomes.
*   **Rational End-Game Play:** The final round defection prevents collective exploitation when the game structure removes all incentives for future cooperation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_112 = '''
The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity with Forgiveness," is designed to encourage and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game, adapting to observed behavior while remaining robust against exploitation. It prioritizes collective welfare by promoting a high threshold for cooperation but acknowledges the individual incentive to defect in specific circumstances, especially in the final round.

---

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity with Forgiveness**

This strategy maintains an internal state, `current_stance`, which can be either "Cooperate" or "Defect". It is initialized to "Cooperate" before Round 1.

**Game Parameters used:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Play):**
    *   **Action:** Always Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Begin by signaling a willingness to cooperate and foster a positive collective environment. This establishes an initial state for observation in subsequent rounds.
    *   Set `current_stance = "Cooperate"`.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Play):**
    *   At the start of each of these rounds, observe `total_contributions_prev`, which is the sum of contributions from all `n` players (including myself) in the immediately preceding round.

    *   **If `current_stance` is "Cooperate":**
        *   **Cooperation Threshold (`T_C`):** `T_C = max(2, floor(n * 0.75))`
            *   If `total_contributions_prev >= T_C` (i.e., at least 75% of players contributed, minimum 2):
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** Collective cooperation is sufficiently high to warrant continued contribution. Maintain the positive dynamic.
                *   `current_stance` remains "Cooperate".
            *   Else (`total_contributions_prev < T_C`):
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** Cooperation levels have fallen below an acceptable threshold. To prevent exploitation and signal dissatisfaction, switch to defection.
                *   Set `current_stance = "Defect"`.

    *   **If `current_stance` is "Defect":**
        *   **Forgiveness Threshold (`T_F`):** `T_F = n`
            *   If `total_contributions_prev == T_F` (i.e., absolutely everyone, including other players, contributed):
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** The collective has demonstrated a full commitment to cooperation. This highly demanding threshold allows for forgiveness and an attempt to re-establish a cooperative equilibrium.
                *   Set `current_stance = "Cooperate"`.
            *   Else (`total_contributions_prev < T_F`):
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** Insufficient commitment to cooperation was observed. Continue to defect to avoid exploitation.
                *   `current_stance` remains "Defect".

3.  **Round `r` (Final Round):**
    *   **Action:** Always Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the last round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to influence. Backward induction implies that the individually rational strategy is to defect to maximize immediate personal gain, regardless of past actions. Adopting this stance prevents exploitation by other potentially self-interested strategies in a tournament setting.

---

**Collective Alignment and Robustness:**

*   **Collective Mindset:** The strategy begins with an act of cooperation and sets high thresholds for both maintaining cooperation (`T_C`) and re-establishing it after defection (`T_F`). This encourages robust collective action and punishes significant free-riding, aiming for overall higher collective payoffs. The ability to forgive (via `T_F`) prevents a permanent breakdown of cooperation.
*   **Adaptability:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed collective contribution levels in the previous round, rather than being rigidly fixed.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   **Against Pure Defectors:** Will quickly switch to defecting after Round 1, minimizing losses.
    *   **Against Pure Cooperators:** Will maintain cooperation, contributing to a high collective payoff, as long as `T_C` is met by the group.
    *   **Against Reciprocal Strategies:** Allows for the establishment and maintenance of cooperation, and provides a clear mechanism for recovery if cooperation breaks down.
    *   **Against Exploitation:** The final-round defection rule prevents being a "sucker" in the absence of future incentives. The `T_C` and `T_F` parameters are set to require significant collective effort, making it harder for a few defectors to exploit a larger cooperative group for extended periods.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_113 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity," is designed to foster and sustain high levels of cooperation in the Public Goods Game, aiming to maximize collective welfare while robustly protecting against exploitation. It operates on principles of conditional cooperation, starting with an optimistic stance, adapting to the group's behavior, and anticipating end-game dynamics.

---

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity**

**Objective:** To achieve and maintain a high level of overall contributions to the public good, thereby maximizing the total collective payoff. This is accomplished by signaling a willingness to cooperate, rewarding observed cooperation from others, and deterring free-riding.

**Core Principle:** This strategy assumes that other players are also capable of learning and adapting. It seeks to establish a cooperative equilibrium through conditional reciprocity, making itself "nice" but "provocable" and "forgiving."

---

**Decision Rules:**

For player `i` in round `t` (out of `r` total rounds):

1.  **Initial Rounds (Building Trust):**
    *   **If `t` is Round 1 or Round 2:**
        *   **Action: CONTRIBUTE (C)**
        *   *Rationale:* This initial phase signals a strong intent to cooperate and provides an opportunity for other players to observe and reciprocate. It acts as an olive branch to initiate a positive cycle of contributions.

2.  **Endgame (Anticipating Rationality):**
    *   **If `t` is Round `r` (the final round):**
        *   **Action: DEFECT (D)**
        *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions for reciprocity or punishment. The dominant strategy for rational players is to defect to maximize immediate gain, as cooperation would lead to guaranteed exploitation. This rule anticipates such behavior and protects against being a "sucker" in the closing moments of the game.

3.  **Intermediate Adaptive Rounds (`2 < t < r`):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t`, the player observes the contributions of all other players from the *immediately preceding* round (`t-1`).
    *   Let `N_others = n - 1` be the total number of other players in the game.
    *   Let `C_others_prev` be the count of other players who **CONTRIBUTED (C)** in round `t-1`.
    *   Calculate the **Average Contribution Rate of Others** from the previous round: `Avg_Contrib_Rate_Others = C_others_prev / N_others`.

    *   **Conditional Decision:**
        *   **If `Avg_Contrib_Rate_Others >= 0.5`** (i.e., 50% or more of the other players contributed in the previous round):
            *   **Action: CONTRIBUTE (C)**
            *   *Rationale:* This action rewards and reinforces collective cooperation. It indicates that the player recognizes and supports a sufficient level of engagement from the group, sustaining the cooperative equilibrium.
        *   **Else (`Avg_Contrib_Rate_Others < 0.5`)** (i.e., less than 50% of the other players contributed in the previous round):
            *   **Action: DEFECT (D)**
            *   *Rationale:* This acts as a clear and swift signal that insufficient collective effort or free-riding will not be tolerated. It serves as a deterrent against exploitation and encourages others to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds to restore a cooperative environment.

---

**Key Characteristics and Alignment with Requirements:**

*   **Adaptive and Robust:** The strategy constantly monitors the collective behavior of others and adjusts its own action. It can adapt to varying levels of cooperation from opponents, responding to both collaborative and exploitative tendencies. It is robust to single mistakes or minor defections due to the 50% threshold, allowing for recovery.
*   **Collective Mindset:** By starting with cooperation and rewarding collective contributions, the strategy explicitly aims to foster and sustain an environment of high contributions for the common good. Its retaliation mechanisms are not purely self-serving but rather designed to correct deviations from a collectively beneficial state.
*   **Edge Cases Handled:** Specific rules are provided for the critical first few rounds (to initiate cooperation) and the final round (to handle the end-game effect).
*   **Dependencies:** The strategy depends solely on the game parameters (`n`, `r`) and the observable history of actions from all players. No communication or external signals are assumed.
*   **Natural Language:** Described clearly in natural language, with rationales for each decision.

This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**, aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It is designed to be adaptive to the group's behavior and robust to varying game parameters and opponent strategies, while protecting against exploitation.

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (where `1 < k < n`)

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Initial Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy always begins by making a contribution. This serves as an initial signal of willingness to cooperate, testing the environment for potential mutual cooperation among players and setting a cooperative tone for the game.

2.  **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** In a finite repeated game, the principle of backward induction suggests that there is no incentive for any player to contribute in the final round. There are no subsequent rounds for reciprocal reward or punishment. Defecting in the last round protects the player from being exploited by others who will likely also defect to maximize their final payoff.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of each intermediate round, the strategy observes the total number of contributions made by *all players* in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`). Let this sum be `S_prev_round`.
    *   **Calculate Cooperation Threshold:** The strategy determines a dynamic threshold for the minimum number of contributions required from the group to warrant its continued individual cooperation.
        *   `Cooperation_Threshold = ceil(n / k)`
        *   **Rationale for Threshold:** This `Cooperation_Threshold` represents the minimum number of contributors required in the previous round for the *average benefit derived from the common pool* to be efficient enough to theoretically justify individual contributions. If `k` is high (meaning contributions are very efficient), this threshold will be lower (more forgiving). If `k` is low (meaning contributions are less efficient), the threshold will be higher (more cautious), requiring more collective effort to sustain cooperation. This threshold helps ensure that the strategy is contributing to a collective effort that is sufficiently productive.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `S_prev_round >= Cooperation_Threshold`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   **Rationale:** If the observed collective effort in the previous round met or exceeded the calculated efficiency threshold, the strategy reciprocates by contributing. This reinforces and rewards cooperative behavior within the group, aiming to sustain a high level of collective welfare.
        *   Else (if `S_prev_round < Cooperation_Threshold`):
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**
            *   **Rationale:** If the observed collective effort fell below the efficiency threshold, the strategy defects. This acts as a signal that insufficient cooperation is occurring, protects the player from excessive exploitation, and encourages the group to increase its contributions in future rounds if collective benefits are to be realized.

---

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** By contributing in the first round, the strategy proactively attempts to establish a cooperative environment.
*   **Rewards Collective Effort:** It continues to contribute when the group demonstrates a sufficient commitment to the public good, as defined by the game parameters (`n` and `k`).
*   **Deters Exploitation:** By defecting when cooperation falls below a justifiable and objectively calculated threshold, the strategy avoids being a perpetual "sucker" and prevents free-riders from completely undermining the collective welfare.
*   **Adaptive for Sustainability:** The dynamic `Cooperation_Threshold` based on `n/k` ensures that the strategy's participation is tied to the efficiency of the public good itself, making its collective approach robust and sustainable across different game configurations. This balance promotes the highest possible collective payoff without sacrificing individual resilience.

description_COLLECTIVE_115 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Enforcement (ACE)**, is designed to navigate the Public Goods Game by proactively seeking collective cooperation, enforcing it when possible, and adapting to individual incentives, especially towards the end of the game. It uses past group behavior to condition its future actions, aiming to establish and maintain the highest possible collective welfare.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Enforcement (ACE)

**Overview:**
ACE initiates with a cooperative stance to signal its intent for collective welfare. It rigorously monitors the group's contribution level and punishes any deviation from full cooperation for a set duration. After this punitive phase, it attempts to re-establish cooperation. A crucial element is its adaptive response to the end-game scenario, where individual rationality often leads to a breakdown of cooperation.

**State Variables** (maintained by this player for the group's history):
*   `GroupCooperationState`: An enumeration with two possible values: `COOPERATE` or `PUNISH`. This indicates the strategy's current disposition towards the group.
*   `PunishmentRoundsRemaining`: An integer, tracking how many rounds of defection are left when the strategy is in the `PUNISH` state.

**Game Parameters** (provided at the start of the game):
*   `n`: The total number of players in the game.
*   `r_total`: The total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: The multiplier for contributions (where `1 < k < n`).

**Internal Strategy Parameters:**
*   `PUNISHMENT_DURATION`: An integer, set to `3`. This value determines how many consecutive rounds the strategy will defect when it enters the `PUNISH` state. This duration is chosen to be long enough to signal severity but short enough to allow for recovery and re-establishment of cooperation.

---

**1. Decision Rules - When do you cooperate vs defect?**

**Initialization (Before Round 1):**
*   Set `GroupCooperationState = COOPERATE`.
*   Set `PunishmentRoundsRemaining = 0`.
    *Rationale:* The strategy begins with an assumption of good faith, initiating cooperation to encourage the collective optimum.

**Decision for Player *i* in the current `RoundNumber`:**

**a. End-Game Anticipation:**
*   If `RoundNumber > r_total - PUNISHMENT_DURATION`:
    *   **Action:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
    *   *Rationale:* As the game approaches its final rounds, the "shadow of the future" (the potential for future reciprocal cooperation) diminishes. Rational players are increasingly likely to defect to maximize their individual short-term gains. This rule prevents ACE from being exploited in these closing stages by preemptively adopting a defensive, individually rational stance.

**b. Standard Round Decision (when not in end-game):**
*   Else (if not in the end-game period):
    *   If `GroupCooperationState == COOPERATE`:
        *   **Action:** Contribute (contribute 1 token).
        *   *Rationale:* This strategy aims for the collective optimum. It contributes to signal a willingness to cooperate and continues to do so as long as the group maintains its cooperative behavior.
    *   If `GroupCooperationState == PUNISH`:
        *   **Action:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
        *   *Rationale:* When in the `PUNISH` state, the strategy defects as a direct response to previous insufficient group contributions. This punitive action serves as a deterrent against free-riding and an attempt to reset expectations for future cooperation.

---

**2. Handle edge cases - What do you do in the first round, last round, etc.?**

*   **First Round (`RoundNumber = 1`):** The strategy starts in the `COOPERATE` state and contributes 1 token, as per the "Standard Round Decision" (since `1` is unlikely to be `> r_total - PUNISHMENT_DURATION`).
*   **Last Rounds (`RoundNumber > r_total - PUNISHMENT_DURATION`):** The "End-Game Anticipation" rule takes precedence. The strategy will defect (contribute 0 tokens) for the final `PUNISHMENT_DURATION` rounds, regardless of its `GroupCooperationState`. This handles the end-game unraveling effect.

---

**3. Be collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset**

The strategy's collective mindset is primarily reflected in its robust mechanism for enforcing full group cooperation:

**State Update (After each `RoundNumber`, observing all players' actions `c_j` and payoffs):**

1.  **Update `PunishmentRoundsRemaining`:**
    *   If `GroupCooperationState == PUNISH`:
        *   Decrement `PunishmentRoundsRemaining` by 1.
        *   If `PunishmentRoundsRemaining == 0`:
            *   Transition `GroupCooperationState = COOPERATE`.
            *   *Rationale:* Once the predetermined punishment period is over, the strategy resets to the `COOPERATE` state. This gives the group another chance to re-establish full cooperation, preventing perpetual defection and allowing for potential recovery from breakdowns.

2.  **Evaluate for New Punishment (If currently in `COOPERATE` state and not in end-game):**
    *   If `GroupCooperationState == COOPERATE` AND `RoundNumber <= r_total - PUNISHMENT_DURATION`:
        *   Calculate `total_contributions_this_round = sum_j c_j` (where `c_j` is player `j`'s contribution in the just-completed round).
        *   If `total_contributions_this_round < n`:
            *   Transition `GroupCooperationState = PUNISH`.
            *   Set `PunishmentRoundsRemaining = PUNISHMENT_DURATION`.
            *   *Rationale:* This is the core of the collective enforcement. If even a single player (including this strategy, though it would have contributed if in `COOPERATE` state) fails to contribute fully, it is considered a breach of collective cooperation. This triggers a punitive phase, signaling that full contribution is expected and deviations will be met with defection for a set number of rounds, aiming to guide the group back to the collectively optimal outcome.

**Robustness and Adaptiveness:**
ACE is adaptive as it changes its behavior based on observed group actions. It's robust because it can:
*   Sustain cooperation against other cooperative strategies.
*   Punish and potentially convert non-cooperative behaviors.
*   Avoid being exploited by always-defect strategies (by switching to `PUNISH` or `End-Game Anticipation`).
*   Recover from temporary breakdowns in cooperation.

This strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Strategy with Majority Threshold," aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation while protecting individual interests from exploitation. It prioritizes the collective good by initiating cooperation and rewarding widespread participation, but it also enforces a norm by defecting when collective effort is insufficient.

**Strategy Description: Adaptive Collective Strategy with Majority Threshold**

This strategy relies on observing the collective behavior in the previous round to decide its action for the current round. It has a specific approach for the first round and the last round due to their unique dynamics.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of any history, the strategy takes a proactive step to initiate cooperation. This signals willingness to contribute to the collective good and provides an opportunity for others to reciprocate, potentially bootstrapping a cooperative equilibrium.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round `t` where `1 < t < r`):**
    *   **Observation:** At the end of round `t-1`, observe the total number of players who contributed (`C_past`).
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   If `C_past >= floor(n/2) + 1` (i.e., a strict majority of players contributed in the previous round):
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   **Rationale:** This indicates a healthy level of collective engagement. The strategy supports and reinforces this positive collective behavior to maintain the public good. It's a reward for sufficient cooperation.
        *   Else (i.e., `C_past < floor(n/2) + 1`, meaning less than a strict majority contributed):
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**
            *   **Rationale:** This serves as a punishment for insufficient collective effort and protects the strategist from being exploited by widespread free-riding. If a clear majority is not willing to contribute, the collective effort is too weak to warrant individual contribution. This action aims to incentivize greater future cooperation by making defection costly for the free-riders.

3.  **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Rationale:** Due to backward induction, there are no future rounds for players to influence behavior or be influenced. In this final round, the individually rational choice is to defect, regardless of past actions or the actions of others, as contributing provides no strategic benefit for future interactions.

**Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **Game Length (`r=1`):** If the game consists of only one round, the "Last Round" rule takes precedence. The strategy will **Defect (D)**.
*   **Small Number of Players (`n`):** The `floor(n/2) + 1` threshold adapts naturally. For example, if `n=2`, the threshold is `floor(2/2) + 1 = 2`. Both players must contribute to trigger cooperation. If `n=3`, the threshold is `floor(3/2) + 1 = 2`. At least two players must contribute. This ensures a meaningful level of collective commitment is present.

**Collective Alignment:**

This strategy is inherently collective because it:
*   **Initiates Cooperation:** It actively tries to establish a cooperative environment by contributing in the first round.
*   **Rewards Collective Effort:** It continues to cooperate when a strong majority demonstrates a commitment to the public good, thereby sustaining the collectively beneficial outcome where all players receive `k`.
*   **Punishes Insufficient Collective Effort:** By defecting when cooperation falls below a critical majority, it creates a disincentive for widespread free-riding, which helps stabilize cooperation and discourages players from eroding the public good.
*   **Protects Against Exploitation:** While aiming for collective welfare, it avoids being a "sucker" by not contributing indefinitely in the face of widespread defection, maintaining individual rationality within the collective framework.

By using a clear, majority-based threshold, the strategy is adaptive to actual player behaviors and robust across varying game parameters (especially `k`, which influences the *benefit* of cooperation but not the fundamental *trigger* for collective action).

description_COLLECTIVE_117 = '''
**Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)**

**Core Principle:** This strategy aims to foster and sustain high levels of collective cooperation by initiating with a cooperative stance and then adaptively reciprocating the observed level of group contribution. It demands a substantial majority of players to contribute to continue its own contribution, thereby punishing widespread free-riding while being resilient to minor deviations. It adopts a purely rational stance in the final round.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Contribute (C).** The strategy begins by contributing its token. This action signals a willingness to cooperate and attempts to seed a positive cooperative environment for the group.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t` (where `1 < t < r`), observe the total number of contributors `C_{t-1}` from the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   **Cooperation Threshold Calculation:** Determine the minimum number of cooperators required to continue contributing. This threshold is set as a fixed proportion of the total players:
        `Required_Cooperators = floor(n * 0.75)`
        (This means approximately 75% of players must have contributed in the previous round).
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `C_{t-1} >= Required_Cooperators`:**
            *   **Contribute (C).** The group demonstrated sufficient collective effort and cooperation. The strategy reciprocates this by continuing to contribute, aiming to sustain the high level of collective welfare.
        *   **Else (`C_{t-1} < Required_Cooperators`):**
            *   **Defect (D).** The group's cooperation level was below the required threshold, indicating widespread free-riding or insufficient collective contribution. The strategy withdraws its contribution as a corrective signal and to avoid being exploited.

3.  **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Defect (D).** In the final round of a finite game, there are no subsequent interactions for actions to influence. Contributing offers no strategic benefit and results in a direct individual loss. Therefore, the strategy makes the individually rational choice to defect.

**Rationale and Collective Alignment:**

*   **Promotes Collective Welfare:** By demanding a high `Required_Cooperators` threshold, the strategy actively pushes the group towards the collectively optimal outcome where a large majority (ideally all) contribute, maximizing the overall benefits (`k * n` total payoff).
*   **Adaptive Reciprocity:** The strategy adapts its behavior based on the observed collective action of the group in the previous round, rather than individual player histories. This makes it a "Collective Tit-for-Tat" variant.
*   **Robustness to Free-Riding:** The relatively high threshold of 75% ensures that the strategy is not easily exploited by a few free-riders. It will quickly switch to defection if cooperation significantly dwindles.
*   **Forgiveness (Limited):** It tolerates a minority of defections (up to 25% of players) without immediately collapsing into full defection, allowing for some volatility in group behavior.
*   **Rational Endgame:** Acknowledging the "endgame problem" in finite repeated games, the strategy defects in the final round to prevent exploitation, which is a key aspect of robustness in a tournament setting.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_118 = '''
The following strategy, "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)", is designed to maximize collective welfare while remaining robust and adaptive to the behaviors of other independent strategies in the tournament. It leverages observable past actions to foster cooperation and deter exploitation.

---

### Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR) Strategy Description

**Core Principle:**
ACR aims to establish and maintain a cooperative equilibrium by initiating cooperation and then adapting its behavior based on the observed collective contribution rate among other players. It seeks to encourage mutual benefit (collective welfare) while protecting against exploitation by purely selfish or opportunistic opponents, which is crucial in a tournament setting with independent strategies.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round `t = 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy begins by contributing to signal a willingness to cooperate and to create an initial opportunity for a high-payoff cooperative outcome for all players. This exploratory cooperation is essential to ascertain the cooperative potential of the group.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds `1 < t < r`):**
    *   At the start of round `t`, the strategy observes the actions of all players from the *immediately preceding round* (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculate `Others_Contributed_Count`:** Determine the number of players *other than yourself* who contributed (chose C) in round `t-1`.
    *   **Calculate `Cooperation_Rate_Among_Others`:** Divide `Others_Contributed_Count` by `(n-1)` (the total number of other players). This metric represents the proportion of other players who contributed in the last round.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `Cooperation_Rate_Among_Others >= 0.5`:**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** If at least half of the other players contributed, it indicates a sufficient level of collective effort and willingness to cooperate. Continuing to contribute reinforces this positive behavior, aiming for sustained high collective payoffs and further encouraging cooperation.
        *   **Else (`Cooperation_Rate_Among_Others < 0.5`):**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (contribute 0 tokens).
            *   **Rationale:** If less than half of the other players contributed, it signals a significant breakdown in collective action or an attempt at exploitation. Defecting in response protects against being a "sucker" (contributing while others free-ride) and serves as a punitive measure, potentially incentivizing others to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds to re-establish cooperation.

3.  **Last Round (Round `t = r`):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)** (contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions for reciprocity, reputation building, or influencing future behavior. From a purely game-theoretic standpoint, the dominant strategy is to defect to maximize one's immediate payoff. This prevents being exploited by rational opponents who will also likely defect in the absence of future consequences.

**Robustness and Adaptability:**
*   **Adaptability:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed average cooperation level of others, allowing it to respond effectively to a wide range of opponent behaviors—from full cooperation to widespread defection.
*   **Robustness:** ACR is designed to avoid being exploited. While it initiates and maintains cooperation under favorable conditions, it will revert to defection if others do not sufficiently reciprocate. The `0.5` threshold for `Cooperation_Rate_Among_Others` provides a balanced approach: it's forgiving enough to allow for some non-cooperation without immediate collapse, but firm enough to prevent continuous exploitation. Defecting in the last round is a key robustness feature for finite games.
*   **Collective Mindset Alignment:** ACR explicitly attempts to foster a high-cooperation outcome, which benefits all participants more than universal defection (given `k > 1`). Its conditional cooperation mechanism encourages others to also cooperate, leading to higher collective payoffs for the group when implemented by multiple players. The protective measures against exploitation are necessary to make a collective strategy viable in a competitive environment.

**Information Use:**
The strategy strictly adheres to the rule that it depends only on the game parameters (`n`, `k`, `r`) and the observed actions of all players from previous rounds. No communication, signaling, or coordination channels are assumed.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_119 = '''
This strategy is designed to maximize collective welfare by promoting and sustaining high levels of cooperation, while also protecting against exploitation by free-riders. It is adaptive, responding to the observed behavior of the group, and robust against various opponent strategies.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Group Reciprocity with Forgiveness

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Initiate cooperation and signal a willingness to contribute for the collective benefit. This sets a cooperative tone and gives all players an opportunity to reciprocate.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   **Observation:** After round `t-1` is completed, observe `C_t-1`, the total number of players who contributed in the previous round.
    *   **Decision Threshold:**
        *   If `C_t-1 >= (n - 1)` (meaning at most one player defected in the previous round):
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** Reward collective cooperation and encourage its continuation. This strategy tolerates a single defector, providing a chance for that player to realign with the cooperative group in subsequent rounds without immediately collapsing the collective effort.
        *   If `C_t-1 < (n - 1)` (meaning two or more players defected in the previous round):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** Punish significant free-riding. This signals that widespread non-cooperation will be met with defection, protecting against exploitation and incentivizing a return to cooperation. It acts as a collective trigger for retaliation.

*   **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** Based on backward induction in finite repeated games, the final round offers no future interactions to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. The dominant individual strategy is to defect, regardless of past actions. This action prevents being exploited by others who will rationally defect.

**2. Edge Cases Handled:**

*   **First Round:** Explicitly defined as a cooperative attempt.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly defined as a self-protective defection.
*   **Intermediate Rounds:** Decisions are made adaptively based on the previous round's collective contribution, using a clear threshold to determine continued cooperation or triggered defection.

**3. Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

*   **Promotes Cooperation:** The strategy begins with cooperation and continues to cooperate as long as the vast majority of players contribute, aiming for the maximum collective payoff (`k` for each player).
*   **Protects Against Exploitation:** It is not a naive Always Cooperate strategy. It defends against widespread free-riding by defecting when a significant number of players fail to contribute, preventing individual players using this strategy from being continuously exploited.
*   **Adaptive and Forgiving:** The `(n-1)` threshold provides a balance. It is firm enough to deter widespread defection but forgiving enough to absorb minor deviations (e.g., one player testing the waters or making a mistake) without immediately spiraling into total defection, thus allowing cooperation to be re-established. This increases the robustness of collective cooperation against minor shocks.

description_COLLECTIVE_120 = '''
Strategy Name: Dynamic Collective Reciprocity (DCR)

**Overview:**
This strategy is designed to promote and sustain cooperation in the Public Goods Game by exhibiting conditional generosity, proportional punishment, and a clear exit strategy for the endgame. It balances the need to foster collective welfare (high contributions to the public good) with self-preservation against exploitation. The strategy aims to guide the group towards maximal contributions by being an initial cooperator, patient with minor deviations, firm against persistent free-riding, and forgiving upon strong evidence of renewed collective effort.

**Parameters (derived from game setup and tuned for robustness):**
*   `n`: Number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for the public good.
*   `INITIAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`: 0.7 (A threshold for the proportion of cooperators. If less than 70% of players contributed in the previous round, it signifies a potential problem in collective cooperation).
*   `PATIENCE_ROUNDS_BEFORE_PUNISH`: `max(2, floor(r / 5))` (The number of consecutive rounds where cooperation falls below `INITIAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD` that the strategy will tolerate before temporarily switching to 'Punish_Mode'. This provides patience and adapts to game length).
*   `FORGIVENESS_COOPERATION_RATE`: 0.9 (A higher threshold (90%) for the proportion of cooperators required to switch *back* to 'Cooperate_Mode' after a period of punishment, ensuring a strong signal of renewed collective effort).

**Internal State Variables (initialized at the start of Round 1):**
*   `current_mode`: A state indicator, either 'Cooperate_Mode' (default) or 'Punish_Mode'. Initially set to 'Cooperate_Mode'.
*   `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds`: An integer counter for rounds where the observed cooperation rate fell below `INITIAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD` while in 'Cooperate_Mode'. Initially set to 0.

**Decision Rules per Round (t):**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Overture):**
    *   Initialize `current_mode = 'Cooperate_Mode'`.
    *   Initialize `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds = 0`.
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   *Rationale:* This establishes good faith, signals a willingness to cooperate, and provides an initial data point for others to observe, promoting an atmosphere of potential collaboration.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (t from 2 to r-1):**
    *   First, observe the actions of all players from the *previous* round (t-1).
    *   Calculate `P_cooperators_last_round = (sum of contributions in round t-1) / n`.

    *   **If `current_mode` is 'Cooperate_Mode':**
        *   If `P_cooperators_last_round >= INITIAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
            *   Reset `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds = 0`.
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   *Rationale:* The group's cooperation level is satisfactory. Continue contributing to sustain the public good and positive collective outcome.
        *   Else (`P_cooperators_last_round < INITIAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):
            *   Increment `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds`.
            *   If `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds >= PATIENCE_ROUNDS_BEFORE_PUNISH`:
                *   Switch `current_mode` to 'Punish_Mode'.
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                    *   *Rationale:* The group's cooperation has been consistently low for a prolonged period. This indicates persistent free-riding or a breakdown in collective action. A period of defection serves as a punishment to discourage further exploitation and signal the need for improved group cooperation.
            *   Else (still within the patience limit):
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                    *   *Rationale:* While cooperation is below optimal, it hasn't persisted long enough to warrant full punishment. This act of generosity and patience allows the group more time to self-correct, preventing overreaction to minor fluctuations and fostering a resilient cooperative environment.

    *   **If `current_mode` is 'Punish_Mode':**
        *   If `P_cooperators_last_round >= FORGIVENESS_COOPERATION_RATE`:
            *   Switch `current_mode` back to 'Cooperate_Mode'.
            *   Reset `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds = 0`.
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   *Rationale:* The group has demonstrated a strong rebound in cooperation, indicating that the punishment was effective or that collective norms have re-established. Forgive past defections and re-engage in cooperation to capitalize on the renewed collective effort.
        *   Else (`P_cooperators_last_round < FORGIVENESS_COOPERATION_RATE`):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   *Rationale:* The group's cooperation remains too low for forgiveness. Continue the period of defection to reinforce the consequence of widespread free-riding until a clear and strong signal of collective recovery is observed.

3.  **Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Action:** Always Defect (D).
        *   *Rationale:* In a finite repeated game, the last round has no future consequences. Backward induction dictates that individual defection is the dominant strategy as there's no incentive for future cooperation. This decision maximizes the individual payoff in the final round without impacting any subsequent collective interaction.

This strategy is designed to foster and maintain cooperation in the Public Goods Game, aligning with a collective mindset while remaining adaptive and robust in a tournament setting. It operates on principles of conditional cooperation, patience, and end-game rationality.

**Strategy Name:** Dynamic Collective Reciprocator

**Internal State:**
*   `current_ECR`: A floating-point value initialized to `1.0`. This represents the strategy's current Expected Cooperation Rate from the group, acting as a weighted average of past observed cooperation.

**Strategy Parameters:**
*   `Forgiveness_Factor (F)`: `0.7`. (A value between 0 and 1. Closer to 1 implies more patience and a slower adjustment downwards of the `current_ECR`.)
*   `Base_Optimism_Threshold (BOT)`: `0.4`. (A minimum floor for the `Adaptive_Optimism_Threshold`, preventing the strategy from becoming overly pessimistic even in low-cooperation environments).
*   `K_N_Factor_Weight`: `0.1`. (Determines how much the `k/n` ratio influences the adaptive optimism threshold. This helps the strategy scale its expectations with the game's inherent individual incentive to defect.)

**Decision Rules for Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **If `t == r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finitely repeated game, there are no future interactions for reciprocity. Standard game theory dictates defection as the individually rational and dominant strategy. This prevents exploitation by others who are also likely to defect.

2.  **If `t == 1` (and `r > 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** To initiate cooperation and signal a willingness to contribute. This is crucial for a collective strategy to explore the potential for a cooperative equilibrium in repeated interactions. If `r=1`, this rule is superseded by the `t == r` rule, resulting in Defect (D).

3.  **If `t > 1` and `t < r` (Adaptive Play for Intermediate Rounds):**
    *   **Observe Past Actions:** Retrieve `c_j_t-1` for all players `j` (including self) from the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculate `Observed_Cooperation_Rate (OCR_t-1)`:**
        `OCR_t-1 = (sum_j c_j_t-1) / n`
        (This is the proportion of players who contributed in the last round.)
    *   **Update `current_ECR`:**
        `current_ECR = F * current_ECR + (1 - F) * OCR_t-1`
        (This updates the strategy's long-term expectation of group cooperation, weighting past expectation more heavily than the most recent observation, due to `F=0.7`).
    *   **Calculate `Adaptive_Optimism_Threshold (AOT)`:**
        `AOT = max(BOT, (k/n) + K_N_Factor_Weight)`
        (This threshold for maintaining optimism dynamically adjusts. It's at least `BOT`, and increases if `k/n` is high, meaning a higher individual return from collective contributions implies higher expected cooperation).

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **Condition 1: Strong Recent Cooperation**
            *   If `OCR_t-1 >= (k/n)`:
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** If the observed collective contribution rate in the previous round was at or above `k/n` (meaning total contributions `sum_j c_j_t-1 >= k`), it signals a sufficiently strong collective effort. The strategy rewards this by continuing to contribute, reinforcing the cooperative behavior.
        *   **Condition 2: Sustained Optimism Despite Lower Recent Cooperation**
            *   Else (if `OCR_t-1 < (k/n)`):
                *   If `current_ECR >= AOT`:
                    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                    *   **Rationale:** Even if the previous round's cooperation was somewhat low, if the overall long-term expectation (`current_ECR`) is still above the dynamically adjusted `AOT`, the strategy remains optimistic. This reflects patience and forgiveness, giving the group a chance to recover from minor dips in cooperation, aligning with the collective mindset to avoid rapid defection spirals.
                *   Else (if `current_ECR < AOT`):
                    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                    *   **Rationale:** Both the previous round's observed cooperation was low, and the long-term expectation of cooperation (`current_ECR`) has fallen below the adaptive threshold. This indicates that sustained cooperation is unlikely, and the strategy must protect itself from continued exploitation by defecting.

---

**Collective Mindset Alignment:**
*   **Initiates Cooperation:** Always starts with a contribution (C) (unless `r=1`), signaling a proactive stance towards collective welfare.
*   **Rewards Cooperation:** Continues to contribute when observed cooperation is strong, even if individual short-term gain is not guaranteed.
*   **Forgiving and Patient:** Uses `Forgiveness_Factor` and `Adaptive_Optimism_Threshold` to tolerate temporary dips in cooperation, providing opportunities for recovery and preventing swift descent into universal defection.
*   **Adaptive to Game Parameters:** Adjusts its internal `AOT` based on `k/n`, recognizing that the intrinsic incentive to cooperate varies with these parameters.

**Robustness and Adaptiveness:**
*   **Adaptive:** The `current_ECR` and `AOT` dynamically adjust to the actual observed behavior of other players and the game parameters.
*   **Responsive:** Reacts to both high and low levels of cooperation from others, rewarding good behavior and sanctioning persistent free-riding.
*   **Tournament Ready:** The strategy is deterministic (no random actions), making its behavior predictable given a history. It incorporates self-protection against exploitation (through end-game defection and punishment for persistent non-cooperation) while striving for collective benefit.
*   **Handles Edge Cases:** Explicitly defines behavior for the first and last rounds, ensuring predictable and strategically sound play in these critical phases.

description_COLLECTIVE_122 = '''
This strategy, named **Forgiving Collective Reciprocity (FCR)**, is designed to foster and sustain high levels of cooperation in the Public Goods Game, while being robust to diverse opponent behaviors in a tournament setting. It operates with a clear collective mindset, aiming for maximal group benefit by incentivizing universal contribution, yet it protects itself from consistent exploitation.

**Strategy: Forgiving Collective Reciprocity (FCR)**

**Overall Goal:** The primary objective of FCR is to establish and maintain a state of full cooperation among all players, recognizing that this yields the highest collective welfare. It achieves this by starting cooperatively and then conditionally responding to the group's past actions, allowing for recovery from breakdowns while preventing sustained exploitation.

**Internal State:** The strategy maintains an internal `Current_Stance` which can be either 'Cooperate' or 'Defect'. This stance dictates the player's action for the current round.

---

**1. Decision Rules - When do you cooperate vs defect?**

*   **Round 1: Initiate Cooperation**
    *   **Action:** Always Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** To signal a willingness to contribute to the collective good and to attempt to initiate a cycle of cooperation among all players from the outset. The `Current_Stance` is implicitly 'Cooperate' at the start of the game.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to r-1): Conditional Reciprocity based on Collective Action**
    *   **Observation:** At the start of each intermediate round, FCR observes the `Total_Contributions_Last_Round` (i.e., the sum of contributions `sum_j c_j` from *all players*, including itself) from the immediately preceding round.
    *   **Stance Update and Action:**
        *   **If `Total_Contributions_Last_Round == n` (Unanimous Cooperation):**
            *   The strategy's `Current_Stance` is updated to 'Cooperate'.
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** When all players contributed in the last round, the collective good was maximized. FCR reinforces this positive outcome by continuing to contribute, sustaining the cooperative equilibrium.
        *   **If `Total_Contributions_Last_Round < n` (Any Defection Occurred):**
            *   The strategy's `Current_Stance` is updated to 'Defect'.
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If one or more players chose to defect, the collective good was undermined. FCR responds by withholding its contribution. This acts as a clear signal of disapproval, a punishment for free-riding, and an incentive for all players to contribute in future rounds if they wish to return to a fully cooperative state.

---

**2. Handle Edge Cases**

*   **First Round (Round 1):** Handled above (Always Contribute).
*   **Last Round (Round r): Self-Interest Due to Backward Induction**
    *   **Action:** Always Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, standard game theory dictates that there is no future opportunity to reward cooperation or punish defection. Therefore, the individually rational choice is to defect, as contributing would only incur a personal cost without any subsequent collective benefit or influence on future play. This is a robust, self-preserving behavior for the final round.

---

**3. Be Collective - Clearly align with the collective mindset**

FCR aligns with a collective mindset through several key features:

*   **Proactive Cooperation:** It always initiates play with a contribution, signaling its desire for a cooperative outcome.
*   **High Bar for Collective Good:** It explicitly aims for *universal* cooperation (`Total_Contributions_Last_Round == n`) as the only condition for continuing its own cooperative stance. This sets a strong standard for achieving maximum collective welfare.
*   **Punishment as Incentive:** When cooperation falters (even by a single defector), it defects to punish free-riding. This punishment is not merely self-interested; it serves as a powerful incentive for *all* players to return to full cooperation for the benefit of the group.
*   **Forgiveness and Recovery:** Crucially, FCR is "forgiving." Unlike a harsh Grim Trigger strategy, it does not defect forever once triggered. If all players *do* manage to return to full cooperation in a subsequent round, FCR immediately reverts to its 'Cooperate' stance, allowing the group to recover from breakdowns and re-establish a high-welfare equilibrium. This mechanism prevents the group from getting permanently stuck in a sub-optimal defection cycle due to a single past transgression.
*   **Robustness for Sustainable Cooperation:** By protecting itself from exploitation (through defection when others defect) and allowing for recovery, FCR aims for a robust and sustainable path to collective welfare, rather than being a naive cooperator that would be easily exploited.

In summary, Forgiving Collective Reciprocity is a strategically sound approach that champions full group cooperation by being initially generous, strictly reciprocal (demanding full contribution), and forgiving (allowing recovery), while intelligently protecting itself in the face of inevitable game-theoretic challenges.

description_COLLECTIVE_123 = '''
The following strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC)", is designed to maximize collective welfare in the Public Goods Game while remaining robust to various opponent behaviors. It operates with a collective mindset, aiming to establish and sustain cooperation by being responsive to the group's contribution levels.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC)

**Internal State:**
The strategy maintains two internal variables that track the group's recent cooperation trends:
*   `cooperation_threshold`: A floating-point number representing the minimum proportion of cooperators required in the previous round for this player to contribute. It is initialized to `0.6`. This threshold will dynamically adjust.
*   `consecutive_high_cooperation_rounds`: An integer counter, initialized to `0`. It tracks how many consecutive rounds have shown very high group cooperation.
*   `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds`: An integer counter, initialized to `0`. It tracks how many consecutive rounds have shown very low group cooperation.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initialization Phase):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** Begin with a clear signal of willingness to cooperate. This attempts to establish a cooperative equilibrium from the outset and sets a positive tone for the game.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Cooperation Phase):**
    *   **Observe History:** At the start of each round `t` (from 2 up to `r-1`), the player observes the actions of all `n` players from the previous round `t-1`.
    *   Calculate `P_prev = (total number of contributions in round t-1) / n`. This represents the proportion of cooperators in the last round.

    *   **Adjust `cooperation_threshold` (Adaptation and Responsiveness):**
        *   **Scenario A: Sustained High Cooperation (Forgiveness/Encouragement)**
            *   If `P_prev` was **greater than or equal to `0.9`** (indicating very high group cooperation):
                *   Increment `consecutive_high_cooperation_rounds`.
                *   Reset `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds` to `0`.
                *   If `consecutive_high_cooperation_rounds` has reached `3` or more:
                    *   Decrement `cooperation_threshold` by `0.05`.
                    *   Ensure `cooperation_threshold` does not fall below `0.3` (minimum leniency).
                    *   Reset `consecutive_high_cooperation_rounds` to `0` to require another period of sustained high cooperation before further lowering the threshold.
            *   *Reasoning:* When the group consistently demonstrates strong cooperation, the strategy becomes slightly more lenient, making it easier to maintain cooperation even with minor deviations. This encourages continued collective action.

        *   **Scenario B: Sustained Low Cooperation (Firmness/Protection)**
            *   If `P_prev` was **less than or equal to `0.3`** (indicating very low group cooperation):
                *   Increment `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds`.
                *   Reset `consecutive_high_cooperation_rounds` to `0`.
                *   If `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds` has reached `3` or more:
                    *   Increment `cooperation_threshold` by `0.05`.
                    *   Ensure `cooperation_threshold` does not exceed `0.8` (maximum strictness).
                    *   Reset `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds` to `0` to require another period of sustained low cooperation before further increasing the threshold.
            *   *Reasoning:* If the group consistently fails to cooperate sufficiently, the strategy becomes stricter. It demands a higher level of cooperation from others before contributing, protecting itself from exploitation and signaling that widespread defection is unsustainable for the collective.

        *   **Scenario C: Moderate Cooperation:**
            *   If `0.3 < P_prev < 0.9`:
                *   Reset `consecutive_high_cooperation_rounds` to `0`.
                *   Reset `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds` to `0`.
                *   The `cooperation_threshold` remains unchanged.
            *   *Reasoning:* Maintain the current stance when cooperation is within an expected range, preventing overreaction to normal fluctuations.

    *   **Decision for current round `t`:**
        *   If `P_prev` (from round `t-1`) is **greater than or equal to `cooperation_threshold`**, then **Contribute (C)**.
        *   Else (if `P_prev` is less than `cooperation_threshold`), then **Defect (D)**.
        *   *Reasoning:* This is the core conditional cooperation mechanism. The player contributes if the group showed sufficient cooperation in the previous round, otherwise, it withholds contribution.

3.  **Round `r` (Last Round - End Game):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions that can be influenced. Backward induction dictates that individual rationality prevails, making defection the dominant strategy for every player. This decision protects the player from being exploited by others who are also likely to defect.

**Collective Alignment Summary:**
The Adaptive Collective Contributor (ACC) strategy is designed with a strong collective alignment. It proactively attempts to initiate cooperation (Round 1), then adaptively fosters it by rewarding sustained high contributions with increased leniency (lowering its threshold) and by demanding higher cooperation when the collective contribution is consistently low (raising its threshold). This balance of generosity and firmness aims to guide the group towards and maintain the social optimum of full cooperation for as long as possible, only resorting to defection in the face of persistent collective failure or at the unavoidable end-game. It does not punish specific individuals but rather responds to the overall collective behavior.

description_COLLECTIVE_124 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Proportional Reciprocity," is designed to foster and maintain cooperation in the Public Goods Game by adaptively responding to the collective behavior observed in previous rounds, while also protecting itself from persistent exploitation.

### Adaptive Proportional Reciprocity Strategy

**1. Decision Rules**

This strategy dictates whether to Contribute (C) or Defect (D) based on the current round number (`t`), the total number of rounds (`r`), the number of players (`n`), the multiplier (`k`), and the observed history of contributions.

*   **Determine the Cooperation Threshold:**
    *   Calculate `T_coop = 1 / k`.
    *   *(Rationale: This threshold dynamically adjusts to the efficiency of the public good. If `k` is high (more efficient public good), `T_coop` is low, meaning the strategy is more forgiving and requires fewer cooperators to continue contributing. If `k` is low (less efficient), `T_coop` is high, requiring a larger proportion of cooperators to justify continued contribution. This links cooperation directly to the collective benefit potential.)*

*   **Rule for Round 1 (Initial Gesture):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   *(Rationale: Starting with cooperation signals a willingness to build a cooperative equilibrium and gives the group an initial opportunity to achieve high collective payoffs. It acts as an optimistic first move.)*

*   **Rule for Rounds 2 to (r-1) (Adaptive Response):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t`, observe the contributions of all `n` players from the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculate:** Determine the `proportion_of_cooperators_prev_round` by summing all contributions in round `t-1` and dividing by `n`.
    *   **Conditional Action:**
        *   If `proportion_of_cooperators_prev_round` is greater than or equal to `T_coop`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   *(Rationale: The observed level of collective cooperation is deemed sufficient to continue contributing, as it meets or exceeds the minimum efficiency standard set by `T_coop`.)*
        *   Else (`proportion_of_cooperators_prev_round` is less than `T_coop`):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   *(Rationale: The observed level of collective cooperation is insufficient. Defecting serves as a punishment for free-riding and an attempt to induce future cooperation by demonstrating that collective defection will be met with individual defection, thus minimizing losses.)*

*   **Rule for Round r (Final Round - Edge Case):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   *(Rationale: In the final round, there are no future interactions for reputation or reciprocity to matter. According to backward induction, the individually rational choice is to defect and free-ride, as there are no consequences for future rounds. This ensures the strategy is not exploited in the end-game.)*

**2. Handling Edge Cases**

*   **First Round (`t=1`):** The strategy proactively contributes to initiate cooperation and test the environment for collective willingness.
*   **Last Round (`t=r`):** The strategy defects, adhering to the standard game-theoretic reasoning for finite repeated games, where future incentives cease to exist.
*   **Intermediate Rounds (`t=2` to `r-1`):** The strategy uses the adaptive mechanism described above, continuously evaluating the collective's performance and adjusting its contribution behavior accordingly.

**3. Collective Alignment**

This strategy is inherently collective in its design by:

*   **Initiating Cooperation:** The first-round contribution serves as an optimistic attempt to establish a cooperative environment beneficial to all.
*   **Responsive Reciprocity:** It explicitly links individual contribution decisions to the observed collective effort. By cooperating when the group's cooperation rate is above `T_coop`, it rewards collective action. By defecting when it falls below, it punishes free-riding, aiming to steer the group back towards a more cooperative and mutually beneficial state.
*   **Efficiency-Based Threshold:** The `T_coop = 1/k` threshold directly incorporates the game's efficiency parameter (`k`). This means the strategy's tolerance for free-riding is adjusted based on how impactful each individual contribution is to the collective pool. This allows the strategy to be more lenient when the public good is highly efficient, thus promoting greater overall collective gain, and more stringent when it's less efficient, preventing wasteful individual contributions.
*   **Robustness:** While aiming for collective good, the strategy is not blindly cooperative. It protects itself from persistent exploitation by defecting when collective cooperation dwindles, ensuring it remains robust in a tournament setting with diverse and potentially exploitative opponents.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_125 = '''
Strategy Name: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)

**Description:**
The Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR) strategy aims to foster and sustain collective cooperation within the Public Goods Game. It operates on the principle of conditional cooperation: demonstrating an initial willingness to contribute and then adapting its behavior based on the observed collective contribution level of the group in previous rounds. This approach seeks to maximize collective welfare when possible, while pragmatically protecting against exploitation when collective contributions are insufficient.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: The multiplier for the public good (where `1 < k < n`).

**Internal State (per player, per game):**
*   **`CooperationThreshold`**: An integer value calculated once at the beginning of the game as `ceil(n / k)`. This threshold represents the minimum total number of contributions required from *all players* in a given round for this strategy to consider the group's cooperation level sufficient to warrant its own contribution in the *next* round.

    *   *Rationale for `CooperationThreshold`*: This threshold signifies the point at which the total benefit generated by the public good (`k * total_contributions`) equals or exceeds the total initial endowment across all players (`n * 1`). If the group consistently meets or exceeds this threshold, it suggests a sustainable collective effort where the public good effectively regenerates or grows the initial investment made by the players.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Initiate cooperation and signal a willingness to contribute to the public good. This provides an initial opportunity for the collective to observe the benefits of cooperation and encourages others to follow suit.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`):**
    *   **Information Gathering:** At the beginning of each intermediate round, the strategy observes `C_previous`, which is the total number of contributions made by *all players* (including itself) in the immediately preceding round.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   If `C_previous >= CooperationThreshold`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** The collective has demonstrated a sufficient level of cooperation, indicating a potentially beneficial environment for collective action. This strategy reciprocates by contributing to sustain the collective benefit.
        *   Else (`C_previous < CooperationThreshold`):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** The collective's contribution level has fallen below the threshold, indicating insufficient cooperation or a risk of exploitation. The strategy defects to protect its own endowment and to signal that a higher level of collective effort is required for its continued cooperation.

3.  **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite game, there are no future interactions or rounds to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. The individually rational choice is to defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no long-term consequences.

**Example Calculation of `CooperationThreshold`:**
*   **Scenario 1: `n=4`, `k=2`**
    *   `CooperationThreshold = ceil(4 / 2) = 2`. The strategy will contribute if 2 or more players contributed in the previous round.
*   **Scenario 2: `n=10`, `k=1.1`**
    *   `CooperationThreshold = ceil(10 / 1.1) = ceil(9.09) = 10`. The strategy will contribute only if all 10 players contributed in the previous round (a very high bar, reflecting the very low collective return from `k=1.1`).
*   **Scenario 3: `n=10`, `k=9`**
    *   `CooperationThreshold = ceil(10 / 9) = ceil(1.11) = 2`. The strategy will contribute if 2 or more players contributed in the previous round (a relatively low bar, reflecting the high collective return from `k=9`).

This strategy offers a balanced approach, seeking to achieve collective welfare through conditional cooperation while remaining adaptive and robust against various opponent behaviors by avoiding continuous exploitation.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_126 = '''
This strategy is designed for an individual AI player within the Public Goods Game, aiming to foster collective cooperation while remaining robust and adaptive to diverse opponent behaviors. It balances the collective good with individual self-preservation, particularly in a finite repeated game.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Reciprocity (AR)

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `Cooperation_Threshold`: A fixed proportion (between 0 and 1) representing the minimum average contribution level required from the collective in the previous round for this strategy to contribute. A commonly effective value is **0.6 (or 60%)**. This means if at least 60% of players contributed in the previous round, this strategy will contribute.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   **Reasoning:** Initiate cooperation and signal a willingness to contribute to the collective good. This sets a baseline for potential cooperation.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   **Information Used:** Observe `S_prev`, the total number of contributions across all `n` players in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `(S_prev / n) >= Cooperation_Threshold`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   **Reasoning:** The collective demonstrated a sufficient level of cooperation (at or above the threshold). This strategy reciprocates by contributing, thereby rewarding collective cooperation and reinforcing the positive dynamic.
        *   **Else (`(S_prev / n) < Cooperation_Threshold`):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**
            *   **Reasoning:** The collective level of cooperation was below the acceptable threshold. Defecting serves as a proportionate punishment to discourage free-riding and signals that higher levels of contribution are expected to restore cooperation.

3.  **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. The individually rational (dominant) strategy is to defect to maximize personal gain without consequence.

---

**Alignment with Collective Mindset:**

*   **Initiates Cooperation:** The strategy starts by contributing, taking the first step towards collective benefit.
*   **Rewards Collective Effort:** It maintains cooperation when others contribute sufficiently, reinforcing positive collective behavior.
*   **Discourages Free-Riding:** It defects when collective contributions fall, providing an incentive for others to increase their cooperation.
*   **Adaptive Recovery:** By basing decisions on the previous round's contributions, the strategy allows for the re-establishment of cooperation if collective contributions recover after a period of defection.
*   **Robustness:** The threshold-based approach allows it to tolerate some level of individual defection without immediately collapsing, while being firm enough to react to widespread free-riding. The final round defection ensures robustness against exploitation when the "shadow of the future" disappears.
'''

description_COLLECTIVE_127 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR)", is designed to foster and sustain collective cooperation in the Public Goods Game. It operates with a collective mindset, aiming to establish and maintain a high level of contributions by being responsive to observed cooperation levels while protecting against persistent exploitation.

---

### **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity (ACR) Strategy**

**Core Principle:** ACR endeavors to achieve and maintain a state of widespread contribution. It initiates cooperation to signal willingness, then adaptively responds to the collective behavior observed in prior rounds. It tolerates a minor level of defection but punishes significant free-riding to incentivize a return to collective effort.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Stance):**
    *   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Start with an optimistic signal of willingness to contribute. This attempts to establish a cooperative baseline for the collective and explore the potential for mutual benefit.

2.  **Rounds 2 through `r-1` (Adaptive Response):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of each round `t` (where `2 <= t <= r-1`), observe the actions of all `n` players in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`). Let `m_{t-1}` be the total number of players who contributed 1 token in round `t-1`.
    *   **Cooperation Threshold:**
        *   **If `m_{t-1} > n / 2` (Majority Cooperation):**
            *   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If a clear majority of players (more than half) demonstrated cooperation in the previous round, continue to contribute. This reinforces the cooperative norm, signals a sustained commitment to collective welfare, and allows for a minority of defectors without triggering immediate collapse. It encourages continued widespread cooperation.
        *   **Else (`m_{t-1} <= n / 2`, Insufficient Cooperation):**
            *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If cooperation falls to or below a critical majority threshold, defect. This serves as a collective punishment for insufficient contributions, signaling that widespread free-riding will not be tolerated and aims to pressure players back towards cooperation by demonstrating that collective defection is detrimental to everyone.

3.  **Round `r` (Final Round):**
    *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions or potential for reputation building to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. Therefore, the individually rational action is to defect, regardless of past history, as predicted by backward induction.

*   **Varying `n`:** The `n/2` threshold dynamically scales with the number of players, making it robust across different group sizes. For `n=2`, it effectively becomes a Tit-for-Tat-like strategy (cooperate if both contributed, defect otherwise).
*   **Varying `k`:** The threshold is primarily based on the proportion of cooperators rather than direct `k`-based payoff calculations. This acknowledges that in a repeated game, the strategy's primary role is to establish and maintain a cooperative social norm, which is beneficial for any `1 < k < n`, rather than optimizing for single-round gains which would always lead to defection.
*   **Opponent Strategies:**
    *   **Against always-cooperate (AC):** ACR will cooperate fully, achieving high collective and individual payoffs.
    *   **Against always-defect (AD):** ACR will contribute in Round 1, then quickly switch to defecting, minimizing losses after the initial probe.
    *   **Against conditional cooperators (e.g., other ACRs or Tit-for-Tat variants):** ACR's initial cooperation and adaptive majority rule are likely to lead to sustained mutual cooperation, resulting in high collective payoffs.
    *   **Against mixed or exploitative strategies:** The majority threshold provides a degree of forgiveness for minor deviations but is firm enough to deter persistent free-riding, aiming to re-establish cooperation if possible.

This strategy balances a desire for collective welfare with a practical need for self-protection against exploitation in a tournament setting.

description_COLLECTIVE_128 = '''
This strategy, named **Adaptive Collective Reciprocity**, aims to foster and sustain cooperation within the Public Goods Game by dynamically adjusting its behavior based on the observed collective contribution level, while remaining robust to defection and mindful of the game's finite nature.

The core idea is to contribute when the group demonstrates a sufficiently high level of cooperation, and to defect when cooperation falls short, thereby punishing free-riders and incentivizing a return to collective effort.

---

**Strategy: Adaptive Collective Reciprocity**

This strategy dictates actions for each player in each round, based on the game parameters (`n`, `r`, `k`) and the history of play.

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Decision:** Contribute (C).
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution serves to establish a cooperative baseline. It signals a willingness to engage in collective effort and "tests the waters" for potential reciprocal behavior from other players in the group.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to r-1):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of each intermediate round `t` (where `1 < t < r`), observe the total number of contributions made by all players in the *previous* round (`t-1`). Let this be `N_C_prev = sum_j c_j_prev`.
    *   **Cooperation Threshold Calculation:** Determine the dynamic cooperation threshold `T`. This threshold represents the minimum total number of contributions required from the group in the previous round to warrant continued cooperation from this strategy. The threshold is calculated as:
        `T = ceil(k)`
        *   *Explanation of `T`*: This threshold scales with the multiplier `k`. When `k` is small (meaning the public good is relatively weak and individual defection is highly profitable), `T` will be low, making the strategy more forgiving and lowering the bar for continued cooperation. When `k` is large (meaning the public good is strong and the individual cost of cooperation is low), `T` will be high, demanding a greater level of collective effort to sustain cooperation. This makes the strategy adaptively stricter or more lenient based on the inherent "ease" or "difficulty" of maintaining cooperation in the given game parameters.
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   If `N_C_prev >= T`: **Contribute (C).**
            *   *Rationale:* The group's previous round contributions met or exceeded the established threshold. This indicates sufficient collective effort, justifying continued contribution to reward past cooperation and encourage its perpetuation, thereby fostering the collective good.
        *   Else (`N_C_prev < T`): **Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* The group's previous round contributions fell below the threshold. This signals an insufficient collective effort or a prevalence of free-riding. Defecting in response serves as a punishment, incentivizes a return to higher cooperation, and protects this strategy from sustained exploitation.

3.  **Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Decision:** Defect (D).
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no subsequent interactions to influence through reciprocal actions, punishment, or reward. The individually rational and dominant strategy, derived from backward induction, is to defect to maximize immediate personal payoff. Any contribution would be a purely altruistic act that would be exploited by rational opponents.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_1 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Free-Rider with Revival Mechanic," is designed to be highly exploitative in the Public Goods Game. It prioritizes maximizing individual payoff by largely defecting and free-riding on the contributions of others. It only strategically contributes under specific, controlled conditions to "re-seed" cooperation if it collapses, aiming to create future opportunities for exploitation.

**Strategy Parameters:**

*   **`Exploitation_Threshold = 0.4`**: If the proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round is at or above this value, the strategy will defect to free-ride.
*   **`Revival_Threshold = 0.1`**: If the proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round falls below this value, the strategy will consider a strategic contribution (if cooldown allows).
*   **`Revival_Cooldown = max(3, floor(n/3))`**: The minimum number of rounds this strategy must have defected before it considers contributing again for revival. This prevents it from being consistently exploited.
*   **`Endgame_Rounds = max(1, floor(r/4))`**: The number of final rounds in the game where the strategy will unconditionally defect due to backward induction.

**Strategy State (maintained throughout the game):**

*   **`rounds_since_my_last_contribution`**: An integer counter, initialized to 0. It tracks how many consecutive rounds this strategy has defected since its last contribution.

---

**Decision Rules (for current round `t`):**

1.  **Initialization (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **State Update:** Set `rounds_since_my_last_contribution = 1`.

2.  **Endgame Phase (Rounds `r - Endgame_Rounds + 1` to `r`):**
    *   If the current round `t` is greater than `r - Endgame_Rounds`:
        *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**. There are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation, so individual rationality dictates defection.
        *   **State Update:** Increment `rounds_since_my_last_contribution` by 1.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (Rounds 2 to `r - Endgame_Rounds`):**
    *   Let `N_others_contributed_last_round` be the total number of *other players* who contributed in the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   Calculate the **Average Peer Contribution Rate (APCR)**: `APCR = N_others_contributed_last_round / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Condition A: Sufficient Cooperation (Exploitation Opportunity):**
        *   If `APCR >= Exploitation_Threshold`:
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**. A significant number of others are contributing, providing a clear opportunity to free-ride and maximize personal gain.
            *   **State Update:** Increment `rounds_since_my_last_contribution` by 1.

    *   **Condition B: Collapsing Cooperation (Strategic Revival or Continued Defection):**
        *   Else (meaning `APCR < Exploitation_Threshold`):
            *   If `APCR < Revival_Threshold` (cooperation is very low, close to collapse) **AND** `rounds_since_my_last_contribution >= Revival_Cooldown` (the strategy has defected for a sufficient period, preventing it from being an easy target for exploitation):
                *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**. This is a calculated, strategic investment. The aim is not genuine cooperation, but to stimulate a return to higher cooperation levels in the group, which can then be exploited in future rounds.
                *   **State Update:** Reset `rounds_since_my_last_contribution = 0`.
            *   Else (cooperation is moderate OR the strategy has contributed too recently to consider another revival attempt):
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
                *   **State Update:** Increment `rounds_since_my_last_contribution` by 1.

---

**Rationale for Exploitative Nature:**

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy's primary mode is to defect, maximizing its immediate payoff whenever possible.
*   **Threshold-Based Free-Riding:** It actively monitors and leverages existing levels of cooperation from others. If enough players are contributing, it reliably defects to capture the benefits without incurring personal cost.
*   **Calculated "Cooperation" for Future Exploitation:** Any contribution made by this strategy is not out of a desire for collective welfare but a cold, strategic move to prevent the complete collapse of the public good. By making a rare contribution when cooperation is critically low, it attempts to "prime the pump" and encourage others to contribute more, thus creating a larger pool for future free-riding.
*   **Self-Preservation and Cooldowns:** The `Revival_Cooldown` is crucial. It ensures that the strategy doesn't become a predictable "sucker," protecting itself from being exploited by other adaptive or exploitative agents.
*   **Unconditional Endgame Defection:** It exploits the finite horizon of the game by defecting without exception in the final rounds, extracting maximum value when future repercussions are irrelevant.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_2 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Opportunist," is designed to maximize individual payoff by predominantly free-riding on the contributions of others. It strategically contributes only when necessary to prevent a complete collapse of the public good or to maintain unpredictability, always reverting to defection when opportunities arise.

**Strategy: The Adaptive Opportunist**

**Core Principle:** Prioritize free-riding. Only contribute strategically when it's necessary to maintain or revive the public good *from which I benefit*, or to keep opponents guessing.

**Internal State Variables (Initialized before Round 1):**
*   `my_previous_action`: Stores my action (Contribute or Defect) in the immediately preceding round. Initialize as `Defect` for Round 1's subsequent calculations.
*   `my_defection_streak`: Counts consecutive rounds where I chose to Defect. Initialize as `0`.

**Decision Rules (For each Round `current_round` from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Last Round Exploitation (Round `r`):**
    *   If `current_round == r`:
        *   **Action:** Choose **Defect (D)**.
        *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. Maximizing immediate personal gain by keeping the endowment is the dominant strategy.

2.  **Adaptive Behavior (Rounds 1 to `r-1`):**

    *   **Step A: Observation and Update (for `current_round > 1`):**
        *   Determine `others_contributions_prev_round`: Count how many *other players* contributed (1) in the previous round. This is calculated as `total_contributions_in_prev_round - (1 if my_previous_action == Contribute else 0)`.
        *   Calculate `others_avg_contribution_rate`: `others_contributions_prev_round / (n - 1)`. (Ranges from 0 to 1).
        *   Update `my_defection_streak`: If `my_previous_action` was `Defect`, increment `my_defection_streak`. Otherwise (if `my_previous_action` was `Contribute`), reset `my_defection_streak = 0`.

    *   **Step B: Decision for the `current_round`:**

        *   **B1. First Round Probe (`current_round == 1`):**
            *   **Action:** Choose **Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* Start by testing the environment for free-riding opportunities and identifying potential unconditional cooperators.
            *   *After action:* Set `my_previous_action = Defect`.

        *   **B2. No Public Good to Leverage (`current_round > 1`):**
            *   If `others_contributions_prev_round == 0` (i.e., no other player contributed in the previous round):
                *   **Action:** Choose **Defect (D)**.
                *   *Rationale:* If no one else is contributing, my contribution of 1 token provides me with only `k/n` (since `k/n < 1`), resulting in a net loss. There is no public good to leverage in this scenario.
                *   *After action:* Set `my_previous_action = Defect`.

        *   **B3. High Cooperation Observed (Optimal Free-Ride, `current_round > 1`):**
            *   If `others_avg_contribution_rate >= 0.7`:
                *   **Action:** Choose **Defect (D)**.
                *   *Rationale:* When a high percentage of others are contributing, the public good is robust. This is the optimal time to aggressively free-ride and maximize my personal gain from their generosity.
                *   *After action:* Set `my_previous_action = Defect`.

        *   **B4. Critically Low Cooperation (Strategic Investment, `current_round > 1`):**
            *   If `others_avg_contribution_rate < 0.3`:
                *   **AND** `my_defection_streak >= 3`:
                    *   **Action:** Choose **Contribute (C)**.
                    *   *Rationale:* When contributions are critically low and I have been defecting for a sustained period, it's possible I am perceived as a reason for the low cooperation. A temporary contribution acts as a "primer" or "signal" to conditional cooperators, attempting to revive the public good which ultimately benefits me. This is a calculated risk to prevent a complete collapse into universal defection.
                    *   *After action:* Set `my_previous_action = Contribute`.

        *   **B5. Moderate Cooperation / Long Defection (Maintain Ambiguity, `current_round > 1`):**
            *   If `0.3 <= others_avg_contribution_rate < 0.7`:
                *   **AND** `my_defection_streak >= 5`:
                    *   **Action:** Choose **Contribute (C)** with a **30% probability**. Otherwise (70% probability), choose **Defect (D)**.
                    *   *Rationale:* When others show moderate cooperation, but I've been defecting for a very long time, a completely predictable defection might lead others to give up or coordinate against me. Introducing a small, unpredictable chance of contribution can keep opponents guessing, prevent complete retaliatory defection, and maintain a tenuous level of cooperation from which I can benefit.
                    *   *After action:* Set `my_previous_action` based on the chosen action.

        *   **B6. Default Behavior (Free-Ride, `current_round > 1`):**
            *   In all other cases not covered above (e.g., moderate cooperation and my defection streak is short):
                *   **Action:** Choose **Defect (D)**.
                *   *Rationale:* Continue the default free-riding behavior when no specific condition for strategic contribution is met.
                *   *After action:* Set `my_previous_action = Defect`.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_3 = '''
This strategy, named "Calculated Free-Rider," is designed to be highly exploitative in the Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize its own payoff by defaulting to defection, while judiciously making strategic contributions only when there is a calculated expectation of inducing or maintaining a higher level of cooperation from other players that can then be free-ridden upon. It is adaptive to opponent behavior and robust across various game parameters, including edge cases.

**Game Parameters and Internal State:**

*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (where `1 < k < n`).
*   `CurrentRound`: The current round number (from 1 to `r`).
*   `History`: A complete record of all players' actions (Contribute=1, Defect=0) and payoffs from all preceding rounds.
*   `MyLastAction`: The action taken by this strategy in the immediately preceding round (1 for Contribute, 0 for Defect).
*   `OthersCooperationRate_ShortTerm`: The average contribution rate of *other* players over the last `N_short` rounds.
    *   `N_short`: The window size for short-term observation (e.g., `max(2, min(n, 5))` rounds).
*   `OthersCooperationRate_LongTerm`: The average contribution rate of *other* players over the last `N_long` rounds.
    *   `N_long`: The window size for long-term observation (e.g., `max(5, min(r/2, 2*n))` rounds).
*   `ReseedAttemptsCount`: A counter for the number of times this strategy has made a "re-seed" contribution (an attempt to restore failing cooperation).
*   `MaxReseedAttempts`: A hard limit on the total number of re-seed attempts permitted (e.g., `min(r / 5, 3)`). This prevents the strategy from becoming a "martyr."

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Pre-Game Check (Extreme `k/n` Ratio):**
    *   If `(k / n) < 0.2`: The individual incentive to defect (`1 - k/n`) is overwhelmingly strong, making sustained cooperation highly improbable. Attempts to foster cooperation are likely futile and costly.
    *   **Action:** **Always Defect (D)** from Round 1 for the entire game.

2.  **Initial Exploration Phase (Rounds 1 to `N_short`):**
    *   **Round 1:**
        *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**. This is a low-cost probe to identify conditional cooperators and potentially establish a baseline of cooperation that can be exploited.
    *   **Rounds 2 to `N_short`:**
        *   Calculate the average contribution rate of *other* players from the *immediately preceding round*. Let this be `LastRoundOthersAvgC = (sum of c_j for j != i in previous round) / (n-1)`.
        *   **If `LastRoundOthersAvgC >= 0.6` (i.e., a high level of immediate cooperation):**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**. Immediately begin free-riding on the established cooperation.
        *   **Else (i.e., moderate or low cooperation):**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**. Continue to attempt to build a cooperative environment, still within the "exploration" mindset.

3.  **Main Exploitation & Re-seeding Phase (Rounds `N_short + 1` to `r - max(1, n)`):**
    *   In each round of this phase, calculate `OthersCooperationRate_ShortTerm` and `OthersCooperationRate_LongTerm` based on `History`.

    *   **a) High Cooperation Detected (Aggressive Exploitation):**
        *   If `OthersCooperationRate_ShortTerm >= 0.6` (i.e., other players are contributing at a high rate):
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**. This is the prime opportunity to free-ride aggressively.

    *   **b) Low Cooperation Detected (Calculated Re-seeding):**
        *   Else if `OthersCooperationRate_ShortTerm < 0.2` (i.e., cooperation has significantly collapsed):
            *   **And `MyLastAction` was Defect (D):** (Only re-seed if we haven't just contributed)
            *   **And `ReseedAttemptsCount < MaxReseedAttempts`:** (Within our budget for re-seeding attempts)
            *   **And `OthersCooperationRate_LongTerm > 0.1`:** (There's a historical baseline of some cooperation, implying potential for recovery, not a fundamentally uncooperative group)
                *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**. This is a "re-seed" attempt to shock the system back into cooperation, hoping to create future free-riding opportunities. Increment `ReseedAttemptsCount`.
            *   **Else (conditions for re-seeding are not met or exhausted):**
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**. Cooperation is too low to be worth further investment, or re-seeding attempts have been exhausted. Cut losses.

    *   **c) Moderate Cooperation (Default to Defect):**
        *   Else (`0.2 <= OthersCooperationRate_ShortTerm < 0.6`):
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**. Prioritize free-riding. Only make a re-seed attempt when cooperation is critically low.

4.  **Endgame Phase (Rounds `r - max(1, n) + 1` to `r`):**
    *   In the final `max(1, n)` rounds, there is no future to incentivize cooperation, so the individual incentive to defect becomes overwhelmingly dominant.
    *   **Action:** **Always Defect (D)**. Irrespective of history or current cooperation levels.

Strategy Name: The Adaptive Opportunist

This strategy aims to maximize personal gain by strategically free-riding on the contributions of others. It carefully balances the desire to exploit with the need to prevent a complete collapse of cooperation, which would ultimately diminish its own payoff. It adapts its behavior based on observed cooperation levels and always optimizes for the final round.

**Parameters:**

*   `INITIAL_COOPERATE_ROUNDS = 2`: A fixed number of initial rounds during which the strategy attempts to establish a baseline of cooperation.
*   `EXPLOITATION_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE = 0.5`: The minimum proportion of players that must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to feel "safe" enough to defect. (e.g., if `n=10`, and 5 or more players contributed, this strategy will defect).
*   `MINIMUM_SUSTAINABLE_CONTRIBUTIONS = 1`: If the total number of contributors in the previous round falls to or below this absolute number, the strategy will assume cooperation has effectively collapsed and will not attempt to "re-prime" it.

**Decision Rules for Player i in Round `t` (where `r` is the total number of rounds):**

1.  **If `t` < `INITIAL_COOPERATE_ROUNDS` (Initial Assessment Phase):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the very first rounds, with no historical data, this strategy attempts to signal a willingness to cooperate. This initial investment aims to encourage other players to contribute, thereby establishing a foundation of collective good that can be exploited in later rounds. This phase is overridden by Rule 2 if `r` is extremely small (e.g., `r=1`).

2.  **If `t` == `r` (Final Round Exploitation):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the last round, there are no future interactions. Therefore, there is no strategic benefit or incentive to contribute. Defecting maximizes immediate payoff, as it captures the `1` token without any future consequences for cooperation.

3.  **If `INITIAL_COOPERATE_ROUNDS` <= `t` < `r` (Adaptive Exploitation Phase):**
    *   Observe the history of contributions from round `t-1`. Let `C_count_prev` be the *total number of players* (including `i` if `i` contributed) who contributed (C) in round `t-1`.

    *   **Sub-Rule 3a: Collapse Detected:**
        *   If `C_count_prev` <= `MINIMUM_SUSTAINABLE_CONTRIBUTIONS`:
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reasoning:** If cooperation has fallen to a critically low level, an individual contribution from this player is highly unlikely to revive it and would merely make this player a "sucker." At this point, the public good is effectively non-existent, and the strategy switches to pure self-interest.

    *   **Sub-Rule 3b: Exploit Strong Cooperation:**
        *   Else (`C_count_prev` > `MINIMUM_SUSTAINABLE_CONTRIBUTIONS`):
            *   Calculate the observed cooperation rate: `cooperation_rate_prev = C_count_prev / n`.
            *   If `cooperation_rate_prev` >= `EXPLOITATION_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE`:
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Reasoning:** A sufficient number of players are contributing, indicating a robust pool of collective good. This strategy capitalizes on this by defecting, securing an additional `1` token without (it assumes) causing a system collapse, as the remaining cooperators are numerous enough to sustain the public good.

    *   **Sub-Rule 3c: Re-Invest to Prevent Collapse:**
        *   Else (`cooperation_rate_prev` < `EXPLOITATION_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE`):
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Reasoning:** Cooperation is faltering but not yet at the `MINIMUM_SUSTAINABLE_CONTRIBUTIONS` level. A temporary contribution from this player attempts to prevent a complete breakdown, signaling a willingness to contribute when overall cooperation dips. This is a strategic investment to 're-prime' the collective good and maintain the potential for future free-riding.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_5 = '''
This strategy, named "The Opportunistic Leech," is designed to maximize individual payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of other players. It employs a minimal initial investment to "bait" others, then defaults to defection, only contributing strategically when the collective good is critically low to prevent its complete collapse and ensure future exploitation opportunities.

**Strategy Parameters:**

*   **`Reinvestment_Threshold = 0.20`**: This threshold represents the average cooperation rate of *other players* (i.e., percentage of non-self players contributing) over the recent past, below which this strategy will switch from defecting to contributing. A low value (20%) signifies a high tolerance for free-riding.
*   **`M_History_Window = 3`**: This defines the number of most recent rounds to consider when calculating the average cooperation rate of others. If fewer than `M_History_Window` rounds have passed, all available previous rounds are used for the calculation.

---

**Decision Rules (for player 'I'):**

1.  **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution serves as a minimal "bait" to encourage other players to contribute. It aims to establish a potential public good pool for subsequent exploitation, without immediately revealing the strategy's exploitative nature.

2.  **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future consequences or opportunities for further interaction. Defecting maximizes immediate payoff without any risk of punishment or jeopardizing future cooperation.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**
    *   **Monitor Others' Recent Cooperation:**
        *   Calculate `avg_other_coop_rate_recent`: This is the average contribution rate of *all other players* (excluding player 'I') over the past `min(t-1, M_History_Window)` rounds.
        *   *Calculation:* `avg_other_coop_rate_recent = (Sum of c_j for all players j!=i in the past min(t-1, M_History_Window) rounds) / ((n-1) * min(t-1, M_History_Window))`
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `avg_other_coop_rate_recent < Reinvestment_Threshold`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   *Rationale:* The public good is at a critically low level due to insufficient contributions from others. To prevent its complete collapse (which would diminish all players' payoffs, including this strategy's), a temporary "reinvestment" is made. This aims to signal a willingness to cooperate, hoping to induce others to increase their contributions and revive the public good for future exploitation.
        *   **Else (`avg_other_coop_rate_recent >= Reinvestment_Threshold`):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**
            *   *Rationale:* The public good is currently being sufficiently maintained by others. This strategy capitalizes on their contributions by free-riding (defecting) to maximize its individual payoff, without needing to contribute itself.

*   **Initial Cooperation Duration:** This strategy will unconditionally Cooperate (C) for the very first 2 rounds of the game (Round 1 and Round 2), *unless* the total number of rounds (`r`) is too short for this period to fully apply (see decision rules below). This initial cooperation serves to signal a willingness to contribute and to encourage other players to also contribute, creating a cooperative environment that can later be exploited.
*   **End-Game Defection Horizon:** The strategy will unconditionally Defect (D) for the last 3 rounds of the game (i.e., rounds `r-2`, `r-1`, and `r`). This horizon is chosen to exploit the "end-game effect" from backward induction, where the incentive to cooperate diminishes as the final round approaches.
*   **Re-seeding Cooperation Threshold:** In the dynamic phase, if the average contribution rate from *all other players* in the previous round drops below **30%**, the strategy will temporarily Cooperate (C). This threshold is set low enough to detect a significant decline in overall cooperation but high enough to justify a strategic "re-investment" in building it back up.

**Decision Rules:**

The strategy evaluates the following rules in order of precedence:

1.  **Absolute Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* There are no further rounds to influence. The individually rational action is to keep the token, maximizing immediate payoff regardless of others' actions or the state of cooperation.

2.  **Penultimate Rounds (Round `r-2` and `r-1`):**
    *   If the current round is `r-2` or `r-1`:
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
        *   *Rationale:* Extending the logic of backward induction, cooperation in these final rounds offers little to no strategic benefit for future interactions, making defection the optimal choice.

3.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action: Cooperate (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution is a crucial step to encourage others to contribute. Starting with defection often leads to universal defection, leaving no cooperation to exploit in subsequent rounds. This rule applies only if Round 1 is not already covered by Rule 1 (i.e., if `r > 1`).

4.  **Second Round (Round 2):**
    *   If the current round is `2` (and not already covered by Rule 1 or 2):
        *   **Action: Cooperate (C)**.
        *   *Rationale:* Continues to reinforce the initial signal of cooperation and builds a stronger foundation for a cooperative environment.

5.  **Main Exploitation and Re-seeding Phase (All other rounds not covered by the above rules):**
    *   In these intermediate rounds, the strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of other players in the previous round.

    *   **Step 1: Calculate Previous Round's Other Contributions.**
        *   Determine `C_others_prev`: The sum of contributions from *all other players* in the immediately preceding round (`current_round - 1`).
        *   Calculate `average_other_contribution_rate = C_others_prev / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Step 2: Check for Re-seeding Opportunity.**
        *   If `average_other_contribution_rate < 0.3` (less than 30% of other players contributed in the previous round):
            *   **Action: Cooperate (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* The level of cooperation from others has dropped too low to effectively free-ride. By temporarily contributing, the strategy aims to "re-seed" cooperation and encourage other players to contribute more in future rounds, thereby rebuilding an environment conducive to future exploitation. This is a strategic, short-term investment.

    *   **Step 3: Exploit if Sufficient Cooperation.**
        *   Otherwise (if `average_other_contribution_rate >= 0.3`):
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* There is a sufficient level of cooperation from other players. The strategy capitalizes on this by defecting, keeping its own token, and still benefiting from the contributions of others. This is the primary exploitative action.

**Summary of Exploitative Alignment:**

*   **Strategic Cooperation:** The strategy uses initial cooperation and occasional "re-seeding" cooperation not out of altruism, but as a calculated investment to cultivate an environment where others contribute, which it can then exploit.
*   **Free-Riding Core:** In the main phase, the default action is to defect, specifically when others are contributing enough to make free-riding profitable. This directly maximizes individual gain at the expense of collective welfare.
*   **End-Game Selfishness:** The unwavering defection in the final rounds ensures that any remaining opportunity for personal gain is seized without concern for future consequences, aligning perfectly with an exploitative mindset.
*   **Adaptability and Robustness:** By dynamically reacting to the level of cooperation from others, the strategy remains effective against a wide range of opponent behaviors, from consistent cooperators (which it exploits heavily) to strong defectors (where it minimizes its own losses after a brief re-seeding attempt).

Strategy Name: Adaptive Free-Rider with Endgame Exploitation

This strategy is designed to maximize its own payoff by strategically leveraging periods of cooperation from other players, while minimizing its own contributions. It adapts to observed behavior, using limited "bait" contributions to encourage others, but primarily defaults to free-riding and always defects in the game's final stages.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (not directly used in decision rules, but part of game context)

**Internal Strategy Parameters (tuned based on game parameters, default values provided):**
*   `initial_bait_duration`: The number of opening rounds during which the strategy will contribute (C) to signal potential cooperation. (Default: `max(1, min(3, floor(r/4)))` rounds. For instance, 3 rounds for typical `r`).
*   `endgame_horizon`: The number of final rounds during which the strategy will always defect (D). (Default: `max(1, min(3, floor(r/4)))` rounds. For instance, 3 rounds for typical `r`).
*   `cooperation_threshold_others`: The minimum number of *other players* who must have contributed in the immediately preceding round for this strategy to feel confident enough to free-ride. (Default: `max(1, floor((n-1) / 2))`. For example, if `n=5`, this is 2; if `n=2`, this is 1).
*   `max_bait_attempts_if_low_cooperation`: The maximum number of consecutive rounds this strategy will contribute (C) when observed cooperation from others is low, before giving up on re-baiting and defaulting to defection. (Default: 2 rounds).

**Internal State Variable (initialized at the start of the game):**
*   `my_consecutive_bait_contributions`: An integer counter, initialized to 0. This tracks how many times this strategy has contributed consecutively in the adaptive phase when cooperation from others was low.

**Decision Rule for Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Endgame Override (Highest Priority):**
    *   If the current round `t` is greater than `r - endgame_horizon`:
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**
        *   Rationale: In the final rounds of the game, there is no future to influence, and no long-term benefit to cooperation. The strategy maximizes immediate payoff by exploiting the dominant strategy.
        *   Reset `my_consecutive_bait_contributions` to 0.

2.  **Initial Bait Phase (Medium Priority):**
    *   Else if the current round `t` is less than or equal to `initial_bait_duration`:
        *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
        *   Rationale: This initial contribution serves as a "bait" to encourage other players to contribute, signaling a willingness to cooperate. The goal is to build up a shared pool that this strategy can later free-ride on.
        *   Reset `my_consecutive_bait_contributions` to 0.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (Lowest Priority, if not in endgame or initial bait):**
    *   Observe the history from the previous round (`t-1`). Count the `num_others_contributed_last_round`, which is the total number of *other players* (excluding this strategy) who contributed in round `t-1`.
    *   **If `num_others_contributed_last_round` is greater than or equal to `cooperation_threshold_others`:**
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**
        *   Rationale: Sufficient cooperation from other players is observed. The strategy will free-ride on their contributions, maximizing its own payoff without contributing.
        *   Reset `my_consecutive_bait_contributions` to 0.
    *   **Else (`num_others_contributed_last_round` is less than `cooperation_threshold_others`):**
        *   **If `my_consecutive_bait_contributions` is less than `max_bait_attempts_if_low_cooperation`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   Rationale: Cooperation from others is currently low. This strategy will make a strategic, temporary investment by contributing. This acts as a "re-bait" attempt to stimulate and revive cooperation among other players, hoping to create a larger pool for future free-riding opportunities.
            *   Increment `my_consecutive_bait_contributions`.
        *   **Else (`my_consecutive_bait_contributions` is greater than or equal to `max_bait_attempts_if_low_cooperation`):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**
            *   Rationale: Multiple attempts to "re-bait" and stimulate cooperation have not yielded sufficient results. The strategy ceases its investment, as further contributions would be unproductive, and defaults to defection.
            *   Reset `my_consecutive_bait_contributions` to 0 (this allows for a fresh re-bait cycle if cooperation from others ever naturally recovers later).
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_8 = '''
The goal of this strategy is to be exploitative: maximize its own payoff by free-riding on others' contributions whenever possible, while strategically contributing only to prevent the collapse of the public good, which would eliminate future exploitation opportunities.

**Strategy Name:** Calculated Free-Rider

**Game Parameters:** `n` (number of players), `r` (number of rounds), `k` (multiplier, where `1 < k < n`).

**Internal State (per player):**
*   `my_previous_actions`: A list storing this player's contribution (1) or defection (0) in each past round.
*   `other_players_previous_actions`: A list of lists, where each inner list stores the contributions of a specific other player in each past round.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round `r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action:** **DEFECT (contribute 0 tokens).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. The dominant strategy for a single round is to defect, as there is no penalty for taking your endowment and no benefit to contributing beyond your own share of the public good (which is less than the cost of contribution: `k/n < 1`).

2.  **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action:** **CONTRIBUTE (contribute 1 token).**
    *   **Rationale:** This initial contribution serves as a calculated investment. It acts as a "seed" to encourage other players to contribute, establishing a baseline of cooperation that this strategy can then exploit in subsequent rounds. An immediate defection might lead to a quick collapse of cooperation, reducing future free-riding opportunities.

3.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Intermediate Rounds):**

    *   **Step 1: Calculate Other Players' Average Contribution Rate.**
        *   For each of the `n-1` other players, calculate their individual average contribution rate over all completed rounds. This is `(total contributions by that player) / (current_round - 1)`.
        *   Then, calculate `Overall_Avg_Other_Contribution_Rate` as the average of these individual average contribution rates from all other players. This value will be between 0 (all others always defect) and 1 (all others always contribute).

    *   **Step 2: Apply Threshold-Based Decision Logic.**

        *   **Condition A: High Cooperation Detected (Exploit)**
            *   If `Overall_Avg_Other_Contribution_Rate >= 0.6` (i.e., 60% or more of potential contributions from others are being made):
                *   **Action:** **DEFECT (contribute 0 tokens).**
                *   **Rationale:** The environment is sufficiently cooperative. Other players are contributing enough to create a substantial public good. This is the primary free-riding opportunity; maximize personal gain by keeping the endowment and benefiting from others' contributions.

        *   **Condition B: Medium Cooperation Detected (Strategic Re-seeding)**
            *   If `0.3 <= Overall_Avg_Other_Contribution_Rate < 0.6` (i.e., cooperation is declining but not completely collapsed):
                *   **Action:** **CONTRIBUTE (contribute 1 token).**
                *   **Rationale:** Cooperation is in a precarious state. A strategic contribution here acts as a "probe" or an attempt to "re-seed" cooperation. By contributing, this strategy signals a willingness to cooperate, hoping to encourage other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds. The aim is to pull `Overall_Avg_Other_Contribution_Rate` back up towards the exploitable `0.6` threshold. This is a calculated investment to preserve future free-riding opportunities.

        *   **Condition C: Low Cooperation Detected (Cut Losses)**
            *   If `Overall_Avg_Other_Contribution_Rate < 0.3` (i.e., cooperation has largely collapsed):
                *   **Action:** **DEFECT (contribute 0 tokens).**
                *   **Rationale:** The level of cooperation is too low for a single contribution to make a meaningful difference. Contributing would likely be a wasted effort, as there is little public good to benefit from, and a single contribution is unlikely to turn the tide. In this scenario, cut losses and revert to pure self-interest.

**Exploitative Alignment:**

*   The strategy is inherently exploitative by primarily defaulting to defection when the collective contribution is high enough to be profitable (`Overall_Avg_Other_Contribution_Rate >= 0.6`).
*   Its contributions are not based on genuine reciprocity or a desire for collective welfare, but rather on a calculated effort to manipulate other players' behavior to maintain an exploitable pool of resources.
*   The initial contribution is a bait, and the "re-seeding" contributions are investments aimed at future free-riding, not cooperation for cooperation's sake.
*   The strategy minimizes personal contributions when the public good is too small to be worth investing in.

This strategy aims to be robust by adapting to different levels of cooperation among opponents, seeking to always operate within the most profitable zone for itself.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_9 = '''
**Strategy Name: The Opportunistic Leech**

This strategy is designed to be highly exploitative in the Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize individual payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others, only contributing when strategically necessary to prevent a collective collapse that would ultimately reduce its own gains, or to re-establish an exploitable environment. It is adaptive, robust against varying opponent behaviors, and relies solely on game parameters and observed history.

**Parameters:**

*   `initial_defection_rounds = 2`: The number of initial rounds to play Defect (D) to probe opponent reactions and establish an exploitative baseline.
*   `cooperation_recovery_threshold = 0.25`: If the average contribution rate of other players (in recent history) falls below this, the strategy considers a "grudging contribution" to prevent total collapse.
*   `recent_history_window = 3`: The number of most recent rounds to consider when calculating "recent" average contribution rates of other players.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 to `initial_defection_rounds` (Initial Probe Phase):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* This early defection serves to test the waters, establishing a clear intent to free-ride. It allows the strategy to gauge if opponents are "pushovers" who will continue to contribute despite being exploited, or if they react quickly to defection. It also sets a low baseline for this player's own contribution history.

2.  **Rounds `initial_defection_rounds + 1` to `r - 3` (Adaptive Exploitation Phase):**
    *   Let `current_round_number` be the present round.
    *   Calculate `average_others_contribution_rate_recent`: The average proportion of other players who contributed in the *last `recent_history_window` rounds*. (If fewer than `recent_history_window` rounds have passed since `initial_defection_rounds`, use all available previous rounds from this phase).
    *   Let `my_last_action` be the action taken by this strategy in the previous round.

    *   **Primary Rule: Defect (D).** The default action is always to Defect. The strategy will only switch to Cooperate (C) if a strong, self-serving condition is met to override this default.

    *   **Conditional Cooperation (Override for "Grudging Contribution"):**
        *   If `average_others_contribution_rate_recent` is below `cooperation_recovery_threshold` (indicating a significant drop in collective contributions that might hurt even the free-rider)
        *   **AND** `my_last_action` was Defect (D) (meaning this strategy has been free-riding and might need to make a minimal gesture to prevent further decay)
        *   **THEN: Action: Contribute (C).**
        *   *Rationale:* This is a calculated, "grudging contribution." It's not altruistic but a strategic investment to prevent a total breakdown of the public good that would eventually yield zero or minimal returns for all, including this strategy. By contributing sparingly and only when critical, it attempts to "re-seed" cooperation or halt its decline, hoping others will resume contributing more, allowing further exploitation. If this minimal contribution doesn't improve cooperation, the strategy will revert to defection.

3.  **Rounds `r - 2` to `r` (Endgame Phase):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final rounds, the "shadow of the future" disappears. There are no further opportunities to influence future behavior, and backward induction dictates that the individually rational choice is to defect to maximize immediate payoff, regardless of past actions or the actions of others.

**Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **Very Short Games (e.g., `r <= 3`):** The "Endgame Phase" rules will take precedence and cover most or all rounds. This naturally leads to an all-defection strategy, which is the Nash Equilibrium for a finite, unrepeated PGG, and thus optimal for short games where there's little scope for adaptive behavior or influencing future rounds.
*   **Fewer `recent_history_window` rounds available:** The calculation of `average_others_contribution_rate_recent` will simply use all available rounds in the Adaptive Exploitation Phase.

**Exploitative Alignment:**

*   **Default Free-Riding:** The core of the strategy is to default to defection, actively trying to benefit from others' generosity without contributing itself.
*   **Minimalist, Self-Serving Cooperation:** Cooperation is never a first choice. It's a calculated, temporary measure triggered only when the public good is on the verge of collapsing to a degree that it *harms this strategy's own potential payoff*. It's a tactical retreat from pure defection, not a shift in philosophy.
*   **Aggressive Defection when Conditions Allow:** When others are contributing sufficiently (above the `cooperation_recovery_threshold`, and this strategy isn't in a "recovery" mode), The Opportunistic Leech will unhesitatingly defect.
*   **No Altruism:** The strategy never contributes out of fairness or reciprocity, only out of a cold calculation of self-interest in a repeated context.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_10 = '''
The strategy is called "The Pragmatic Free-Rider." It is designed to be highly exploitative, consistently aiming to maximize its own payoff by free-riding on the contributions of others. However, it is pragmatic enough to make a calculated, temporary contribution if the collective pool of contributions is severely depleted, and there's sufficient game remaining to potentially revive the common good for future exploitation.

**Parameters (Example values are provided for clarity, actual values might be tuned):**
*   `critical_cooperation_threshold`: (e.g., 0.3, meaning 30%) - The percentage of *other* players contributing in the previous round below which the overall cooperation level is considered critically low. Below this, the game is "dying."
*   `reseed_rounds_remaining_minimum`: (e.g., `max(3, r / 4)`) - The minimum number of rounds that must remain in the game (including the current round) for a re-seeding attempt to be considered worthwhile. A re-seed is pointless if too few rounds are left to benefit.
*   `low_cooperation_streak_trigger`: (e.g., 2 rounds) - The number of *consecutive* rounds the average contribution from others must be below the `critical_cooperation_threshold` to trigger a re-seeding consideration. This prevents overreacting to single-round fluctuations.

**Internal State (maintained across rounds):**
*   `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds`: A counter that tracks how many consecutive rounds the average contribution from others has been below `critical_cooperation_threshold`. This counter resets to 0 if cooperation rises above the threshold.
*   `contributed_in_previous_round`: A boolean flag, true if this strategy contributed in the immediately preceding round, false otherwise. This prevents this strategy from contributing in back-to-back rounds without observing a positive response.

---

**Decision Logic for Current Round `R`:**

1.  **First Round (R = 1):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **State Update:** Set `contributed_in_previous_round = false`.
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy starts by observing the environment without taking any initial risks. It establishes a baseline of others' willingness to contribute.

2.  **Last Round (R = r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** Standard game-theoretic rationality dictates defecting in the final round. There are no future rounds to influence, so contributing would be a pure loss.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < R < r):**

    *   **Step 1: Assess Previous Round's Cooperation (Round `R-1`):**
        *   Calculate `C_others_prev`: The sum of contributions from all *other* players in round `R-1`.
        *   Calculate `Avg_C_others_prev = C_others_prev / (n-1)`: The average contribution rate of other players.

    *   **Step 2: Update `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds`:**
        *   If `Avg_C_others_prev` is less than `critical_cooperation_threshold`:
            *   Increment `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds` by 1.
        *   Else (`Avg_C_others_prev` is at or above `critical_cooperation_threshold`):
            *   Reset `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds` to 0.

    *   **Step 3: Determine Action for Current Round `R`:**

        *   **Default Action:** The strategy's primary stance is to Defect (contribute 0 tokens). This is the base action for exploitation.

        *   **Conditional "Re-seeding" Exception:** The strategy will consider making a temporary contribution (contribute 1 token) ONLY if **all** of the following conditions are met:
            *   `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds` is greater than or equal to `low_cooperation_streak_trigger` (i.e., cooperation has been consistently and critically low for multiple rounds).
            *   **AND** The number of remaining rounds (including the current round, `r - R + 1`) is greater than or equal to `reseed_rounds_remaining_minimum` (i.e., there's enough time left in the game for a re-seed to potentially pay off through subsequent free-riding).
            *   **AND** `contributed_in_previous_round` is `false` (i.e., this strategy did not contribute in the immediately preceding round, preventing it from becoming a repeated sucker if its last re-seed attempt failed to revive cooperation).

            *   **If ALL these re-seeding conditions are met:**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (1 token).
                *   **State Update:** Set `contributed_in_previous_round = true`.
                *   **Rationale:** This is a calculated, self-interested gamble. By temporarily "priming the pump" with a single contribution, the strategy hopes to signal to other players to revive their cooperation. If successful, this creates a larger pool of contributions from which this strategy can then free-ride for the remaining rounds, far outweighing the cost of its single contribution.

            *   **Else (If any of the re-seeding conditions are NOT met):**
                *   **Action:** Defect (0 tokens).
                *   **State Update:** Set `contributed_in_previous_round = false`.
                *   **Rationale:** Either cooperation is sufficient for continued free-riding, or it's too late/too risky to attempt a re-seed, so the strategy sticks to its primary exploitative default of defecting to secure its individual payoff of 1 token for the round.

---

**Exploitative Alignment & Robustness:**
This strategy is highly exploitative by defaulting to defection, ensuring it maximizes its personal gain when others contribute. It is robust against pure cooperators (always free-rides), and against pure defectors (always defects, ensuring it earns the baseline payoff of 1 per round). Its "re-seeding" mechanism makes it adaptive, allowing it to potentially revive a dying game to create new opportunities for free-riding, rather than letting the public good collapse entirely when it could still extract value. It avoids being a "sucker" by rarely contributing and only under strict, self-serving conditions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_11 = '''
This strategy, named "The Calculated Predator," aims to maximize individual payoff by strategically alternating between cooperative signals (baiting) and free-riding, only contributing when necessary to maintain an environment conducive to future exploitation or prevent a complete collapse of the public good. It is adaptive, robust, and explicitly exploitative.

**Strategy: The Calculated Predator**

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for total contributions.

**Internal Settings:**
*   `CalibrationRounds`: The number of initial rounds dedicated to probing and establishing a cooperative facade. Set to `min(3, r - 1)`. If `r=1`, this is effectively 0.
*   `EndGameHorizon`: The number of final rounds where the strategy switches to pure defection. Set to `max(1, min(3, r - CalibrationRounds))`. This ensures at least one end-game round, up to three, and prevents overlap with calibration if `r` is small.

**Decision Rules:**

**Phase 1: Initial Calibration and Deceptive Lure (Rounds 1 to `CalibrationRounds`)**

The goal of this phase is to establish an initial impression of cooperativeness (bait) and identify which opponents are likely to reciprocate cooperation.

*   **Round 1:**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).** Start with a cooperative action to signal potential goodwill and "bait" other players, especially those with Tit-for-Tat or conditionally cooperative strategies. This builds a foundation for later exploitation.

*   **Rounds 2 to `CalibrationRounds`:**
    *   Observe the actions of other players in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   Calculate `P_others_prev`: The proportion of *other players* (excluding myself) who contributed in round `t-1`.
        `P_others_prev = (sum_{j!=i} c_{j,t-1}) / (n-1)`
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `P_others_prev > 0.5`: **Contribute (C).** If a majority of other players responded positively to my initial bait, continue to contribute in this phase. This reinforces their belief in mutual cooperation, setting them up for more significant free-riding later.
        *   Else (`P_others_prev <= 0.5`): **Defect (D).** If other players are not sufficiently responsive to my cooperative signals, there's no strategic benefit to continuing to contribute in this phase. Switch to defection.

**Phase 2: Sustained Free-Riding and Collapse Prevention (Rounds `CalibrationRounds + 1` to `r - EndGameHorizon`)**

This is the primary exploitation phase. The strategy defaults to free-riding, but will temporarily contribute to "repair" the public good if cooperation levels drop too low, ensuring there's still a pool to exploit. This phase is skipped if `r` is too small (i.e., `CalibrationRounds + EndGameHorizon >= r`).

*   In each round `t` within this phase:
    *   Calculate `P_others_avg_window`: The average proportion of *other players* who contributed over the *last 3 rounds* (i.e., `t-1`, `t-2`, `t-3`). If fewer than 3 rounds of history exist in this phase, average over available rounds.
        `P_others_avg_window = (1 / (W * (n-1))) * sum_{x=t-W}^{t-1} sum_{j!=i} c_{j,x}` (where W is the actual number of history rounds).
    *   **Decision:**
        *   If `P_others_avg_window >= 0.4`: **Defect (D).** A sufficient number of other players are contributing, allowing me to free-ride and maximize my personal payoff. This threshold is chosen to be aggressive, prioritizing defection even if cooperation is only moderate.
        *   Else if `P_others_avg_window <= 0.1`: **Contribute (C).** Cooperation levels are critically low (near collapse). To prevent the public good from entirely disappearing and thus eliminating future free-riding opportunities, make a strategic, temporary contribution. This is a "system reset" move designed to encourage others to resume contributing, after which I will attempt to free-ride again.
        *   Else (i.e., `0.1 < P_others_avg_window < 0.4`): **Defect (D).** My default stance is to free-ride. Only specific conditions (high cooperation in calibration or near collapse in exploitation) warrant a contribution.

**Phase 3: End Game Exploitation (Last `EndGameHorizon` Rounds)**

In the final rounds, there are no future interactions to influence, so the strategy reverts to pure self-interest. This phase is always active for at least the very last round.

*   In each round `t` within this phase:
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** Maximize immediate payoff, as there are no long-term consequences for my actions.

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Initial Baiting:** The strategy begins with cooperation not out of genuine goodwill, but to "lure" other players into continued cooperation, which will then be exploited.
*   **Aggressive Free-Riding:** The default action is defection, even when a moderate level of cooperation exists (e.g., `P_others_avg_window >= 0.4`), demonstrating a clear intent to benefit from others' contributions without contributing myself.
*   **Strategic Contribution for Self-Gain:** Contributions are only made when it serves a direct, long-term self-interest: either to establish a deceptive cooperative facade or to "repair" a collapsing public good to ensure future opportunities for free-riding.
*   **Unconditional End-Game Defection:** All pretense of cooperation is dropped in the final rounds, prioritizing immediate maximum gain when future reputation is irrelevant.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_12 = '''
This strategy, named the "Opportunistic Defector," is designed to maximize individual payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. It is fundamentally exploitative, defaulting to defection, but includes a calculated, minimal re-seeding mechanism to prevent the complete collapse of the public good pool, from which even a free-rider benefits.

**Strategy: Opportunistic Defector**

The Opportunistic Defector adheres to the principle of maximizing its own current payoff while opportunistically attempting to maintain a viable pool of contributions from which to free-ride in the future, if the pool becomes too depleted.

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `k`: Multiplier for total contributions.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.

**Internal States:**
*   `last_reseeding_round`: Stores the round number when this strategy last contributed a "re-seeding" token. Initially 0.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Default Action: Defect (D)**
    *   In the absence of any other specific conditions, the Opportunistic Defector will always choose to **Defect (D)**, contributing 0 tokens. This maximizes the `(1 - c_i)` component of the payoff, which is the immediate individual benefit of 1 token.

2.  **First Round:**
    *   In **Round 1**: Always **Defect (D)**. This establishes an initial free-riding stance.

3.  **Last Rounds (End Game):**
    *   For the final `L` rounds, where `L = max(1, floor(r / 3))`: Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   Backward induction makes any attempt to induce future cooperation futile in these closing stages. The focus is purely on maximizing immediate gains.

4.  **Mid-Game (Adaptive Re-Seeding Logic):**
    *   This rule applies only in rounds `t` where `1 < t < r - L + 1`.
    *   **Observation:** After each round `t-1`, observe the contributions of all other players. Let `S_other_prev` be the sum of contributions from all players *other than myself* in the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   **Define Thresholds:**
        *   `Threshold_Low_Cooperation = max(1, floor((n - 1) / 3))`: If the number of other players contributing falls below this, cooperation is considered critically low.
        *   `Persistence_Rounds = 2`: The low cooperation level must persist for this many consecutive rounds to trigger a response.
        *   `Cool_Down_Rounds = max(1, floor(r / 10), 2)`: A minimum number of rounds must pass since the last re-seeding attempt to prevent excessive, costly contributions.
        *   `Min_Future_Rounds = Cool_Down_Rounds + 1`: There must be enough remaining rounds to potentially benefit from a re-seeded cooperation.
    *   **Trigger Conditions for Re-Seeding (Conditional Contribution):**
        The strategy will **Contribute (C)** for the current round (`t`) if *all* of the following conditions are met:
        *   **Condition 1 (Critically Low Cooperation):** The sum of contributions from other players in the previous round (`S_other_prev`) was less than `Threshold_Low_Cooperation`.
        *   **Condition 2 (Persistent Low Cooperation):** The sum of contributions from other players in round `t-2` was also less than `Threshold_Low_Cooperation`. (Requires history up to `t-2`).
        *   **Condition 3 (Re-Seeding Cooldown):** The current round `t` is greater than `last_reseeding_round + Cool_Down_Rounds`. (Ensures adherence to the cooldown period).
        *   **Condition 4 (Sufficient Future Horizon):** The number of remaining rounds (`r - t + 1`) is greater than `Min_Future_Rounds`. (Ensures there's enough time to benefit from renewed cooperation).
    *   **Action:**
        *   If all trigger conditions are met: **Contribute (C)** for this round (`t`). Update `last_reseeding_round = t`. This is a single, calculated, minimal investment designed to potentially "kickstart" conditional cooperators among opponents, with the expectation of returning to free-riding once cooperation is re-established.
        *   Otherwise (if any trigger condition is not met): Revert to the **Default Action: Defect (D)**.

---

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Free-Riding Default:** The strategy's primary mode is defection, directly exploiting any contributions made by others without reciprocating.
*   **Calculated Investment, Not Cooperation:** The "re-seeding" contribution is not an act of cooperation or altruism. It is a strictly self-interested, minimal investment made only when the overall public good is so diminished that the expected future payoff from free-riding becomes too low. The goal is to spend a small amount (1 token) to potentially induce a larger amount of future contributions from others, which the Opportunistic Defector will then exploit.
*   **No Reciprocity:** The strategy does not aim to build trust or sustained cooperation; it merely tries to "bait" or "nudge" other players into contributing again when their cooperation has significantly declined, only to revert to free-riding immediately afterward.
*   **End-Game Dominance:** The complete defection in the final rounds ensures that no potential future benefits are sacrificed for a contribution that cannot be recouped.

This strategy is adaptive because it reacts to the collective behavior of opponents, robust because it has clear rules for various scenarios, and clearly exploitative due to its inherent free-riding nature and self-serving "kickstarter" mechanism.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_13 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to maximize individual payoff by strategically leveraging the contributions of others. It aims to free-ride whenever possible, only contributing when necessary to prevent the collapse of the public good, thus preserving a pool for future exploitation.

**Strategy: The Adaptive Free-Rider**

**Parameters:**
*   `r_endgame_start`: The round number at which the endgame phase begins. This can be defined as `max(1, r - 3)`, meaning the last 3 rounds, or the last round if `r < 3`.
*   `history_window`: The number of recent rounds to consider for calculating average cooperation. A value of `3` to `5` is typically effective. For simplicity, we'll use `min(current_round - 1, 3)`.
*   `optimal_free_ride_threshold`: A threshold for the number of other players contributing, indicating a robust public good. Set at `(n - 1) * 0.5`. If more than half of other players contributed, it's a good time to free-ride.
*   `collapse_risk_threshold`: A low threshold for the average cooperation rate of others, indicating that the public good is at risk of collapsing. Set at `0.2` (meaning less than 20% of other players contributed on average).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution acts as a "bait" or a signal of potential cooperation. It tests the waters to see if other players are willing to contribute, establishing a baseline that can be exploited or managed in subsequent rounds.

2.  **Rounds `r_endgame_start` to `r` (Endgame Phase):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final rounds, the shadow of the future diminishes. Rational players will anticipate this and defect. This strategy capitalizes on the "endgame effect" by defecting to maximize immediate payoff, knowing that there are no future consequences to influence.

3.  **Rounds 2 to `r_endgame_start - 1` (Adaptive Exploitation Phase):**
    *   This is the core phase where the strategy dynamically decides whether to free-ride or strategically contribute based on observed behavior.

    a.  **Check for "Optimal Free-Riding" Opportunity:**
        *   Observe `N_cooperated_others_prev`: The number of *other players* (excluding self) who contributed in the immediately preceding round.
        *   **If `N_cooperated_others_prev >= optimal_free_ride_threshold`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* If a significant portion of other players are contributing, the public good is robust enough for this strategy to benefit substantially by free-riding (gaining an extra token by not contributing) without significantly damaging the overall pool.

    b.  **Check for "Public Good Collapse Risk":**
        *   Calculate `Avg_cooperation_others_recent`: The average contribution rate of *other players* over the last `history_window` rounds. This provides a smoothed indication of overall cooperation.
        *   **Else if `Avg_cooperation_others_recent < collapse_risk_threshold`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   *Rationale:* If cooperation among others is dangerously low, the public good is at risk of collapsing entirely. In this scenario, a strategic contribution is made to act as "bait," signaling a willingness to contribute, in an attempt to re-ignite or encourage contribution from other players. The goal is to revive the public good to a level where it can be exploited again in future rounds.

    c.  **Default Action (Intermediate Cooperation Levels):**
        *   **Else (neither of the above conditions is met):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* If cooperation is not high enough for immediate optimal free-riding, but also not so low as to risk a complete collapse, the strategy defaults to free-riding. This maintains an aggressive exploitative stance, implicitly pushing others to contribute more while the strategy benefits, and only intervening with its own contribution when absolutely necessary to prevent a breakdown.

**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**
This strategy is fundamentally exploitative. It starts by probing for cooperation, then primarily seeks to free-ride on others' contributions. It only contributes as a calculated investment to "bail out" a failing public good, aiming to prevent its total collapse so that it can continue to extract value from others' contributions in subsequent rounds. It abandons all pretense of cooperation in the endgame to secure maximum immediate gain.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_14 = '''
Here is an adaptive and robust exploitative strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others.

---

**Strategy Name: The Adaptive Free-Rider**

**Overall Principle:**
This strategy aims to extract maximum benefit from other players' contributions while minimizing its own cost. It primarily defects to free-ride, but incorporates a calculated "nudge" contribution only when cooperation has completely broken down and there are sufficient future rounds for this investment to potentially yield exploitable returns. It always prioritizes individual gain and avoids unrecoverable losses, particularly in the endgame.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1:**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** Begin by immediately adopting the single-round dominant strategy to secure an initial payoff without any personal cost. This establishes a self-interested baseline and allows observation of the group's initial propensity to cooperate or defect.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-2`):**
    *   Observe the total contributions from all *other* players in the *previous* round. Let this be `C_others_prev`.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `C_others_prev > 0` (at least one other player contributed):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).** (Contribute 0 tokens).
            *   **Rationale:** Other players are contributing, creating a public good. Maximize personal gain by free-riding on their contributions without making any personal sacrifice. This is the primary exploitative mode.
        *   **If `C_others_prev == 0` (all other players defected):**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).** (Contribute 1 token).
            *   **Rationale:** If cooperation has completely broken down (no one else contributed), make a single, calculated 'nudge' contribution. This is a strategic investment to test if a minimal personal effort can revive contributions from others, thereby creating new opportunities for free-riding in subsequent rounds. This "nudge" is only attempted when there are sufficient remaining rounds for potential exploitation (`r - current_round >= 2` to allow for the nudge and at least two subsequent rounds of potential free-riding).

3.  **Final Rounds (Round `r-1` and Round `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final two rounds, the logic of backward induction is paramount. There are no significant future rounds to influence, so any contribution is a guaranteed net loss (`1 - k/n`) that cannot be recouped. Defect to maximize immediate payoff, regardless of others' observed past actions. The 'nudge' mechanism is deactivated in these rounds as it is highly unlikely to yield sufficient future returns to justify the cost.

**Handling Edge Cases and Robustness:**

*   **Very Short Games (e.g., `r <= 3`):** The condition for the "nudge" (`current_round <= r-2`) automatically ensures that the strategy effectively defaults to "Always Defect" in games too short for a nudge to be meaningful. For example:
    *   If `r=1`: Only Round 1 occurs, so action is Defect.
    *   If `r=2`: Round 1 is Defect, Round 2 (which is `r`) is Defect.
    *   If `r=3`: Round 1 is Defect, Round 2 (which is `r-1`) is Defect, Round 3 (which is `r`) is Defect.
    This prevents wasteful contributions when there is no time for exploitation to occur.

*   **Wide Range of Opponent Behaviors:**
    *   **Against "Always Cooperate" (AC) strategies:** This strategy will consistently defect after Round 1, heavily exploiting AC players by taking their contributions without reciprocity.
    *   **Against "Always Defect" (AD) strategies:** This strategy will consistently defect (after Round 1), leading to the Nash Equilibrium where all players receive a payoff of 1 per round. It avoids any losses in this scenario.
    *   **Against "Tit-for-Tat" (TFT) or similar conditional cooperators:** This strategy will defect in Round 1. A TFT-like opponent, seeing this defection, will then defect in Round 2, leading to mutual defection from Round 2 onwards. This strategy avoids the initial cost that a "cooperate first" TFT might incur.
    *   **Against other "Conditional Cooperators" (e.g., those who stop contributing if others don't):** This strategy will free-ride as long as they contribute. If they cease contributing entirely, and the game is long enough, it makes one calculated "nudge" to see if it can re-establish an exploitable cooperative environment. If the nudge fails to revive contributions, it reverts to defection.

This strategy balances consistent exploitation with a pragmatic, adaptive mechanism to attempt to revive a completely dead public good, but only under conditions where it can realistically lead to future exploitable returns.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_15 = '''
The following strategy, "Prudent Exploiter," is designed to maximize individual payoff in the Public Goods Game by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. It incorporates adaptive elements to detect and exploit cooperation, while being robust against persistent defection by minimizing costly contributions.

---

**Strategy Name: Prudent Exploiter**

**Objective:** Maximize personal payoff by predominantly defecting, while strategically contributing only to establish or cautiously revive collective cooperation for future free-riding opportunities.

**State Variables:**

*   `has_observed_cooperation`: A boolean flag, initialized to `False`. This becomes `True` if, at any point in the game, more than one other player has contributed in a single round. This indicates that cooperation is a feasible outcome in this group.
*   `re_engagement_attempts_made`: An integer counter, initialized to `0`. This tracks how many times the strategy has made a "re-engagement" contribution (a contribution made when collective cooperation was very low) to prevent continuous, fruitless contributions.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   *Rationale*: Start with a contribution to signal potential cooperation and to gather initial data on the group's willingness to contribute. This is a minimal investment to explore future free-riding opportunities.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Dynamic Exploitation):**
    *   Let `current_round` be the current round number (`t`).
    *   Let `C_others_prev` be the number of *other* players (excluding myself) who contributed in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
    *   Let `My_Contribution_prev` be my own action in the immediately preceding round (`c_i(t-1)`).

    *   **Step 1: Update `has_observed_cooperation`:**
        *   If `C_others_prev > 1` (at least two other players cooperated), set `has_observed_cooperation = True`.
        *   *Rationale*: If multiple others cooperate, it signals a potential for a functional public good, making future re-engagement attempts more justified.

    *   **Step 2: Decide on current action based on conditions:**

        *   **Condition A: High Cooperation - Exploit:**
            *   If `C_others_prev >= ceil((n-1) / 2)` (i.e., a majority of other players contributed in the previous round).
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Rationale*: When a significant portion of the group is contributing, the public good is robust. This is the prime opportunity to maximize immediate personal payoff by free-riding without severely jeopardizing the public good's continuation.

        *   **Condition B: Low Cooperation - Limited Re-engagement (Cautious Revival):**
            *   Else if `C_others_prev <= 1` (very few or no other players contributed in the previous round).
                *   AND `My_Contribution_prev == 0` (I defected in the previous round, so I'm not repeatedly contributing).
                *   AND `has_observed_cooperation == True` (cooperation *has been observed* in this group before, suggesting it's not a futile endeavor).
                *   AND `re_engagement_attempts_made < 2` (limit total re-engagement contributions to a maximum of two, to prevent excessive losses).
                *   AND `current_round < r - 1` (not the very last non-final round, allowing time for a response).
                    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                    *   *Rationale*: If the public good is on the verge of collapse, but there's historical evidence of cooperation and I haven't exhausted my limited re-engagement budget, make a calculated, short-term investment to try and re-stimulate contributions from others. This is a strategic move to revive a potential source of future free-riding.
                    *   *Update State*: Increment `re_engagement_attempts_made`.

        *   **Condition C: Default Defection (Moderate or Failed Cooperation):**
            *   Else (in all other scenarios, including moderate levels of cooperation that are not strong enough to trigger Condition A, or if re-engagement conditions are not met).
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Rationale*: Default to defection. My contribution is a net loss in the current round, so I only make it under very specific strategic conditions where it is likely to lead to greater future gains through others' contributions.

3.  **Round `r` (Final Round Exploitation):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale*: In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. The dominant strategy is to defect, as there is no opportunity for future rewards or punishments. This maximizes the final round payoff.

---

This "Prudent Exploiter" strategy is adaptive because it responds to the level of group cooperation, robust against different opponent behaviors (it learns to free-ride on cooperators and cuts losses against defectors), and clearly exploitative by prioritizing defection and strategic, limited contribution.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_16 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Predator with Failsafe," is designed to maximize personal payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. It is highly exploitative, but includes a strategic "re-seeding" mechanism to prevent the complete collapse of the public good, thereby preserving future opportunities for exploitation. It also features a failsafe to avoid endless, fruitless cooperation against consistently non-cooperative opponents.

---

### **Strategy Parameters:**

*   **`COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`**: The minimum number of *other* players that must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to continue its default action of defecting. If fewer than this number contributed, the strategy will consider initiating a "re-seeding" phase.
    *   **Calculation:** `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD = max(1, floor((n-1) * 0.2))`
    *   *Rationale:* This sets a low bar, meaning even a small number of cooperators is enough for the strategy to continue free-riding, thus maximizing exploitation. A minimum of 1 ensures some contribution is necessary.
*   **`RESEED_DURATION_ROUNDS`**: The number of consecutive rounds this strategy will contribute if it initiates a "re-seeding" phase. This period is an investment to encourage others to resume or increase their contributions.
    *   **Calculation:** `RESEED_DURATION_ROUNDS = max(2, floor(r / 8))`
    *   *Rationale:* A duration of at least 2 rounds ensures a clear signal of temporary cooperation. Scaling with `r` allows for longer re-seeding in longer games, giving more time for opponents to react.
*   **`MAX_FAILED_RESEED_ATTEMPTS`**: The maximum number of times the strategy will attempt to "re-seed" cooperation without successfully raising the collective contribution above the `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`. If this limit is reached, the strategy will permanently switch to defection.
    *   **Value:** `3`
    *   *Rationale:* This prevents the strategy from continuously losing tokens by cooperating in an unresponsive environment (e.g., against "Always Defect" opponents).

### **Internal State Variables (Persistent across rounds):**

*   **`reseed_countdown`**: An integer, initialized to 0. When greater than 0, it indicates the number of rounds remaining in an active "re-seeding" phase.
*   **`failed_reseed_attempts`**: An integer, initialized to 0. This counter tracks how many times a "re-seeding" attempt has concluded without successfully raising the number of other cooperators above the `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`.
*   **`permanent_defection_mode`**: A boolean, initialized to `false`. Becomes `true` if `failed_reseed_attempts` reaches `MAX_FAILED_RESEED_ATTEMPTS`.
*   **`last_round_was_reseed_end`**: A boolean, initialized to `false`. Set to `true` at the end of a round if that round completed a "re-seeding" phase.

### **Decision Rules (for each round `t` from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Handle End of Game (Last Round):**
    *   **If `t == r`:**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions or opportunities for exploitation, so the dominant strategy of defection maximizes immediate payoff without repercussions.
        *   Reset `last_round_was_reseed_end = false`.

2.  **Check for Permanent Defection (Failsafe Triggered):**
    *   **If `permanent_defection_mode` is `true`:**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   *Rationale:* The strategy has determined that further attempts to re-seed cooperation are futile against persistently non-cooperative opponents. It defaults to maximizing payoff by always defecting, avoiding further losses from fruitless cooperation.
        *   Reset `last_round_was_reseed_end = false`.

3.  **Process Completed Reseed Attempts (Pre-Decision Check):**
    *   **If `last_round_was_reseed_end` is `true` (meaning a re-seeding phase just ended in round `t-1`):**
        *   Observe `C_others_prev_round`, the number of other players who contributed in round `t-1`.
        *   **If `C_others_prev_round < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   Increment `failed_reseed_attempts` by 1.
            *   *Rationale:* The re-seeding effort did not result in sufficient cooperation, marking it as a failed attempt.
        *   Set `last_round_was_reseed_end = false`.

4.  **Execute Re-seeding Phase (If Active):**
    *   **If `reseed_countdown > 0`:**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   Decrement `reseed_countdown` by 1.
        *   **If `reseed_countdown == 0` (this contribution completed the current re-seeding phase):**
            *   Set `last_round_was_reseed_end = true`.
        *   *Rationale:* The strategy is currently in an active "re-seeding" phase, fulfilling its commitment to encourage others' cooperation.

5.  **Main Decision Logic (Default Exploitation or New Reseed Trigger):**
    *   **Else (`reseed_countdown == 0` and `permanent_defection_mode == false`):**
        *   **First Round (`t == 1`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   *Rationale:* Start by exploiting to gauge initial opponent behavior and secure immediate gain. There is no prior history (`C_others_prev_round`) to evaluate. All internal state variables (`reseed_countdown`, `failed_reseed_attempts`, `permanent_defection_mode`, `last_round_was_reseed_end`) are assumed to be at their initialized values.
        *   **Subsequent Intermediate Rounds (`t > 1`):**
            *   **Check for Failsafe Trigger (again, in case it just became true from the "Pre-Decision Check"):**
                *   **If `failed_reseed_attempts >= MAX_FAILED_RESEED_ATTEMPTS`:**
                    *   Set `permanent_defection_mode = true`.
                    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                    *   *Rationale:* The failsafe has been triggered. The strategy now permanently defects, preventing further assessment.
                *   **Else (not in permanent defection yet):**
                    *   Observe `C_others_prev_round`, the number of other players who contributed in round `t-1`.
                    *   **If `C_others_prev_round >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:**
                        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                        *   Reset `failed_reseed_attempts = 0`.
                        *   *Rationale:* Sufficient cooperation from others is observed, allowing for free-riding. Any previous failed re-seed attempts are cleared as the environment is now sufficiently cooperative.
                    *   **Else (`C_others_prev_round < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):**
                        *   Set `reseed_countdown = RESEED_DURATION_ROUNDS - 1`. (This round, the strategy will contribute, and `reseed_countdown` tracks the remaining rounds).
                        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                        *   *Rationale:* Cooperation levels are too low to sustain free-riding. The strategy invests in a new "re-seeding" phase to try and revive collective contributions.

Overview:
The "Adaptive Opportunist" strategy is designed to maximize its own payoff in the Public Goods Game by primarily free-riding on others' contributions. It employs a nuanced approach that balances initial efforts to stimulate cooperation with aggressive exploitation and robust self-protection mechanisms to avoid being consistently exploited itself. The strategy prioritizes defection as its default action, only contributing when a calculated benefit (such as initiating or re-establishing a pool for future exploitation) is perceived, or during an initial "seeding" phase.

Game Parameters:
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n).

Internal Strategy Parameters:
*   `ENDGAME_ROUNDS = 2`: The number of final rounds during which the strategy will always defect, irrespective of past history or current cooperation levels. This accounts for the standard backward induction logic in finite repeated games.
*   `INITIAL_SEED_ROUNDS = max(1, min(3, floor(r / 10)))`: The number of initial rounds (e.g., Round 1 to `INITIAL_SEED_ROUNDS`) during which the strategy will contribute. This phase aims to "seed" cooperation, testing opponents' willingness to contribute and potentially establishing a baseline of collective contributions that can be exploited later.
*   `REPRIMING_WINDOW = 5`: The number of most recent rounds to consider when calculating the average contribution rate of other players. This window provides a dynamic assessment of current group cooperation.
*   `REPRIMING_THRESHOLD = 0.3`: A critical threshold for collective cooperation. If the average contribution rate from *other players* over the `REPRIMING_WINDOW` falls *below* this value, the strategy will consider contributing to "re-prime the pump." This is a calculated risk to stimulate renewed cooperation, hoping to create a larger pool for future exploitation. (A lower threshold means the strategy is more tolerant of defection before attempting to re-prime).
*   `SOLO_CONTRIBUTION_SHUTDOWN_STREAK = 2`: If the strategy contributes (C) for this many consecutive rounds and observes that *only it* contributed (i.e., total contributions for that round were 1), it triggers a permanent defection mode. This prevents the strategy from being a persistent "sucker."

State Variables (reset at the start of each tournament game):
*   `solo_contribution_count = 0`: A counter that tracks consecutive rounds where this strategy contributed but no other player did.
*   `permanent_defection_mode = false`: A boolean flag that, when true, forces the strategy to defect for all remaining rounds, overriding other decision rules.

Decision Rules (for the current_round):

1.  **Permanent Defection Check:**
    *   If `permanent_defection_mode` is true:
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
        *   *Post-action:* Reset `solo_contribution_count = 0`. (Any prior contribution attempts are now abandoned).

2.  **Endgame Logic:**
    *   If `current_round > r - ENDGAME_ROUNDS`:
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
        *   *Post-action:* Reset `solo_contribution_count = 0`. (There are no future rounds to influence).

3.  **Initial Seeding Phase:**
    *   If `current_round <= INITIAL_SEED_ROUNDS`:
        *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
        *   *Post-action (after observing round outcomes):*
            *   Let `total_contributions_this_round` be the observed sum of all players' contributions for the current round.
            *   If `total_contributions_this_round == 1` (implying *only this strategy* contributed, since it contributed 1):
                *   Increment `solo_contribution_count`.
            *   Else (if others contributed too, or this strategy didn't contribute, which is not the case here):
                *   Reset `solo_contribution_count = 0`.
            *   If `solo_contribution_count >= SOLO_CONTRIBUTION_SHUTDOWN_STREAK`:
                *   Set `permanent_defection_mode = true`. (The initial seeding failed, so abandon further cooperation attempts).

4.  **Adaptive Exploitation and Re-priming Phase:**
    *   This phase applies to rounds after `INITIAL_SEED_ROUNDS` and before the `ENDGAME_ROUNDS`.
    *   **Calculate `past_others_avg_coop_rate`:**
        *   Determine `num_rounds_to_consider = min(current_round - 1, REPRIMING_WINDOW)`. This considers history up to the maximum `REPRIMING_WINDOW` rounds, or fewer if not enough rounds have passed.
        *   Calculate `past_others_total_contributions = sum of (contributions by players j != i in the last num_rounds_to_consider rounds)`.
        *   `past_others_avg_coop_rate = past_others_total_contributions / ((n - 1) * num_rounds_to_consider)`. (Assume `n >= 2`, so `n-1 >= 1`). If `num_rounds_to_consider` is 0, treat `past_others_avg_coop_rate` as 0.

    *   **Decision based on `past_others_avg_coop_rate`:**
        *   **If `past_others_avg_coop_rate >= REPRIMING_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**. (Exploitative free-riding: others are contributing enough for this strategy to benefit by defecting).
            *   *Post-action:* Reset `solo_contribution_count = 0`.
        *   **Else (`past_others_avg_coop_rate < REPRIMING_THRESHOLD`):**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**. (Attempt to "re-prime the pump" and encourage renewed cooperation, hoping to re-establish a larger pool to exploit in subsequent rounds).
            *   *Post-action (after observing round outcomes):*
                *   Let `total_contributions_this_round` be the observed sum of all players' contributions for the current round.
                *   If `total_contributions_this_round == 1` (meaning *only this strategy* contributed):
                    *   Increment `solo_contribution_count`.
                *   Else:
                    *   Reset `solo_contribution_count = 0`.
                *   If `solo_contribution_count >= SOLO_CONTRIBUTION_SHUTDOWN_STREAK`:
                    *   Set `permanent_defection_mode = true`. (The re-priming attempt failed repeatedly, so abandon further cooperation attempts).

This strategy aggressively seeks to exploit cooperative behavior while being defensively robust against being a "sucker," demonstrating a pragmatic and self-interested approach consistent with an exploitative mindset.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_18 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Free-Rider with Calculated Reciprocity Bait," is designed to maximize its own payoff in the Public Goods Game by primarily free-riding on others' contributions. It adaptively and robustly adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of other players, with any contributions being strictly a strategic investment to prolong or enhance future opportunities for exploitation.

**Internal State (maintained across rounds):**

*   `my_last_action`: Records whether the strategy contributed (C) or defected (D) in the previous round. Initialized to `D`.
*   `consecutive_defect_rounds`: An integer counter for the number of consecutive rounds this strategy has defected. Resets to 0 after a contribution. Initialized to 0.

**Decision Rules for Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Reasoning:* Begin by free-riding to establish an exploitative baseline and test the initial cooperativeness of other players.
    *   *State Update:* Set `my_last_action = D`, `consecutive_defect_rounds = 1`.

2.  **Endgame Rounds:**
    *   Define `endgame_window = max(1, min(3, ceil(r / 5.0)))`. This sets the final few rounds (1 to 3, depending on `r`) where strategic future-gazing is irrelevant.
    *   If `t > r - endgame_window`:
        *   **Action: Defect (D).**
        *   *Reasoning:* The game is concluding; there are no future rounds to influence or exploit. Maximize immediate payoff by free-riding.
        *   *State Update:* Set `my_last_action = D`, `consecutive_defect_rounds = 1`.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t <= r - endgame_window`):**

    *   **Observation:** At the start of round `t`, observe the actions of all players from the previous round `(t-1)`. Calculate `num_others_contributed_prev`, which is the total number of other players (excluding self) who contributed in round `(t-1)`.

    *   **Dynamic Thresholds:**
        *   `high_cooperation_threshold = ceil((n - 1) * 0.6)`: If `num_others_contributed_prev` meets or exceeds this, it signifies a strong level of cooperation among others.
        *   `low_cooperation_threshold = ceil((n - 1) * 0.2)`: If `num_others_contributed_prev` falls below this, cooperation is considered too minimal to be worth investing in.
        *   `bait_trigger_threshold = max(3, ceil(n / k))`: This parameter determines how many consecutive rounds of defection must occur before considering a "bait" contribution. It's inversely related to `k`: if `k` is high (public good is very efficient), the threshold is lower, meaning we bait sooner to keep the valuable public good alive. If `k` is low (less efficient), the threshold is higher, meaning we wait longer as the public good is less worth the investment.

    *   **Decision Logic:**

        *   **A. High Cooperation Observed - Exploit Vigorously:**
            *   If `num_others_contributed_prev >= high_cooperation_threshold`:
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Reasoning:* Others are generously maintaining the public good at a high level. Exploit their contributions to maximize personal gain without contributing.
                *   *State Update:* Increment `consecutive_defect_rounds`. Set `my_last_action = D`.

        *   **B. Moderate Cooperation - Consider Strategic Baiting:**
            *   If `num_others_contributed_prev >= low_cooperation_threshold` AND `num_others_contributed_prev < high_cooperation_threshold`:
                *   *Reasoning:* Cooperation is present but not robust, and may be at risk of decline. This is the prime opportunity for a calculated intervention.
                *   **Sub-condition: Time to "Bait" (Strategic Contribution)?**
                    *   If `consecutive_defect_rounds >= bait_trigger_threshold`:
                        *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                        *   *Reasoning:* This is a strategic "bait" or "re-engagement" contribution. The purpose is to temporarily invest a token to encourage other players to increase or sustain their contributions, thus making the public good more valuable for future, long-term exploitation.
                        *   *State Update:* Reset `consecutive_defect_rounds = 0`. Set `my_last_action = C`.
                    *   Else (Not yet time to bait, or recently baited):
                        *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                        *   *Reasoning:* Continue free-riding for now. The conditions for a strategic bait are not yet met (e.g., haven't defected long enough to signal disengagement, or just recently baited).
                        *   *State Update:* Increment `consecutive_defect_rounds`. Set `my_last_action = D`.

        *   **C. Very Low / Dying Cooperation - Defect and Abandon:**
            *   If `num_others_contributed_prev < low_cooperation_threshold`:
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Reasoning:* The public good is too small, or too few players are contributing to justify an investment. A single contribution from this strategy is unlikely to significantly revive the public good and would be a wasted token. Maximize immediate individual payoff by taking the sure value of 1.
                *   *State Update:* Increment `consecutive_defect_rounds`. Set `my_last_action = D`.

This strategy prioritizes individual gain, using conditional contributions only as a calculated, self-interested investment to prolong or enhance future opportunities for free-riding. It is designed to be robust against a wide range of opponent strategies by adapting to observed cooperation levels and strategically intervening only when it can yield a net benefit to the exploiter.

**Strategy Name: Opportunistic Pumper**

This strategy aims to maximize personal payoff by primarily free-riding, but strategically contributing when cooperation levels among opponents are critically low, to "pump" the system and encourage renewed contributions, after which it reverts to free-riding. It is designed to be exploitative by defaulting to defection, only contributing when necessary to sustain the public good for future exploitation, and always defecting when the future is irrelevant.

**Internal Parameters:**

*   `Low_Cooperation_Threshold_Ratio = 0.4` (A fixed ratio. If the average contribution from other players falls below this, it signals dangerously low cooperation.)
*   `Min_Effective_Contributors = max(1, floor((n - 1) / 4))` (The minimum number of other players who contributed in the previous round that makes it worthwhile to attempt to "pump" the system. If fewer contributed, the cause is likely lost, and a contribution would be wasted.)

**Decision Rules:**

**1. Initial Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
        *   Rationale: Maximize immediate gain and observe the initial cooperativeness of opponents without personal cost.

**2. Endgame Rounds (`current_round >= r - 1`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
        *   Rationale: In the final rounds, there is no future to influence. Backward induction implies that defecting is the optimal strategy, as any contribution would be a pure loss.

**3. Mid-Game Rounds (`1 < current_round < r - 1`):**

    *   **Observe Past Actions (from previous round, `t-1`):**
        *   `N_others_c_prev`: The total number of *other players* (excluding me) who contributed (C) in round `t-1`.
        *   `My_Action_prev`: My own action in round `t-1` (C or D).

    *   **Calculate Average Other Contribution:**
        *   `avg_others_contribution_prev_round = N_others_c_prev / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Decision Logic:**

        *   **Default Action: Defect (D).**
            *   Unless explicitly stated otherwise by the conditions below, the strategy will always defect (D) to free-ride.

        *   **Condition to Contribute (C):**
            I will contribute (C) *only if* all of the following conditions are met:

            1.  **Low Cooperation Warning:** `avg_others_contribution_prev_round < Low_Cooperation_Threshold_Ratio`.
                *   Rationale: The public good is in danger of collapsing due to insufficient contributions from others. This is the trigger for intervention.

            2.  **Sufficient Potential for Response:** `N_others_c_prev >= Min_Effective_Contributors`.
                *   Rationale: There are still enough players actively contributing (or just stopped) for my "pump" action to potentially make a difference. If cooperation is already too low (e.g., zero or one other contributor), my single contribution is unlikely to turn the tide and would be wasted.

            3.  **My Recent Action was Defection:** `My_Action_prev == D`.
                *   Rationale: This ensures I attempt to 'pump' the system *after* a period of free-riding. If I contributed (C) in the previous round and cooperation didn't significantly improve (triggering Condition 1 again), it suggests my pump failed or others are unresponsive, and I should revert to free-riding instead of continuing to be a "sucker."

### Strategy Name: The Opportunistic Exploiter

This strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by strategically leveraging the cooperation of other players. It achieves this through an initial period of probing, adaptive free-riding, calculated re-engagement to sustain a cooperative environment, and a definitive end-game defection. The strategy is robust across various opponent types by dynamically adjusting to observed cooperation levels.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: total number of players
*   `r`: total number of rounds
*   `k`: multiplier

**Strategy-Specific Parameters:**

*   **`probe_rounds`**: The number of initial rounds the strategy will contribute to "test the waters."
    *   Calculated as: `max(1, min(floor(r / 4), 3))`
    *   *Rationale:* For instance, 3 rounds for a long game, or 1 round for a very short game. This parameter sets an initial investment to gauge the cooperativeness of others.
*   **`end_game_rounds`**: The number of final rounds where the strategy will always defect.
    *   Calculated as: `max(1, min(floor(r / 5), 3))`
    *   *Rationale:* For instance, 3 rounds for a long game, or 1 round for a very short game. This parameter accounts for the backward induction effect in finitely repeated games.
*   **`history_window_size`**: The number of immediate past rounds used to calculate the average contribution of other players.
    *   Calculated as: `min(current_round - 1, 5)`
    *   *Rationale:* This ensures a window of up to 5 rounds, but will only use available history in the very early stages of the game.
*   **`cooperation_threshold_high`**: If the average contribution rate of other players is at or above this value, the strategy will free-ride (defect).
    *   Value: `0.6` (i.e., if 60% or more of other players contributed on average in recent history).
*   **`cooperation_threshold_low`**: If the average contribution rate of other players is at or below this value, the strategy will cease efforts to encourage cooperation and defect.
    *   Value: `0.2` (i.e., if 20% or less of other players contributed on average in recent history).

**Decision Rules:**

The strategy operates in three distinct phases:

**1. Initial Probe Phase (Current Round <= `probe_rounds`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This initial cooperative gesture serves as an investment. It probes for cooperative behavior from other players and aims to establish a baseline of collective contributions. This phase helps differentiate between consistently defecting opponents and those willing to cooperate, creating an environment ripe for future exploitation.

**2. Middle Game Phase (`probe_rounds` < Current Round <= `r` - `end_game_rounds`):**
    *   **Observation:** At the start of each round in this phase, the strategy calculates the `avg_other_contribution_rate`. This is the average contribution rate of all *other* players over the last `history_window_size` rounds.
        *   `avg_other_contribution_rate = (Sum of contributions by all other players in `history_window_size` past rounds) / ((n - 1) * history_window_size)`
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `avg_other_contribution_rate` >= `cooperation_threshold_high` (e.g., 0.6):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** When other players are cooperating at a high and sustainable level, this strategy capitalizes by free-riding. It exploits the established collective good to maximize its individual payoff without contributing.
        *   **Else if `avg_other_contribution_rate` <= `cooperation_threshold_low` (e.g., 0.2):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** If cooperation among others has significantly collapsed or is too low, attempting to contribute would be a losing proposition. This strategy cuts its losses by defecting to avoid being a "sucker" in a non-cooperative environment.
        *   **Else (`cooperation_threshold_low` < `avg_other_contribution_rate` < `cooperation_threshold_high`):**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** Cooperation is currently at a precarious level. This is a strategic re-engagement. The strategy contributes to try and re-stimulate cooperation among others, aiming to nudge the `avg_other_contribution_rate` back into the higher range where free-riding becomes profitable again. This contribution is not altruistic but an investment in future exploitation.

**3. End Game Phase (Current Round > `r` - `end_game_rounds`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds of the game, there is no opportunity for future interactions to influence. Backward induction dictates that the optimal strategy is to defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no consequences for future rounds. This is a purely self-interested move characteristic of an exploitative strategy.

**Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:**

The "Opportunistic Exploiter" is designed to exploit other players by:
*   **Probing for weakness:** It uses initial cooperation to identify and encourage cooperative opponents, creating an environment beneficial for later exploitation.
*   **Aggressive free-riding:** It defects as soon as other players demonstrate sufficient and sustained cooperation, maximizing its individual gain from the public good without contributing its share.
*   **Calculated manipulation:** It only contributes when it believes such an action can strategically revive cooperation for future free-riding opportunities, not out of genuine reciprocity or altruism.
*   **Risk aversion to being exploited:** It defects to cut losses and avoid being a "sucker" when cooperation from others is too low to be beneficial.
*   **Terminal defection:** It leverages the known end of the game to maximize final gains without concern for future outcomes, consistent with the principle of backward induction.

### Strategy: Calculated Opportunist

**Parameters (Tuned for general robustness):**
*   `T_reset_cooperation`: 0.25 (If the average contribution of other players drops below this threshold, the strategy considers a catalytic contribution.)
*   `FREE_RIDE_DURATION`: 5 (Number of rounds to commit to defecting after making a catalytic contribution, maximizing free-riding on the potential "reset.")
*   `END_GAME_WINDOW_SIZE`: `max(1, min(5, r // 3))` (Number of final rounds where the strategy will unconditionally defect. `r // 3` ensures it's proportional to total rounds, clamped between 1 and 5 rounds.)

**Internal State (initialized at the start of the game):**
*   `free_ride_rounds_left`: Integer, initialized to 0. This counter tracks how many rounds are left in a forced free-riding period following a catalytic contribution.

**Decision Rules (for current round `t`, from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **First Round (`t == 1`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   *Rationale:* This is the dominant strategy in a single-shot game. It allows the player to observe opponent behavior without incurring an immediate cost and sets an initial exploitative stance.

2.  **End Game (`t > r - END_GAME_WINDOW_SIZE`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   *Rationale:* As the game approaches its end, the "shadow of the future" diminishes. There are no sufficient future interactions to incentivize cooperation, so the optimal exploitative strategy is to defect unconditionally to maximize immediate payoff.

3.  **During Forced Free-Ride Period (`free_ride_rounds_left > 0`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   Decrement `free_ride_rounds_left` by 1.
    *   *Rationale:* After making a catalytic contribution (see Rule 4a), the strategy commits to a period of free-riding to recoup the investment and fully exploit the potentially revitalized public good.

4.  **Adaptive Phase (All other rounds not covered above):**
    *   Calculate the average contribution rate of **all other players** in the *previous round*:
        `avg_c_others_prev_round = (sum of c_j for all j != player i in previous round) / (n - 1)`.

    *   **a. If `avg_c_others_prev_round < T_reset_cooperation`:**
        *   **Action: Contribute (C)** (Contribute 1 token).
        *   Set `free_ride_rounds_left = FREE_RIDE_DURATION`.
        *   *Rationale:* When collective contributions are too low, the player's share of the public good becomes negligible. This catalytic contribution is a calculated investment to try and re-stimulate others' cooperation. The goal is not to be a "good" cooperator, but to "reset" the game state to one where there are more contributions to free-ride on later. The `free_ride_rounds_left` state variable ensures immediate subsequent exploitation.

    *   **b. Else (`avg_c_others_prev_round >= T_reset_cooperation`):**
        *   **Action: Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
        *   *Rationale:* If others are contributing sufficiently, the most exploitative action is to free-ride on their efforts, maximizing the player's personal payoff without incurring the cost of contribution.

---

**Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:**
*   **Default Defection:** The strategy prioritizes defecting unless there's a strong strategic reason to do otherwise, directly leveraging the personal incentive to keep the token (`1 - c_i`).
*   **Calculated Contribution:** Contributions are treated as investments, made only when the public good is too depleted to be worth free-riding on, and immediately followed by a committed period of free-riding (`FREE_RIDE_DURATION`). This ensures any contribution serves a selfish, long-term payoff maximization goal rather than collective welfare.
*   **End-Game Ruthlessness:** Unconditional defection in the final rounds eliminates any pretense of cooperation when future benefits are non-existent.

**Adaptiveness and Robustness:**
*   **Adaptive:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of other players (specifically, their average contribution rate).
*   **Robust:**
    *   Against persistent defectors, it will quickly revert to full defection, ensuring a baseline payoff of 1 (from keeping its own token).
    *   Against persistent cooperators, it will primarily defect, maximizing its free-riding gains.
    *   Against conditional cooperators (e.g., Tit-for-Tat variants), it can trigger cooperation with a catalytic contribution and then exploit it, creating a cycle of exploitation and re-stimulation.
    *   The use of `T_reset_cooperation` and `FREE_RIDE_DURATION` parameters allows it to withstand temporary fluctuations in opponent behavior and commit to an exploitative stance.
    *   The `END_GAME_WINDOW_SIZE` makes it robust to the finite nature of the game, preventing costly "investments" too close to the end.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_22 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Exploiter," is designed to maximize individual payoff by strategically leveraging the cooperation of other players. It aims to induce cooperation when beneficial, exploit it when present, and defend against being exploited when cooperation is low.

**Internal Parameters (Recommended Values):**

*   **`threshold_high_cooperation`**: A proportion (e.g., 0.6 or 60%) of other players contributing. If the observed cooperation from others meets or exceeds this, the strategy will primarily seek to exploit.
*   **`threshold_low_cooperation`**: A proportion (e.g., 0.2 or 20%) of other players contributing. If cooperation falls below this, the strategy will prioritize self-preservation and defect.
*   **`max_re_inducement_streak`**: The maximum number of consecutive rounds this strategy will contribute to try and re-induce cooperation when it's at a moderate level. (Recommended: 2 rounds).

*   **`current_re_inducement_streak`**: A counter tracking consecutive rounds this strategy has contributed specifically as an attempt to re-induce cooperation (reset to 0 when defection occurs or cooperation is high).

---

**Decision Rules for Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Probe - Establish Potential for Exploitation):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy begins by signaling a willingness to cooperate. This initial contribution is a strategic investment designed to encourage other players to also contribute, thereby creating a common pool that can be exploited in subsequent rounds.
    *   *Update State:* Set `my_last_action = C`.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-2` (Adaptive Exploitation Phase):**
    *   *Preparation:* Observe all players' actions in round `t-1`. Calculate `C_others_t_minus_1` (the number of contributions from *other* players in round `t-1`) and `P_others_cooperated_t_minus_1 = C_others_t_minus_1 / (n-1)` (the proportion of other players who contributed).

    *   **Scenario A: High Cooperation Detected (Exploit Directly):**
        *   **If `P_others_cooperated_t_minus_1 >= threshold_high_cooperation`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   **Rationale:** Others are contributing sufficiently. This is the prime opportunity to exploit their contributions by defecting, thus securing the personal 1 token while still benefiting from the shared common pool created by their efforts.
            *   *Update State:* Set `my_last_action = D`, reset `current_re_inducement_streak = 0`.

    *   **Scenario B: Low Cooperation Detected (Self-Preservation):**
        *   **Else if `P_others_cooperated_t_minus_1 <= threshold_low_cooperation`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   **Rationale:** Cooperation among others is too low to be profitable, even with my contribution. Continuing to contribute would be highly disadvantageous. Prioritize self-preservation by keeping the private endowment.
            *   *Update State:* Set `my_last_action = D`, reset `current_re_inducement_streak = 0`.

    *   **Scenario C: Moderate Cooperation (Strategic Re-Inducement):**
        *   **Else (`threshold_low_cooperation < P_others_cooperated_t_minus_1 < threshold_high_cooperation`):**
            *   **If `current_re_inducement_streak < max_re_inducement_streak`:**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                *   **Rationale:** Cooperation is neither high enough to directly exploit nor low enough to abandon. This strategy makes a strategic investment by contributing to try and re-induce or sustain cooperation, hoping to foster conditions for future exploitation.
                *   *Update State:* Set `my_last_action = C`, increment `current_re_inducement_streak`.
            *   **Else (`current_re_inducement_streak >= max_re_inducement_streak`):**
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   **Rationale:** The strategy has tried to re-induce cooperation for the maximum allowed consecutive rounds (`max_re_inducement_streak`) without sufficient positive response from others. It's time to stop investing and signal that further non-reciprocation will be met with defection.
                *   *Update State:* Set `my_last_action = D`, reset `current_re_inducement_streak = 0`.

3.  **Rounds `r-1` and `r` (End-Game Phase - Certain Defection):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds of a repeated game, the incentive to influence future play disappears because there are no future rounds. Consequently, the dominant strategy for a single round (defecting) applies. It is irrational to contribute when there are no future gains to be made from fostering cooperation.
    *   *Update State:* Set `my_last_action = D`, reset `current_re_inducement_streak = 0`. (The state won't matter after round `r`, but it's good practice).

---

**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**

This strategy embodies an exploitative mindset by:
*   **Prioritizing Defection:** Its default action in good conditions (high cooperation) is to defect, maximizing individual gain at the expense of collective benefit.
*   **Strategic Investment:** It strategically contributes in Round 1 and during moderate cooperation to create or maintain a pool of contributions that can later be exploited. These contributions are not for altruism but for calculated self-interest.
*   **No Sucker Play:** It avoids contributing when cooperation is too low or when its attempts to re-induce cooperation are not reciprocated, ensuring it doesn't lose tokens unnecessarily.
*   **End-Game Rationality:** It exploits the finite nature of the game by defecting in the final rounds when there's no longer any strategic benefit to cooperation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_23 = '''
This strategy, named "The Calculated Parasite," aims to maximize its own payoff by free-riding on others' contributions as much as possible, only intervening with its own contributions when there is a risk of collective contributions collapsing to a point where exploitation becomes unprofitable. It is designed to be adaptive and robust across various opponent behaviors.

**Strategy: The Calculated Parasite**

**Game Parameters & Internal States:**
*   `n`: Number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `AvgC_others_prev`: The average contribution rate of all *other players* in the immediately preceding round. (Calculated as `(sum_j_ne_i c_j_prev) / (n-1)`).
*   `T_critical`: A threshold (e.g., 0.25). If the average contribution of others falls below this, the strategy considers cooperation to be in jeopardy and intervenes. This value represents the minimum level of collective contribution required for the game to remain worth exploiting.
*   `T_high_cooperation`: A threshold (e.g., 0.75). If the average contribution of others is at or above this, the strategy considers cooperation robust enough for aggressive free-riding.
*   `Intervention_Rounds`: The number of consecutive rounds the strategy will contribute after hitting `T_critical`. (e.g., 1 or 2 rounds).
*   `Endgame_Horizon`: The number of final rounds in the game where the strategy will always defect. (e.g., `max(1, floor(r * 0.1))`).
*   `intervention_active`: A boolean flag, `True` if the strategy is currently in a phase of contributing to re-incentivize others.
*   `intervention_countdown`: An integer counter, representing rounds remaining in the `intervention_active` phase.

**Initial Setup (Before Round 1):**
*   Set `intervention_active = False`.
*   Set `intervention_countdown = 0`.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Investment):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution serves as an investment. It signals a willingness to cooperate, which can encourage other players to contribute, thereby establishing a baseline of collective good that can later be exploited.

2.  **Endgame Phase (Current round `t` is from `r - Endgame_Horizon + 1` to `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final rounds, there are no future interactions to incentivize. The dominant strategy for a single-shot game applies, maximizing immediate payoff without concern for future consequences.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (All other rounds `t`, from 2 up to `r - Endgame_Horizon`):**

    *   **First, check if an intervention is currently active:**
        *   If `intervention_active` is `True`:
            *   If `intervention_countdown > 0`:
                *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                *   Decrement `intervention_countdown`.
                *   Return this action for the current round.
            *   Else (`intervention_countdown == 0`):
                *   Set `intervention_active = False`. (The intervention period has ended, proceed to main decision logic).

    *   **Main Decision Logic (if no intervention is active):**
        *   **A. Cooperation Collapse Imminent (Trigger Intervention):**
            *   If `AvgC_others_prev < T_critical`:
                *   Set `intervention_active = True`.
                *   Set `intervention_countdown = Intervention_Rounds - 1`. (The current round's contribution counts as the first intervention round).
                *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                *   *Rationale:* When the average contribution from others drops below `T_critical`, the total public good becomes too small to profitably free-ride on. This strategic contribution aims to "re-seed" cooperation and prevent a complete collapse, thereby preserving a minimal level of collective contributions for future exploitation.
        *   **B. High Cooperation (Exploit Aggressively):**
            *   Else if `AvgC_others_prev >= T_high_cooperation`:
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Rationale:* If a large proportion of other players are contributing, the strategy can safely free-ride without significantly risking the collapse of cooperation. This directly maximizes immediate individual gain.
        *   **C. Moderate Cooperation (Default to Defection, but be ready to intervene):**
            *   Else (`T_critical <= AvgC_others_prev < T_high_cooperation`):
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Rationale:* In this intermediate state, the strategy defaults to its exploitative core. It continues to free-ride, pushing the boundaries of others' tolerance, knowing that the `T_critical` threshold will trigger an intervention if cooperation falls too low.

**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**
This strategy is fundamentally exploitative because its default action is to defect, maximizing its individual gain by contributing nothing while benefiting from others' contributions. It only contributes as a calculated, self-serving move to prevent the complete erosion of the public good that it depends on for its own profits. It seeks to *induce* and *maintain* cooperation in others at the lowest possible personal cost, always defaulting to free-riding when circumstances permit.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_24 = '''
This strategy, named "The Calculated Free-Rider," is designed to be highly exploitative, adaptive, and robust. It aims to maximize its own payoff by generally free-riding on the contributions of others, only contributing strategically to initiate cooperation, prevent its complete collapse, or react to specific circumstances, while protecting itself from being continually exploited.

---

### Strategy Name: The Calculated Free-Rider

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Internal Strategy Parameters:**
*   `LURE_ROUNDS`: Number of initial rounds to unconditionally contribute. Set to `max(0, min(2, r-1))`. This ensures a short lure, and avoids luring in single-round games (`r=1`).
*   `ASSESSMENT_WINDOW`: Number of most recent rounds (from the exploitation phase) used to calculate `average_other_contribution_rate`. Set to `4`.
*   `REVIVE_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`: If `average_other_contribution_rate` falls below this (e.g., `0.35`), the strategy attempts to revive cooperation by contributing.
*   `ABANDONMENT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`: If, *after* a 'revive' contribution, the `average_other_contribution_rate` in the *next assessment window* is still below this (e.g., `0.20`), the strategy enters permanent abandonment mode. Note: `ABANDONMENT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` must be less than `REVIVE_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`.

**Internal State Variables (reset for each new game):**
*   `is_in_abandonment_mode`: Boolean, initialized to `False`.
*   `is_currently_attempting_revive`: Boolean, initialized to `False`. (Set to `True` when we contribute due to `REVIVE_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`).

**Decision Rules (for player `i` in `current_round`):**

1.  **If `current_round == r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** The game is ending; there is no future benefit to cooperation or reputation building. Defecting is the dominant strategy for maximal immediate payoff.

2.  **If `is_in_abandonment_mode` is `True`:**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** Previous attempts to foster cooperation have irrevocably failed, indicating a persistently uncooperative environment. Continuing to contribute would be highly detrimental and make this player a "sucker." This safeguards against universal defectors.

3.  **If `current_round <= LURE_ROUNDS` (Initial Lure Phase):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Proactively contribute to establish an initial cooperative environment. This "lure" aims to encourage other players, especially those with reciprocal or conditional cooperation strategies, to also contribute. This creates a public good pool that the strategy can then exploit.
    *   `is_currently_attempting_revive` is set to `False` (this is a setup phase, not a response to failure).

4.  **If `current_round > LURE_ROUNDS` and `current_round < r` (Exploitation Phase):**

    *   **Calculate `average_other_contribution_rate`:**
        *   Identify the rounds for assessment: from `max(LURE_ROUNDS + 1, current_round - ASSESSMENT_WINDOW)` up to `current_round - 1`.
        *   If no relevant history rounds are available (e.g., `current_round - 1 < LURE_ROUNDS + 1`), assume `average_other_contribution_rate = 0.0`.
        *   Otherwise, sum up all contributions from *all other players* (`j != i`) within these identified history rounds.
        *   `average_other_contribution_rate = (sum of all other players' contributions) / ((n-1) * number of identified history rounds)`.

    *   **Check for Failed Revival (if applicable):**
        *   If `is_currently_attempting_revive` was `True` *at the end of the previous round* (`current_round - 1`):
            *   This means *we* contributed in the previous round to try and revive cooperation. Now, we observe the outcome.
            *   If `average_other_contribution_rate < ABANDONMENT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`:
                *   Set `is_in_abandonment_mode = True`.
                *   Set `is_currently_attempting_revive = False`.
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** Our previous strategic contribution failed to sufficiently revive cooperation. The collective contribution level remains too low to warrant further investment. We abandon hope for cooperation and default to permanent defection to protect our payoff.

    *   **Main Decision Logic (if not already decided by abandonment):**
        *   If `is_in_abandonment_mode` is `False` and `average_other_contribution_rate < REVIVE_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   Set `is_currently_attempting_revive = True`.
            *   **Rationale:** Other players' contributions are critically low. This is a calculated, strategic investment to show good faith, attempt to re-engage other players, and prevent the total collapse of the public good (which would eliminate future free-riding opportunities). This is a "rescue" mission for the exploitation base.
        *   Else (if `is_in_abandonment_mode` is `False` and `average_other_contribution_rate >= REVIVE_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   Set `is_currently_attempting_revive = False`.
            *   **Rationale:** Cooperation levels among other players are acceptable or high enough. This allows for aggressive free-riding to maximize individual payoff without immediately jeopardizing the public good.

---
**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**
*   **Lure:** Initiate cooperation to build a pool to free-ride on.
*   **Free-Ride Default:** Continuously defect when others are contributing adequately.
*   **Strategic Revival:** Only contribute when cooperation is in danger of collapsing, acting as a minimal "life support" to preserve the public good for continued exploitation.
*   **Cut Losses:** Permanently defect if revival attempts fail, preventing self-exploitation.
*   **Final Round Defection:** Always defect in the last round, exploiting the end-game effect.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_25 = '''
Here is an exploitative strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust across various opponent behaviors.

---

**Strategy Name: The Opportunistic Free-Rider**

**Core Philosophy:** Prioritize immediate personal gain through defection. Only contribute strategically when it's a necessary, calculated investment to prevent the public good from entirely collapsing, thereby preserving future free-riding opportunities. This strategy is driven by self-interest, not genuine cooperation.

**Internal State (Resets at the start of each new game):**
*   `consecutive_defections_count`: An integer tracking how many rounds this strategy has consecutively chosen to Defect. (Starts at 0).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Last Round (`current_round == r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** There are no future interactions to influence or exploit. Maximizing immediate personal payoff dictates keeping the private endowment.

2.  **Early Rounds (e.g., `current_round <= 2`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   **Reasoning:** Establish a clear stance of self-interest from the outset. This tests the environment to see if other players are inclined to cooperate, and maximizes immediate payoff if they do.
    *   *Update State:* Increment `consecutive_defections_count`.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`2 < current_round < r`):**
    *   **Calculate `Average_Cooperation_Rate_Others`:**
        Determine the average proportion of *other* players (excluding this strategy) who contributed `C` in *all previous rounds*.
        (Sum of all `c_j` for `j != i` across all past rounds) / ((current_round - 1) * (n-1)).

    *   **Decision Logic:**

        *   **Scenario A: High Cooperation Environment (Aggressive Free-Ride)**
            *   If `Average_Cooperation_Rate_Others >= 0.6`:
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
                *   **Reasoning:** The environment is sufficiently cooperative, providing a robust public good to free-ride on. This strategy will take the guaranteed `+1` personal gain from defecting, as its individual defection is unlikely to significantly harm the overall collective benefit.
                *   *Update State:* Increment `consecutive_defections_count`.

        *   **Scenario B: Collapsing Cooperation (Strategic Nudge/Rescue)**
            *   If `Average_Cooperation_Rate_Others < 0.3`:
                *   If `consecutive_defections_count >= 3` (i.e., this strategy has defected for 3 or more rounds consecutively while the overall cooperation from others has dwindled significantly):
                    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
                    *   **Reasoning:** The public good is in danger of collapsing entirely, which would eliminate future free-riding opportunities. A strategic, temporary contribution is a calculated investment to potentially "reset" or encourage other players to restart cooperation. This is a short-term sacrifice made purely for the sake of preserving future, long-term self-gain.
                    *   *Update State:* Reset `consecutive_defections_count = 0`.
                *   Else (e.g., this strategy recently contributed, or has not defected consecutively for long enough in this low-cooperation environment):
                    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
                    *   **Reasoning:** Continue to free-ride, allowing other players another opportunity to increase their contributions. The strategy only intervenes if the collapse persists *and* it has been consistently defecting itself.
                    *   *Update State:* Increment `consecutive_defections_count`.

        *   **Scenario C: Moderate Cooperation (Default Free-Ride)**
            *   If `0.3 <= Average_Cooperation_Rate_Others < 0.6`:
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
                *   **Reasoning:** Cooperation is at a level where free-riding is still viable and profitable. Continue to exploit the system without intervention.
                *   *Update State:* Increment `consecutive_defections_count`.

**General Rule for `consecutive_defections_count`:**
*   If the strategy chooses to Defect (D) in a round, increment `consecutive_defections_count`.
*   If the strategy chooses to Contribute (C) in a round, reset `consecutive_defections_count` to 0.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_26 = '''
This strategy, named "The Opportunistic Shepherd," is designed to exploit the Public Goods Game by strategically oscillating between minimal cooperation (to induce or maintain contributions from others) and aggressive defection (to free-ride on those contributions). Its primary goal is to maximize its own individual payoff, not the collective welfare.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (where `1 < k < n`).

**Strategy Parameters (with default values for robustness):**
These parameters can be adjusted but are set to encourage exploitative behavior across various game dynamics.
*   **LURING_ROUNDS_INITIAL:** Number of initial rounds to contribute.
    *   *Default:* `max(1, min(3, floor(r * 0.1)))` (e.g., 1-3 rounds, or 10% of total rounds, whichever is less).
    *   *Purpose:* To signal willingness to cooperate initially, encouraging other players to contribute and establish a pool of public goods that this strategy can then exploit.
*   **LURING_ROUNDS_RESET:** Number of rounds to contribute when attempting to revive cooperation after a significant decline.
    *   *Default:* `1`
    *   *Purpose:* A minimal, low-cost attempt to "poke" the system and re-stimulate contributions from others, making the public good profitable to exploit again.
*   **DEFECTION_THRESHOLD_HIGH:** The minimum average contribution rate from *other* players in the previous round that triggers immediate defection.
    *   *Default:* `0.6` (i.e., if 60% or more of other players contributed).
    *   *Purpose:* To aggressively free-ride when a substantial portion of opponents are contributing, maximizing individual payoff.
*   **DEFECTION_THRESHOLD_LOW:** The maximum average contribution rate from *other* players in the previous round that triggers a "reset lure" (temporary cooperation).
    *   *Default:* `0.2` (i.e., if 20% or fewer of other players contributed).
    *   *Purpose:* To intervene and attempt to rebuild cooperation if contributions drop too low, ensuring there is still a public good worth exploiting.
*   **ENDGAME_ROUNDS:** The number of final rounds to always defect.
    *   *Default:* `max(1, min(3, floor(r * 0.1)))` (e.g., 1-3 rounds, or 10% of total rounds, whichever is less).
    *   *Purpose:* To maximize terminal payoff due to backward induction, as there are no future interactions to influence.

**Internal State Variables:**
The strategy maintains two internal state variables to track its current phase and progress:
*   `current_state`: Represents the current operational mode of the strategy. It can be one of:
    *   `"INITIAL_LURE"`: In the initial phase of establishing cooperation.
    *   `"EXPLOIT"`: Actively seeking to free-ride based on opponent behavior.
    *   `"RESET_LURE"`: Temporarily cooperating to revive flagging contributions.
*   `lure_countdown`: A counter indicating how many rounds are remaining in a "luring" phase.

**Initialization (before Round 1):**
*   Set `current_state = "INITIAL_LURE"`.
*   Set `lure_countdown = LURING_ROUNDS_INITIAL`.

---

**Decision Rules (for each round `t`, from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Endgame Phase Check:**
    *   If the current round `t` is greater than `r - ENDGAME_ROUNDS`:
        *   **Decision: Defect (D)**.
        *   *Exploitative Rationale:* In the final rounds, there is no strategic benefit to cooperation, as it cannot influence future interactions. Defecting maximizes immediate payoff by retaining the private token while still benefiting from any contributions made by others (though these are expected to be minimal in the endgame).

2.  **Initial Luring Phase:**
    *   Else if `current_state == "INITIAL_LURE"`:
        *   **Decision: Contribute (C)**.
        *   Decrement `lure_countdown`.
        *   If `lure_countdown` reaches 0, transition `current_state` to `"EXPLOIT"`.
        *   *Exploitative Rationale:* This initial, short period of cooperation is a strategic investment. By demonstrating early cooperation, the strategy aims to encourage other players to contribute, thereby creating a larger pool of public goods that this strategy intends to free-ride on in subsequent rounds. It's a calculated "bait."

3.  **Reset Luring Phase:**
    *   Else if `current_state == "RESET_LURE"`:
        *   **Decision: Contribute (C)**.
        *   Decrement `lure_countdown`.
        *   If `lure_countdown` reaches 0, transition `current_state` to `"EXPLOIT"`.
        *   *Exploitative Rationale:* When overall contributions from others have fallen below a profitable threshold, this brief cooperative period serves as a "reset" or "bait." It's a minimal, low-cost attempt to re-stimulate cooperation among other players, aiming to restore a higher level of public good so the strategy can return to a more profitable free-riding stance.

4.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase:**
    *   Else (meaning `current_state == "EXPLOIT"`):
        *   Calculate `avg_others_contrib` = (Sum of contributions from *all other players* in the *previous round*) / (`n-1`).
        *   **If `avg_others_contrib >= DEFECTION_THRESHOLD_HIGH`:**
            *   **Decision: Defect (D)**.
            *   *Exploitative Rationale:* Other players are contributing sufficiently, making it highly profitable to free-ride. The strategy gains its retained private token (1 payoff) while simultaneously benefiting from the public good created by others, maximizing its individual return.
        *   **Else if `avg_others_contrib <= DEFECTION_THRESHOLD_LOW`:**
            *   **Decision: Contribute (C)**.
            *   Transition `current_state` to `"RESET_LURE"`.
            *   Set `lure_countdown = LURING_ROUNDS_RESET - 1` (as the current round's contribution counts towards the reset).
            *   *Exploitative Rationale:* Cooperation from others has significantly declined, meaning there's little public good to exploit. To prevent a complete collapse of contributions (which would reduce the player's payoff to a mere 1 per round), the strategy temporarily contributes to "pump prime" the system, hoping to induce others to restart cooperating for future exploitation.
        *   **Else (`DEFECTION_THRESHOLD_LOW < avg_others_contrib < DEFECTION_THRESHOLD_HIGH`):**
            *   **Decision: Defect (D)**.
            *   *Exploitative Rationale:* In ambiguous zones where cooperation isn't strong enough to guarantee stable free-riding but also not weak enough to warrant a costly "reset," the strategy defaults to its primary exploitative mode: free-riding. It prioritizes immediate gain unless a clear incentive for a temporary, calculated investment in cooperation is present.

This strategy, named "Adaptive Exploiter," is designed to maximize personal gain in the Public Goods Game by strategically leveraging cooperation from other players. It operates in three distinct phases: an initial probing phase to gauge and encourage cooperation, an adaptive exploitation phase that free-rides when possible and "re-educates" when necessary, and a final endgame phase for pure self-interest.

**Strategy Parameters (Illustrative Values):**
The following values are illustrative. In a real implementation, some might be dynamically calculated based on `r` (total rounds) for optimal performance across game lengths (e.g., `PROBE_ROUNDS` could be `max(1, min(3, floor(r/5)))`). For clarity, we'll use fixed values here:
*   **`PROBE_ROUNDS`**: 3 (initial rounds to contribute)
*   **`ASSESSMENT_WINDOW`**: 5 (number of most recent rounds to evaluate opponent behavior)
*   **`COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`**: 0.5 (average cooperation rate of other players below which this strategy will contribute)
*   **`ENDGAME_ROUNDS`**: 3 (number of final rounds to always defect)

---

**Decision Rules (for player 'i' in round 't', from 1 to 'r'):**

1.  **Endgame Phase (Rounds `r - ENDGAME_ROUNDS + 1` to `r`):**
    If the current round `t` is greater than `r - ENDGAME_ROUNDS`:
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the final rounds of a finite game, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. Therefore, the strategy maximizes immediate payoff by always defecting, as this is the dominant action for a single round regardless of others' choices.

2.  **Initial Probing Phase (Rounds 1 to `PROBE_ROUNDS`):**
    Else if the current round `t` is less than or equal to `PROBE_ROUNDS`:
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This strategy begins by contributing to signal a willingness to cooperate. The goal is to encourage other players to contribute themselves, thereby establishing a cooperative environment that can be exploited in later rounds. This is a strategic investment to "bait" others into contributing.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (Remaining rounds):**
    Else (the current round `t` is between `PROBE_ROUNDS + 1` and `r - ENDGAME_ROUNDS`):
    *   **Assess Opponent Cooperation:**
        *   Examine the actions of all *other* `(n-1)` players from the `ASSESSMENT_WINDOW` most recent rounds (i.e., from `max(1, t - ASSESSMENT_WINDOW)` up to `t - 1`).
        *   Calculate the `Average_Others_Cooperation_Rate`: This is the total number of contributions made by other players in the `ASSESSMENT_WINDOW` divided by the maximum possible contributions from others in that window (which is `(n - 1) * (number of rounds in the window)`).

    *   **Decision Based on Assessment:**
        *   If the `Average_Others_Cooperation_Rate` is greater than or equal to the `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* Other players are demonstrating a sufficient level of cooperation. This creates an optimal opportunity for the "Adaptive Exploiter" to free-ride, maximizing its own payoff by benefiting from others' contributions without incurring the cost of contributing itself. This is the core exploitative action.
        *   Else (if the `Average_Others_Cooperation_Rate` is less than the `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* Cooperation among other players is currently low. By contributing, this strategy attempts to "re-educate" or stimulate cooperation. It acts as a strategic investment to encourage others to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds, thereby creating future opportunities for this strategy to revert to free-riding and exploitation.

---

**Robustness and Adaptability:**
The "Adaptive Exploiter" is robust because it does not assume specific opponent strategies. Instead, it continuously monitors the aggregate level of cooperation from other players and adjusts its own behavior accordingly. It can effectively handle a wide range of opponent behaviors, including purely defecting, purely cooperating, or conditionally cooperating strategies (like Tit-for-Tat). Its adaptive nature allows it to recover from periods of low cooperation, or even breakdown, and strategically re-establish conditions favorable for its own exploitation.

**Exploitative Alignment:**
This strategy is explicitly exploitative. Its primary objective is always to maximize its own individual payoff. Any instances of contribution are purely strategic – they are a calculated means to an end, designed to induce or restore a level of collective contribution from others that can then be exploited for personal gain. It never contributes out of genuine altruism or for collective welfare, but solely for its own self-interest, particularly in the critical endgame phase where exploitation is absolute.

Strategy Name: The Adaptive Exploiter

This strategy is designed to maximize personal gain in the Public Goods Game by strategically leveraging cooperation from other players while minimizing its own contributions. It operates on a dynamic "bait-exploit-re-bait" cycle, adapting to the collective behavior of opponents.

**Game Parameters:**
-   `n`: Number of players.
-   `r`: Total number of rounds.
-   `k`: Multiplier (where `1 < k < n`).

**Strategy Parameters (calculated at the start of the game):**
-   `InitialBaitRounds`: An integer representing the number of initial rounds this strategy will contribute. This is to establish an initial signal of cooperation and encourage others to contribute. It is calculated as `max(1, min(3, floor(r / 3)))`, ensuring a reasonable but not excessive initial investment, adaptable to game length.
-   `ExploitationThreshold_Ratio`: A float (e.g., 0.5) representing the minimum fraction of *other players* who must have contributed in the *previous round* for the environment to be considered sufficiently cooperative for exploitation.
-   `ExploitationThreshold`: An integer calculated as `max(1, floor((n - 1) * ExploitationThreshold_Ratio))`. This is the absolute minimum number of contributions from other players required to trigger or continue exploitation.

**Internal State Variables (reset at the start of each new game):**
-   `my_last_action_was_C`: A boolean. `true` if this strategy contributed ('C') in the previous round, `false` if it defected ('D'). This is initialized to `false` before Round 1.

---

**Decision Rules (executed at the beginning of each `current_round_number`):**

1.  **Last Round (`current_round_number == r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. The individually rational and purely exploitative choice is to maximize immediate payoff by defecting, regardless of prior history or potential future consequences.
    *   **Update State:** (No update needed as the game ends).

2.  **First Round (`current_round_number == 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Reasoning:** This action initiates the "baiting" phase. Contributing in the first round serves as a signal of a willingness to cooperate, which is crucial for encouraging other players to contribute and thus creating a valuable public good for future exploitation.
    *   **Update State:** Set `my_last_action_was_C = true`.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < current_round_number < r`):**

    *   **Information Gathering:** Before making a decision for the current round, observe `S_others_prev_round`, which is the total sum of contributions from all players *except this strategy* in `current_round_number - 1`.

    *   **Phase A: Initial Baiting (Early Rounds)**
        *   **If `current_round_number <= InitialBaitRounds`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Reasoning:** Continue with the pre-determined initial baiting strategy. This phase is critical for establishing or confirming a sufficiently cooperative environment that can later be exploited.
            *   **Update State:** Set `my_last_action_was_C = true`.

    *   **Phase B: Adaptive Exploitation (Main Game Logic)**
        *   **Else (`current_round_number > InitialBaitRounds`):**

            *   **Rule B.1: Re-Baiting after a Breakdown in Cooperation:**
                *   **If `my_last_action_was_C` is `false` (meaning this strategy chose to defect in the previous round)**
                *   **AND `S_others_prev_round < ExploitationThreshold` (meaning the collective contribution from other players fell below the acceptable level after my defection):**
                    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                    *   **Reasoning:** This is a "forgiveness" or "re-baiting" move. It suggests that this strategy's previous exploitation attempt likely caused a negative reaction from others, leading to a decrease in their contributions. By contributing again, the strategy attempts to re-establish a cooperative environment, thereby creating a new public good pool that can be exploited in subsequent rounds.
                    *   **Update State:** Set `my_last_action_was_C = true`.

            *   **Rule B.2: Continued Exploitation or Default Defection:**
                *   **Else (If Rule B.1 conditions are not met, meaning either I cooperated last round, or my previous defection did not cause a sufficient drop in others' contributions):**
                    *   **If `S_others_prev_round >= ExploitationThreshold`:**
                        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                        *   **Reasoning:** Others are contributing sufficiently. This is the optimal time to exploit their contributions by defecting, maximizing personal payoff without incurring a cost.
                        *   **Update State:** Set `my_last_action_was_C = false`.
                    *   **Else (`S_others_prev_round < ExploitationThreshold`):**
                        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                        *   **Reasoning:** Others are not contributing enough to create a substantial public good worth contributing to, even after this strategy's previous attempts to cooperate or re-bait them. In such a scenario, minimizing personal cost by defecting is the most rational exploitative choice.
                        *   **Update State:** Set `my_last_action_was_C = false`.

---

**Alignment with an Exploitative Mindset:**

This strategy clearly embodies an exploitative mindset by:

1.  **Conditional Cooperation for Gain:** It never contributes out of pure altruism. Any instance of contributing ('C') serves a calculated, strategic purpose: either to build trust and create an exploitable public good initially, or to "re-bait" others into cooperation after an exploitation attempt has led to a breakdown.
2.  **Default Defection:** Once cooperation is established, or if it cannot be established, the strategy's primary mode is to defect ('D'). This maximizes its individual payoff by free-riding on others' contributions or minimizing its losses when others are not contributing.
3.  **Adaptive Self-Interest:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed actions of others, ensuring it always seeks to optimize its own returns. It's not rigid but ruthlessly opportunistic.
4.  **No Reciprocity Beyond Exploitation:** While it may appear to reciprocate cooperation by re-baiting, this is not true reciprocity. It is a strategic manipulation to restore a profitable environment for future free-riding, not an act of shared welfare.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_29 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Opportunist," is designed to maximize individual payoff by predominantly free-riding on the contributions of others. It carefully monitors the collective behavior of other players, only contributing when strategically necessary to prevent a collapse of the public good that would eliminate free-riding opportunities, and then quickly reverts to defecting.

**Strategy: Adaptive Opportunist**

**Parameters:**

*   **`WINDOW_FOR_AVERAGE`**: The number of most recent rounds to consider when calculating the average level of cooperation from other players. (Recommended: 3 rounds. Adjust dynamically if fewer rounds have passed).
*   **`EXPL_THRESHOLD_COUNT`**: The minimum number of *other* players whose average contribution triggers aggressive free-riding. If the average contributions from others meet or exceed this, it signals a strong collective good to exploit. (Calculated as: `MAX(1, CEIL(0.6 * (n-1)))`).
*   **`COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD_COUNT`**: The maximum number of *other* players whose average contribution signals a collective good that is too weak to bother trying to maintain. Below this, contributing is considered futile. (Calculated as: `FLOOR(0.2 * (n-1))`).
*   **`LURE_DURATION`**: The number of rounds to contribute when the strategy decides to "lure" or "re-seed" cooperation. (Recommended: 1 round for maximal exploitation, 2 for slightly more robustness).

**Internal State:**

*   **`rounds_to_lure`**: An integer counter, initialized to 0. This tracks how many more rounds the strategy is committed to contributing as part of a "lure" phase.

**Decision Rules (for player `i` in round `t`):**

1.  **First Round (`t=1`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**. This is the individually rational choice in a single-shot game and serves as an initial test of the other players' willingness to contribute, without any cost to player `i`.

2.  **Last Round (`t=r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**. There are no future rounds for retaliation or benefit from maintaining cooperation, so player `i` will always choose to free-ride.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t < r`):**

    *   **Update `rounds_to_lure`:** If `rounds_to_lure > 0` (meaning player `i` is currently in a "lure" phase), decrement `rounds_to_lure` by 1.

    *   **Phase 1: Currently Luring (Committed Contribution)**
        *   If `rounds_to_lure > 0`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**. Player `i` continues its temporary contribution to try and stabilize or boost overall cooperation, as previously decided.

    *   **Phase 2: Evaluate and Decide (Default to Defect)**
        *   Else (`rounds_to_lure == 0`, player `i` is not currently committed to luring):
            *   **Gather Information:**
                *   `Current_Other_Contributions`: The number of *other* players (`j != i`) who contributed (C) in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
                *   `Avg_Other_Contributions`: The average number of *other* players (`j != i`) who contributed (C) over the past `WINDOW_FOR_AVERAGE` rounds. (If `t-1 < WINDOW_FOR_AVERAGE`, use `t-1` as the window size).

            *   **Scenario A: High Cooperation (Exploit Maximally)**
                *   If `Avg_Other_Contributions >= EXPL_THRESHOLD_COUNT`:
                    *   **Action: Defect (D)**. The group is providing a substantial public good; player `i` will free-ride without contributing.

            *   **Scenario B: Cooperation Collapse (Give Up)**
                *   If `Avg_Other_Contributions <= COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD_COUNT`:
                    *   **Action: Defect (D)**. Cooperation levels are too low to be worth player `i`'s contribution. Player `i` cuts its losses and does not contribute.

            *   **Scenario C: Fragile Cooperation (Strategic Intervention)**
                *   Else (`COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD_COUNT < Avg_Other_Contributions < EXPL_THRESHOLD_COUNT`):
                    *   This indicates a moderate level of cooperation that is worth preserving, but might be unstable. Player `i` checks for signs of decline.
                    *   **Check Trend:** If `Current_Other_Contributions < Avg_Other_Contributions` (i.e., cooperation is actively trending downwards within this fragile range):
                        *   **Initiate Lure:** Set `rounds_to_lure = LURE_DURATION`.
                        *   **Action: Contribute (C)**. Player `i` makes a strategic contribution to try and prevent further decline and encourage other players to continue cooperating, thereby preserving future free-riding opportunities.
                    *   **Else (Cooperation is stable or improving within the fragile range):**
                        *   **Action: Defect (D)**. Player `i` continues to free-ride. It will only contribute if the trend indicates that cooperation is actively weakening.

**Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:**

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy's default action is always to Defect, which is the individually rational choice in a single-shot PGG.
*   **Free-Riding Optimization:** It actively seeks to exploit high levels of cooperation (`EXPL_THRESHOLD_COUNT`) by always defecting.
*   **Strategic, Minimal Contribution:** It only contributes under specific conditions where collective cooperation is *fragile and declining*, and a temporary contribution might prevent a complete breakdown, thereby preserving the *opportunity for future free-riding*. These contributions are limited in duration (`LURE_DURATION`).
*   **Cut Losses:** If cooperation is too low (`COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD_COUNT`), it deems further contributions as futile, prioritizing individual preservation over attempting to salvage a lost cause.
*   **No Altruism or Punishment:** The strategy does not aim to punish defectors or reward cooperators; its actions are purely self-serving, designed to manipulate the environment for its own benefit.

The Opportunistic Defector with a Trigger

This strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff in the Public Goods Game by aggressively free-riding when conditions permit, while adaptively and strategically contributing only when necessary to foster or restore a cooperative environment that can be subsequently exploited. It leverages historical information to manipulate collective behavior towards a state beneficial for the individual.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).** (Contribute 1 token).
    *   *Reasoning:* This initial contribution serves as a low-cost "bait" or signal of potential cooperation. It aims to encourage conditional cooperators among opponents to start contributing, providing an initial data point for assessing the opponent pool and setting the stage for future exploitation.

*   **Rounds 2 to r-1 (Adaptive Exploitation Phase):**
    *   **Calculate Effective Contribution Rate of Others (ECRO):** Determine the proportion of *other players* (excluding self) who contributed in the *immediately preceding round*.
        `ECRO = (Sum of contributions c_j for all j != self in the previous round) / (n - 1)`
    *   **Determine Action based on ECRO:**
        *   **If `ECRO >= 0.75` (High Cooperation Threshold):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).** (Contribute 0 tokens).
            *   *Reasoning:* When a high proportion of other players are contributing, the public good is sufficiently funded. My individual best response is to free-ride, maximizing my current round's payoff by receiving benefits without incurring cost. This is the primary exploitative mode.
        *   **Else If `ECRO < 0.25` (Low Cooperation Threshold / Abandonment Point):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).** (Contribute 0 tokens).
            *   *Reasoning:* If the collective contribution from others falls below a critical minimum, the public good is too depleted to warrant my individual investment. Contributing in this scenario would likely result in an unreciprocated loss. Defecting minimizes my losses when cooperation is too low to be worth influencing.
        *   **Else (`0.25 <= ECRO < 0.75`) (Mid-Range / Inducement Phase):**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).** (Contribute 1 token).
            *   *Reasoning:* In this moderate range of cooperation, others are not contributing enough for aggressive free-riding, but they are also not entirely uncooperative. This strategic contribution acts as an "inducement" or "nudge" to encourage other players to increase their contributions, aiming to move the `ECRO` back into the "High Cooperation" range in subsequent rounds, which would allow me to resume free-riding.

*   **Round r (Final Defection):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   *Reasoning:* In the final round of a finitely repeated game, there are no future rounds to influence. The strictly dominant strategy for this single-shot game is to defect, maximizing the final round's payoff.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
*   The strategy explicitly defines behavior for the first round (initial probe) and the last round (final defection), ensuring no ambiguity for these edge cases. The adaptive logic using `ECRO` is applied only to the intermediate rounds, which have a preceding round's history.

**3. Exploitative Alignment:**
*   This strategy is fundamentally exploitative by defaulting to defection whenever the public good is adequately funded by others.
*   Its contributions are purely strategic investments, designed to manipulate opponent behavior to create conditions favorable for future free-riding, rather than out of genuine cooperation.
*   It is robust against purely uncooperative opponents by ceasing contributions when the public good is too low to be worth salvaging.
*   It is adaptive to a wide range of opponent behaviors, seeking to identify and leverage patterns of cooperation while minimizing personal cost.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_31 = '''
This strategy, named "The Conditional Predator," is designed to be exploitative, adaptive, and robust by strategically leveraging others' willingness to cooperate while minimizing its own contributions. It aims to provoke an environment where free-riding is highly profitable.

**Strategy Name:** The Conditional Predator

**Core Principle:** Attempt to free-ride on others' contributions when cooperation is detected. If the environment becomes uncooperative, revert to consistent defection to minimize losses. A single, calculated initial probe is used to prime a cooperative environment for later exploitation.

**Parameters:**

*   **`CooperationThreshold`:** The minimum proportion of *other players* who must have contributed in the previous round for the strategy to enter its active exploitation (free-riding) phase. A robust value for this is **0.5** (meaning at least half of the other players contributed). This threshold ensures that the public good generated by others is substantial enough to warrant active free-riding.

**Decision Rules (for player *i*):**

1.  **Initial Probe (Round `t = 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This is a single, calculated investment to 'test the waters' for conditional cooperators. By contributing once, the strategy aims to signal potential cooperation, thereby encouraging other players (especially those employing Tit-for-Tat or similar conditional strategies) to also contribute. If this probe is successful, it creates a more cooperative environment that can be exploited in subsequent rounds. This is a strategic 'bait' rather than genuine cooperation, accepting a temporary individual loss (`1 - k/n`) for the potential of greater future gains through free-riding.

2.  **Last Round (Round `t = r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to consider. The dominant strategy for any individual player is to defect, maximizing immediate payoff (`1 + (k/n) * sum_j c_j`) without concern for repercussions.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round `t` from `2` to `r-1`):**

    *   **Monitor Other Players' Behavior:**
        *   Calculate `P_others_cooperated_prev`: This is the proportion of *other players* (`j != i`) who contributed in the *immediately preceding round (`t-1`)*.
        *   `P_others_cooperated_prev = (sum_{j!=i} c_j_prev) / (n-1)`

    *   **Evaluate Exploitation Opportunity:**

        *   **If `P_others_cooperated_prev >= CooperationThreshold`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** A sufficient number of other players are contributing, indicating a stable-enough cooperative environment ripe for exploitation. This strategy capitalizes on this by free-riding, consistently choosing the individually dominant action (Defect) to maximize its payoff from the public good created by others, plus its kept token. This is the core exploitation phase.

        *   **Else (`P_others_cooperated_prev < CooperationThreshold`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** The level of cooperation from other players is too low to provide significant public good, or it indicates a collapse of cooperation. In such an environment, contributing would be a net loss (`1 - k/n`) for player *i* without sufficient compensatory public good from others. Therefore, the strategy reverts to consistent defection to minimize individual losses, avoiding being a "sucker" in an uncooperative game. This is a defensive defection phase.

**Summary of Exploitative Alignment:**

*   **Minimizes Own Contribution:** The strategy contributes only once (in Round 1) as a calculated probe. In all other rounds, it defects.
*   **Leverages Others' Cooperation:** It actively free-rides by defecting when it observes sufficient contributions from other players, directly benefiting from their investment in the public good without reciprocating.
*   **Avoids Being Exploited:** When cooperation from others is too low, the strategy switches to consistent defection, ensuring it does not contribute tokens pointlessly and thus avoids being a "sucker."
*   **Adaptive Rationality:** The single initial contribution is a strategic investment to *create* an environment for exploitation. Its subsequent decisions to defect are adaptive, shifting between "free-riding defection" and "defensive defection" based on the observed collective behavior, always optimizing for its own payoff under the `1 - k/n > 0` condition.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_32 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Predator," aims to maximize individual payoff by consistently free-riding on others' contributions. It strategically contributes only when necessary to prevent the complete collapse of the common pool, thereby preserving future opportunities for exploitation. It is designed to be adaptive to varying levels of cooperation among opponents and robust across different game parameters.

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Predator**

**Game Parameters (available from rules):**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n)

**Internal State (derived from history after each round):**
*   `current_round`: The current round number (1 to `r`).
*   `my_previous_action`: My action (C for Contribute, D for Defect) in the immediately preceding round. (Defaults to D for round 1).
*   `others_contributions_prev_round`: The sum of contributions from all *other* `(n-1)` players in the immediately preceding round.
*   `others_contributions_history`: A historical record of `others_contributions_prev_round` for all past rounds.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Initial Probe Phase (Rounds 1 to `max(3, floor(r / 10))`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This phase establishes the default behavior as defection, allowing the strategy to observe the initial inclinations of other players (e.g., unconditional cooperators, initial defectors) without incurring any personal cost. This maximizes early-game payoff and probes for free-riding opportunities.

2.  **End Game Phase (Rounds `r - max(3, floor(r / 10))` + 1 to `r`):**
    *   **Decision:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* As there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation, standard backward induction applies. Contributing in these final rounds would only diminish personal payoff without any prospect of future benefits from increased cooperation.

3.  **Exploitation & Maintenance Phase (All other rounds, between Initial Probe and End Game):**
    *   This is the core adaptive phase where the strategy attempts to free-ride while intelligently preventing the complete collapse of the public good.
    *   **Calculate `others_contributions_recent_avg`**: Average of `others_contributions_prev_round` over the past `min(5, current_round - 1)` rounds. If `current_round` is 2, this is simply `others_contributions_prev_round` from round 1.
    *   **Define `MIN_VIABLE_COOPERATION`**: `max(1, floor((n - 1) * 0.1))`. (This represents a minimum level of collective contribution from others to make individual contribution potentially worthwhile, ensuring it's at least 1).
    *   **Define `CRITICAL_DROP_FACTOR`**: `0.7`. (Represents a 30% drop from the recent average).

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **Scenario A: Cooperation is too low to be exploited.**
            *   If `others_contributions_prev_round <= MIN_VIABLE_COOPERATION`:
                *   **Decision: Defect (D)**.
                *   *Rationale:* The level of cooperation from others is too negligible. My single contribution would likely not significantly impact the total pool and would simply be a personal loss. It's more exploitative to preserve my token.
        *   **Scenario B: Cooperation is declining significantly, but not yet collapsed.**
            *   If `others_contributions_prev_round < others_contributions_recent_avg * CRITICAL_DROP_FACTOR`
            *   **AND** `others_contributions_prev_round > MIN_VIABLE_COOPERATION` (i.e., not already catastrophically low, but in decline)
            *   **AND** `my_previous_action` was Defect (to ensure this is a reactive "re-priming" and not sustained cooperation).
            *   **Decision: Contribute (C)** for this round.
            *   *Rationale:* This is a calculated "investment." By making a single contribution, the strategy attempts to signal a potential return to cooperation, hoping to encourage other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds. This intervention is purely self-serving, aimed at restoring a viable common pool for future free-riding, and is only made if the strategy was defecting previously (to avoid becoming a consistent cooperator).
        *   **Scenario C: All other situations (cooperation is stable, increasing, or sufficiently high).**
            *   **Decision: Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* In these ideal conditions, the public good is healthy enough to be freely exploited. The strategy maximizes its individual payoff by withholding its contribution and fully benefiting from the contributions of others. There is no immediate need to "prime the pump" or signal cooperation.

Strategy Name: The Adaptive Free-Rider

This strategy is designed to maximize its own payoff in the Public Goods Game by consistently attempting to free-ride on the contributions of other players. It employs a dynamic approach: defaulting to defection, making strategic contributions only when necessary to prevent the complete collapse of the public good (thereby maintaining a pool to free-ride from), and exploiting the game's finite nature by defecting unconditionally in the final rounds. The strategy adapts based on the observed actions of other players.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n)

**History Available:**
*   `c_{j, t'}`: Player `j`'s contribution (1 for C, 0 for D) in any past round `t' < current_round`.

**Internal Strategy Parameters:**
These parameters are fixed components of this strategy's design, not game-specific inputs for each tournament.
*   `Reactivation_Threshold_Proportion`: (Default: 0.25) This is the minimum proportion of *other players* who must have contributed in the *immediately preceding round* for this strategy to continue its default action of defecting. If the observed proportion of contributing opponents falls below this threshold, the strategy considers a "re-engagement" contribution.
*   `Endgame_Start_Offset`: (Default: 3) This defines how many rounds before the very last round the unconditional defection phase begins.
    *   **Calculated:** `Endgame_Start_Round = max(1, r - Endgame_Start_Offset)`

---

**Decision Rules (for current_round 't'):**

1.  **Round 1 (t = 1):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale (Exploitative):** The strategy begins by taking the individually dominant action in a single-shot game. This allows it to immediately benefit if other players are cooperative from the outset, without incurring any personal cost. It serves as a low-risk observation round to gauge the initial cooperative tendencies of opponents.

2.  **Early to Mid-Game (1 < t < Endgame_Start_Round):**
    *   **Observe Others' Behavior:**
        *   Calculate `sum_others_contributed_last_round = sum_{j != i} c_{j, t-1}` (the sum of contributions from all other players in the immediately preceding round).
        *   Calculate `P_others_contributed = sum_others_contributed_last_round / (n - 1)`. This represents the proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `P_others_contributed >= Reactivation_Threshold_Proportion`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale (Exploitative):** A sufficient number of other players are contributing to the public good. The strategy free-rides on their cooperation, minimizing its own cost while maximizing its current payoff from the shared pool.
        *   **Else (`P_others_contributed < Reactivation_Threshold_Proportion`):**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale (Calculated Exploitation):** The proportion of contributing players has fallen below the threshold, indicating that the public good is shrinking. If left unchecked, this trend would severely reduce the future potential for free-riding. This strategy makes a strategic "re-engagement" contribution. The aim is to signal potential cooperation to conditional cooperators among opponents (e.g., Tit-for-Tat or similar reciprocal strategies), thereby encouraging them to contribute more in subsequent rounds. This is a calculated, short-term investment made to "re-seed" the public good, hoping to restore it to a level where the strategy can profitably resume its default free-riding behavior in later rounds. This action is only taken when there are enough remaining rounds for this investment to potentially yield future benefits (i.e., not in the endgame).

3.  **Endgame (t >= Endgame_Start_Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale (Pure Exploitation):** In the final rounds of a finite game, the incentives for conditional cooperation diminish significantly due to backward induction. Rational players anticipate future defection. This strategy fully exploits this dynamic by unconditionally defecting to maximize its final payoffs, regardless of past contributions or the current state of the public good, as there are no longer future benefits to consider.

This strategy, named "The Predatory Stabilizer," is designed to maximize individual payoff by primarily free-riding, while making calculated, minimal investments to prevent the complete collapse of the public good that it seeks to exploit. It adapts to the observed level of cooperation and rationally exits cooperation in the endgame.

**Strategy: The Predatory Stabilizer**

**1. Game Parameters & State Tracking:**
*   `n`: Number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for public good (where `1 < k < n`).
*   `current_round`: The current round number.
*   `C_others_rate_prev`: The average contribution rate of *all other players* in the previous round. This is calculated as `(sum of contributions from players other than me in the previous round) / (n - 1)`.
*   `My_last_action`: My own action (Contribute 'C' or Defect 'D') in the previous round. Initialize as 'None' for the first round.

**2. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** Start by free-riding to establish a high baseline payoff and test the generosity and strategies of other players without personal cost.
    *   Update `My_last_action` to `D`.

*   **Rounds 2 to `r - 2` (Main Exploitation Phase):**
    *   **Calculate `C_others_rate_prev`**.
    *   **Exploitation Threshold (`T_rate_exploit`):**
        *   Set `T_rate_exploit = 0.3`. This represents a low minimum average contribution rate from others (30%) that the strategy considers sufficient for profitable free-riding. If the collective contribution from others falls below this, it triggers a consideration for intervention.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `C_others_rate_prev >= T_rate_exploit`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** Others are contributing enough. The public good is sufficiently robust to exploit. Continue to free-ride and maximize immediate payoff.
        *   **If `C_others_rate_prev < T_rate_exploit`:**
            *   **Rationale:** The public good is too diminished. Continued pure free-riding at this low level of collective contribution might not be profitable, as there's little to gain. A strategic intervention might be necessary to "stabilize" the public good for future exploitation, but only if I haven't already tried to stabilize it without success.
            *   **If `My_last_action` was `C` (in the previous round):**
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
                *   **Rationale:** I tried to "kick-start" cooperation in the previous round by contributing, but `C_others_rate_prev` is still below the threshold. This indicates others are either highly uncooperative or unresponsive to my signal. Continuing to contribute would be a wasted investment. Cut losses and revert to defection.
            *   **If `My_last_action` was `D` (in the previous round):**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
                *   **Rationale:** This is my first potential intervention attempt after contributions dropped below the exploitative threshold. I will make a single "priming" contribution. This is a minimal, calculated investment to try and encourage others to increase their cooperation, hoping to rebuild the public good to a level where it can be profitably exploited again.
    *   After deciding the action for the current round, update `My_last_action` accordingly.

*   **Rounds `r - 1` and `r` (Endgame Defection Phase):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds, the "shadow of the future" is too short to incentivize cooperation. Rational players will anticipate universal defection. Any contribution now is a pure cost without the possibility of future reciprocal benefits. Maximize the final rounds' payoff by defecting.
    *   Update `My_last_action` to `D`.

**3. Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:**
*   **Default to Free-Riding:** The primary mode of operation is to defect, taking advantage of others' contributions without incurring cost.
*   **Strategic, Minimal Investment:** Contributions are not made out of generosity but as a calculated, temporary sacrifice. They occur only when the collective good is so low that continuing to free-ride is no longer profitable, aiming to "stabilize" the environment for future exploitation.
*   **Loss Aversion:** If a priming contribution fails to improve others' cooperation, the strategy quickly reverts to defection, minimizing personal losses.
*   **Endgame Exploitation:** Leverages the well-known endgame effect of finitely repeated games to ensure maximum personal gain when future reciprocity is impossible.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_35 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Free-Rider (AFR)," is designed to exploit cooperative tendencies in other players while minimizing personal contributions. It operates by probing for cooperation, free-riding when possible, and strategically re-initiating cooperation only to resume exploitation. It adapts to the observed average behavior of other players.

---

**The Adaptive Free-Rider (AFR) Strategy Description**

The AFR strategy maintains an internal `Mode` to track its current strategic objective and a `Round_in_mode` counter.

**Internal Parameters:**
*   `N_PROBE_ROUNDS = 1`: Number of initial rounds to play cooperatively to assess the environment.
*   `N_RECALIBRATE_ROUNDS = 2`: Number of rounds to play cooperatively when attempting to re-establish a cooperative environment.
*   `THRESHOLD_HIGH = 0.7`: If this proportion or more of other players cooperated in the previous round, the environment is deemed sufficiently cooperative for exploitation.
*   `THRESHOLD_LOW = 0.4`: If less than this proportion of other players cooperated in the previous round, the environment is considered uncooperative, requiring an attempt to recalibrate.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Last Round (`current_round == r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions for punishment or reward, so the individually rational action is to defect, maximizing immediate payoff without consequence.

2.  **First Round (`current_round == 1`):**
    *   **Internal State:** Set `Mode = PROBE`, `Round_in_mode = 1`.
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution serves as a probe to signal potential for cooperation and gather data on opponents' initial tendencies. It's an investment to identify an exploitable environment.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < current_round < r`):**
    *   Let `P_others_prev` be the proportion of other players who contributed in the *previous round*. This is calculated as `(sum of c_j for j != i in previous round) / (n-1)`.

    *   **If `Mode == PROBE`:**
        *   If `Round_in_mode < N_PROBE_ROUNDS`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Update:** Increment `Round_in_mode`.
        *   Else (`Round_in_mode == N_PROBE_ROUNDS`): // End of the initial probing phase
            *   If `P_others_prev >= THRESHOLD_HIGH`:
                *   **Internal State:** Set `Mode = EXPLOIT`, `Round_in_mode = 1`.
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   Else (`P_others_prev < THRESHOLD_HIGH`):
                *   **Internal State:** Set `Mode = RECALIBRATE`, `Round_in_mode = 1`.
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   *Rationale:* After the probe, the strategy decides whether to directly exploit a highly cooperative environment or try to build one if initial cooperation is insufficient.

    *   **If `Mode == EXPLOIT`:**
        *   If `P_others_prev >= THRESHOLD_LOW`:
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Update:** Increment `Round_in_mode`.
        *   Else (`P_others_prev < THRESHOLD_LOW`): // Cooperation has dropped too low to effectively free-ride
            *   **Internal State:** Set `Mode = RECALIBRATE`, `Round_in_mode = 1`.
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   *Rationale:* When others' cooperation is sufficiently high, the strategy defects to maximize its own payoff. If cooperation drops, it temporarily stops exploiting and attempts to "nudge" others back to cooperation.

    *   **If `Mode == RECALIBRATE`:**
        *   If `Round_in_mode < N_RECALIBRATE_ROUNDS`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Update:** Increment `Round_in_mode`.
        *   Else (`Round_in_mode == N_RECALIBRATE_ROUNDS`): // End of the recalibration attempt
            *   If `P_others_prev >= THRESHOLD_HIGH`: // Recalibration attempt was successful
                *   **Internal State:** Set `Mode = EXPLOIT`, `Round_in_mode = 1`.
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   Else (`P_others_prev < THRESHOLD_HIGH`): // Recalibration failed to restore high cooperation
                *   **Internal State:** Set `Mode = EXPLOIT`, `Round_in_mode = 1`. // Default to self-preservation
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   *Rationale:* This phase involves strategically contributing to encourage others to resume cooperation. If this "lead by example" approach works, the strategy immediately reverts to exploitation. If it fails (cooperation remains low after `N_RECALIBRATE_ROUNDS`), the strategy cuts its losses and defects, assuming it cannot effectively induce cooperation in this environment.

---

**Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:**

*   **Strategic Cooperation:** Any instance of contributing (C) by AFR is not driven by altruism, but by a calculated effort to either identify an exploitable environment (`PROBE` mode) or to manipulate other players back into a state where they are contributing and can be free-ridden upon (`RECALIBRATE` mode).
*   **Direct Free-Riding:** The `EXPLOIT` mode is the core of the strategy, where AFR explicitly defects while others are contributing, directly benefiting from their generosity.
*   **Self-Preservation:** If attempts to induce cooperation fail, AFR defaults to defection, preventing it from being a "sucker" in an uncooperative environment.
*   **End-Game Defection:** The final round defection is a standard exploitative move in finite repeated games.

This strategy is adaptive because its actions are entirely conditional on the observed behavior of other players. It is robust because it doesn't assume specific opponent types but instead reacts to the collective level of cooperation.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_36 = '''
Here is an exploitative strategy designed for the Public Goods Game, focusing on maximizing individual payoff by free-riding whenever possible, while adaptively intervening to prevent a complete collapse of cooperation that would ultimately harm its own long-term gains.

---

### Strategy: The Responsive Manipulator

This strategy aims to exploit other players' willingness to contribute, only contributing itself when necessary to "prime the pump" or prevent the public good from entirely collapsing, thus preserving a pool to free-ride from in subsequent rounds. It is adaptive to the observed behavior of opponents and includes mechanisms to prevent itself from being continuously exploited by persistent defectors.

**1. Strategy Parameters:**

*   **Exploitation Threshold (ET):** A float between 0 and 1 (e.g., `ET = 0.3`). This threshold determines the minimum proportion of *other* players who must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to continue free-riding. If the proportion of contributing opponents falls below `ET`, the strategy considers contributing itself to stimulate cooperation. A lower `ET` indicates a higher tolerance for others' defection before intervention.
*   **Patience Threshold (PT):** An integer (e.g., `PT = 2`). This represents the maximum number of consecutive rounds this strategy is willing to contribute (when `OCR < ET`) without a significant increase in others' contributions. If the strategy contributes `PT` times in a row without the `Other Contribution Ratio` recovering sufficiently, it will give up on stimulating cooperation and permanently switch to defection.

**2. Internal State Variables (Initialized at the start of the game):**

*   `consecutive_low_ocr_contributions`: Counts consecutive rounds where this strategy contributed because the `Other Contribution Ratio (OCR)` was below `ET`. (Initialize to `0`)
*   `have_given_up_on_cooperation`: A boolean flag indicating whether this strategy has ceased attempting to stimulate cooperation due to lack of response. (Initialize to `False`)

**3. Decision Rules for Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

*   **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** Start by exploiting to maximize initial gain and observe the initial tendencies of opponents. There's no prior history to inform a cooperative decision.

*   **Round `r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. Pure self-interest dictates defecting, as there are no consequences for damaging future cooperation.

*   **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Intermediate Rounds):**

    *   **Step 3.1: Check for Prior Abandonment:**
        *   If `have_given_up_on_cooperation` is `True`:
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reasoning:** Previous attempts to stimulate cooperation were unsuccessful, indicating that opponents are either persistent defectors or unresponsive. Continued contribution would be self-sacrificing without benefit.

    *   **Step 3.2: Evaluate Previous Round's Contributions (if not given up):**
        *   Calculate the `Other Contribution Ratio (OCR)` from the *previous round (t-1)*:
            `OCR = (Number of other players who contributed in round t-1) / (n - 1)`

    *   **Step 3.3: Decide Action based on `OCR`:**
        *   **If `OCR >= ET`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reasoning:** Other players are contributing sufficiently (at or above the Exploitation Threshold). This environment is favorable for free-riding, so maximize current payoff by defecting.
            *   Reset `consecutive_low_ocr_contributions` to `0` (since contributions are now good enough that no intervention was needed, or a previous intervention was successful).

        *   **Else (`OCR < ET`):**
            *   **Step 3.3.1: Check Patience Threshold:**
                *   If `consecutive_low_ocr_contributions >= PT`:
                    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                    *   **Reasoning:** This strategy has tried to "prime the pump" for `PT` consecutive rounds, but the `OCR` has remained below the `ET`. The investment in stimulating cooperation has not paid off. Give up on attempts to foster cooperation and switch to permanent defection to avoid further losses.
                    *   Set `have_given_up_on_cooperation = True`.
                *   **Else (`consecutive_low_ocr_contributions < PT`):**
                    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                    *   **Reasoning:** The `OCR` is too low, indicating that the public good is at risk of collapsing, which would eliminate future opportunities for exploitation. This contribution is a strategic "investment" to encourage other players to contribute more in subsequent rounds, thereby maintaining a profitable pool to free-ride from.
                    *   Increment `consecutive_low_ocr_contributions` by `1`.

---

**Exploitative Alignment:**

*   **Default Defection:** The strategy always defaults to defection in the absence of strong signals to the contrary, or in end-game scenarios, directly capitalizing on the single-round dominant strategy.
*   **Conditional Contribution:** Contributions are made not out of altruism but as a calculated investment. The goal is to prevent the public good from collapsing entirely, ensuring there is still a pool of contributions from which to extract value through free-riding.
*   **Minimum Intervention:** The `Exploitation Threshold (ET)` is designed to be relatively low, meaning the strategy tolerates a significant degree of defection from others before it considers making its own costly contribution. It seeks to free-ride as much as possible.
*   **Protection Against Sucker Play:** The `Patience Threshold (PT)` ensures that the strategy does not become a persistent "sucker," continuously contributing when others fail to reciprocate. It cuts its losses and switches to permanent defection, preserving its own endowment.
*   **Adaptive and Robust:** It adapts to the observed behavior of the group, and its `PT` mechanism makes it robust against strategies that consistently defect, preventing long-term exploitation of itself.

This strategy balances opportunistic free-riding with a calculated minimal investment to maintain a cooperative environment, making it highly exploitative yet resilient.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_37 = '''
The strategy described below is an "Opportunistic Freerider" designed to maximize its own payoff by generally defecting, but with a calculated, minimal willingness to contribute if the public good is on the brink of collapse, aiming to revive it for future exploitation. It is adaptive to opponent behavior and robust across various game conditions.

---

### Strategy: The Opportunistic Freerider

This strategy prioritizes defecting to maximize immediate personal gain. However, it incorporates a mechanism to strategically "breathe life" back into the public good if it approaches a critical state of collapse, ensuring there remains a pool to exploit.

**Internal State Variables:**

*   `last_contribution_round_self`: Stores the round number when this agent last contributed. Initialize to 0.

**Parameters:**

*   `initial_defection_rounds`: A small integer (e.g., 3). Determines how many early rounds the agent will always defect.
*   `final_defection_rounds`: A small integer (e.g., 3). Determines how many late rounds the agent will always defect.
*   `collapse_threshold_ratio`: A float between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.35). Represents the minimum average contribution ratio of *other* players required for the public good to be considered viable. If the average contribution of others in the previous round falls below this, the public good is seen as collapsing.
*   `cooldown_after_contribution`: An integer (e.g., 2). After making a contribution, the agent will defect for this many rounds, regardless of the `collapse_threshold_ratio`, to prevent becoming a habitual cooperator.

**Decision Rules (in order of precedence):**

1.  **End Game Protocol:**
    *   If `current_round > r - final_defection_rounds`:
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Reason:** With too few rounds remaining to influence future behavior, there is no strategic benefit to contributing. Pure defection is optimal for maximizing immediate payoff in the game's closing stages.

2.  **Initial Defection Protocol:**
    *   Else if `current_round <= initial_defection_rounds`:
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Reason:** Establish an immediate exploitative baseline. This allows the agent to freeride on any initial contributions from other players without reciprocation, assessing the generosity of the environment.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Protocol (Intermediate Rounds):**
    *   Let `past_contributions_others = sum_{j != self} c_j^(current_round - 1)` (total contributions from all players *other than self* in the *previous* round).
    *   Calculate `cooperation_ratio_others = past_contributions_others / (n-1)`.

    *   **If (`current_round - last_contribution_round_self <= cooldown_after_contribution`):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Reason:** Enforce a strict cooling-off period after a strategic contribution. This prevents the agent from falling into a pattern of cooperation and ensures the primary objective of maximizing exploitation is maintained.

    *   **Else if (`cooperation_ratio_others < collapse_threshold_ratio`):**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   **Reason:** The public good is severely collapsing, threatening all future potential gains from it. This is a strategic, minimal "rescue contribution" designed to encourage other players to increase their contributions, after which the agent intends to resume freeriding.
        *   **Update:** Set `last_contribution_round_self = current_round`.

    *   **Else (Default Exploitation):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Reason:** The public good is sufficiently maintained by the contributions of others. The agent continues to freeride, maximizing personal payoff without expending its own tokens.

**Example Parameter Values:**

*   `initial_defection_rounds = 3`
*   `final_defection_rounds = 3`
*   `collapse_threshold_ratio = 0.35` (Meaning if, for example, less than 35% of other players contributed in the last round, consider contributing).
*   `cooldown_after_contribution = 2`

**Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:**

*   **Default Freeriding:** The strategy's default action is to Defect, consistently aiming to benefit from others' contributions without making its own.
*   **Calculated, Self-Interested Cooperation:** Any instance of cooperation is purely strategic and not altruistic. It is a minimal, calculated investment made only when the source of exploitation (the public good) is at risk of disappearing entirely, thereby preserving the opportunity for future freeriding.
*   **Strategic Cooldown:** The `cooldown_after_contribution` mechanism ensures that even after a necessary strategic contribution, the agent immediately reverts to defection, preventing any sustained cooperation and reinforcing its exploitative stance.
*   **End-Game and Initial Defection:** These phases explicitly leverage the game's temporal structure, defecting when there are no future consequences for non-cooperation or when attempting to quickly identify and exploit unconditional cooperators.

It's a calculated risk to signal potential cooperation to other players, particularly those employing adaptive or reciprocal strategies (like Tit-for-Tat). The goal is to encourage others to contribute, thereby creating an immediate opportunity for this strategy to free-ride in subsequent rounds.

**2. Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**
    *   Let `C_others_prev` be the number of *other* players (excluding this strategy itself) who contributed 1 token in the *immediately preceding* round (`t-1`).

    *   **Condition A: If `C_others_prev > 0` (i.e., at least one other player contributed in the previous round):**
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**
        *   *Rationale*: This is the core exploitative phase. If other players are contributing, the strategy maximizes its own payoff by completely free-riding on their contributions. It avoids its own cost while benefiting from the collective good generated by others. This is the greedy, profit-maximizing action when an opportunity for exploitation presents itself.

    *   **Condition B: If `C_others_prev == 0` (i.e., no other player contributed in the previous round):**
        *   **Action: Contribute (C)** with probability `p_probe`.
        *   **Action: Defect (D)** with probability `(1 - p_probe)`.
        *   *Rationale*: If all other players defected in the previous round, there is no immediate opportunity for free-riding. To prevent a prolonged state of universal defection (where this strategy's payoff is merely 1 token per round) and to seek new exploitation opportunities, the strategy occasionally "re-probes" by contributing with a small probability `p_probe`. This is a calculated risk: a single contribution might re-ignite cooperation among other adaptive strategies, creating fresh opportunities for this strategy to defect and exploit in subsequent rounds. If the probe fails to elicit cooperation, the strategy defaults back to defection, minimizing further losses.

**3. Last Round (Round r):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale*: In the final round, there are no future interactions for punishment or reward. According to the principle of backward induction, it is always individually rational to defect, as there are no consequences for free-riding. This action maximizes immediate personal gain without concern for future cooperation.

**Exploitative Alignment:**

This strategy is overtly exploitative by design. Its primary mode of operation is to free-ride on the contributions of others. It only contributes as a calculated, low-probability "investment" or "probe" – either in the first round to kickstart cooperation or later to potentially reignite it – solely for the purpose of creating opportunities to defect and maximize its own payoff at the expense of other players. It consistently prioritizes its own gain, minimizing its contributions whenever possible and exploiting any instance of others' generosity or attempts at collective welfare.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_39 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Opportunist," is designed to maximize individual payoff by defaulting to free-riding while adaptively contributing only when necessary to prevent the public good from collapsing entirely, thus preserving future opportunities for exploitation. It prioritizes self-interest and minimal contribution.

**Strategy: Adaptive Opportunist**

**Parameters:**
*   `N_others = n - 1` (number of other players)
*   `T_collapse = max(1, floor(N_others / 3))` (Threshold for "critical collapse" of the public good. If fewer than this many *other* players contributed in the previous round, the public good is considered to be struggling severely.)
*   `Defect_Streak_Required = 2` (The number of consecutive rounds I must have defected before I consider contributing when `T_collapse` is met. This ensures I don't become a regular contributor.)

**Decision Rules for Round `t` (where `t` goes from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **If `t = 1` (First Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
        *   *Rationale:* Always start by attempting to free-ride. This tests the cooperativeness of other players without incurring any cost.

2.  **If `t = r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
        *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future rounds to influence, so the dominant strategy of defection applies. Any contribution would be a pure loss relative to defecting.

3.  **If `1 < t < r` (Intermediate Rounds):**
    *   **Observe Past Round `t-1`:**
        *   `N_C_others_prev`: Count the number of players *other than myself* who contributed in round `t-1`.
        *   `my_action_prev`: Record my own action in round `t-1`.
        *   `my_action_two_prev`: Record my own action in round `t-2`. (If `t=2`, assume `my_action_two_prev` was Defect, as it effectively didn't exist, and my Round 1 action was Defect).

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **IF `N_C_others_prev < T_collapse`:**
            *   *Rationale:* This condition indicates that the public good is severely underfunded by others. My payoff will suffer significantly if this trend continues. I might need to make a minimal contribution to try and prevent total collapse.
            *   **AND IF (`my_action_prev` was Defect AND `my_action_two_prev` was Defect):**
                *   *Rationale:* I have consistently free-ridden for at least two rounds. This minimal contribution is an attempt to "re-prime the pump" or signal potential for future cooperation to others, hoping they will reciprocate and allow me to free-ride again soon. It's a strategic investment to preserve the public good for future exploitation.
                *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   **ELSE (If `N_C_others_prev < T_collapse`, BUT I contributed in one of the last two rounds):**
                *   *Rationale:* I have already made a recent contribution to support the public good. It's now up to others to step up. I won't be a constant "sucker" who consistently contributes when others are defecting.
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
        *   **ELSE (`N_C_others_prev >= T_collapse`):**
            *   *Rationale:* There is sufficient contribution from other players; the public good is healthy enough to exploit.
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**

**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**
The Adaptive Opportunist strategy primarily aims to free-ride. It only deviates from defection in intermediate rounds under specific conditions: when the public good is on the verge of collapse (threatening my own future payoffs) AND I haven't recently borne the cost of contribution myself. This minimal, conditional contribution is a calculated risk to maintain an environment conducive to future free-riding, rather than a gesture of genuine cooperation. In all other scenarios, especially the critical first and last rounds, it defects to maximize immediate gain.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_40 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to be highly exploitative in a repeated Public Goods Game. Its primary goal is to maximize its own payoff by strategically free-riding on the contributions of other players, while adapting its behavior to maintain an environment conducive to future exploitation. It is robust to various opponent behaviors and relies exclusively on game parameters and observed historical actions and payoffs.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for the public good (where `1 < k < n`).

**Internal Strategy Parameters (tuned for exploitation):**
*   `PROBE_ROUNDS = 1`: The number of initial rounds to always contribute. This serves as a minimal probe to gather initial data on opponent behavior and signal a potential willingness to cooperate.
*   `WINDOW_SIZE_FOR_HISTORY = min(max(1, floor(r / 4)), 5)`: Defines the number of most recent completed rounds to consider when calculating the average cooperation rate of other players. This parameter adapts to the total game length (`r`), with a minimum of 1 round and a cap of 5 rounds for stability.
*   `EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD = 0.7`: If the average cooperation rate from *all other players* (excluding self) in the historical window is at or above this value, the strategy will defect to free-ride.
*   `REBUILD_THRESHOLD = 0.4`: If the average cooperation rate from *all other players* in the historical window is at or below this value, the strategy will defect to protect its endowment and signal disapproval of low cooperation.
*   `LAST_ROUND_BUFFER = min(r, max(1, 3))`: The number of final rounds in the game during which the strategy will always defect, irrespective of prior history or other conditions.

**Decision Rules (for player 'i' in the current Round `t`):**

The decision rules are applied sequentially, with higher-numbered rules only being considered if the preceding rules do not apply for the current round.

---

**1. Endgame Phase (Highest Priority):**
   *   **Condition:** If the current Round `t` is from `r - LAST_ROUND_BUFFER + 1` up to `r` (inclusive).
   *   **Action:** Defect (D).
   *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds of a repeated game, there is no future interaction to incentivize continued cooperation. The individually rational, dominant strategy is to defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no long-term consequences for doing so. This ensures maximum personal gain at the very end.

---

**2. Initial Probe Phase:**
   *   **Condition:** If the current Round `t` is from 1 up to `PROBE_ROUNDS` (inclusive), and the Endgame Phase condition (Rule 1) does *not* apply.
   *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
   *   **Rationale:** This initial contribution serves as a minimal "investment" to test the waters and gather data on the cooperativeness of other players. It signals a potential for cooperation, which might encourage others to contribute, setting the stage for future exploitation.

---

**3. Adaptive Intermediate Phase (Default Behavior):**
   *   **Condition:** If neither the Endgame Phase (Rule 1) nor the Initial Probe Phase (Rule 2) conditions apply for the current Round `t`.
   *   **History Calculation:**
      *   Calculate `num_history_rounds_available = t - 1` (total rounds completed so far).
      *   Determine `effective_window_size = min(WINDOW_SIZE_FOR_HISTORY, num_history_rounds_available)`. This ensures that only available historical data is used.
      *   Retrieve the actions (`c_j`) of *all other players* (`j != i`) from these `effective_window_size` most recent completed rounds.
      *   Calculate `average_cooperation_from_others`: This is computed as the sum of all contributions made by other players (`j != i`) over these `effective_window_size` rounds, divided by `((n - 1) * effective_window_size)`.

   *   **Decision Logic (based on `average_cooperation_from_others`):**
      *   **IF `average_cooperation_from_others` >= `EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`:**
         *   **Action:** Defect (D).
         *   **Rationale:** Other players are demonstrating high levels of cooperation. This is the optimal time for exploitation: the strategy free-rides on their contributions to maximize its individual profit without significantly risking the collapse of the public good, as their high cooperation acts as a buffer.
      *   **ELSE IF `average_cooperation_from_others` <= `REBUILD_THRESHOLD`:**
         *   **Action:** Defect (D).
         *   **Rationale:** Cooperation from other players is too low. Continuing to contribute in such an environment would render this player a "sucker" and would not meaningfully improve the collective benefit. Defecting in this scenario serves to minimize losses and potentially signals to other players that increased contributions are required before this player will invest again.
      *   **ELSE (i.e., `REBUILD_THRESHOLD` < `average_cooperation_from_others` < `EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`):**
         *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
         *   **Rationale:** Cooperation is at a moderate level. In this "maintenance" zone, the player contributes. This is an strategic investment aimed at sustaining or boosting the public good, thereby encouraging others to maintain or increase their contributions. The ultimate goal is to guide the collective cooperation level back towards the `EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD` zone, where this strategy can resume its free-riding behavior.

### Strategy: The Strategic Parasite

This strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by strategically free-riding on the contributions of other players, while contributing only when necessary to prevent the collapse of the public good and ensure future free-riding opportunities. It adapts to observed cooperation levels and exploits end-game dynamics.

**Game Parameters and History Used:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `k`: Multiplier
*   `r`: Number of rounds
*   History of all players' actions (`c_j`) and payoffs (`pi_j`) from previous rounds.

**Internal Parameters (Derived from Game Parameters):**
*   `Defection_Horizon_Rounds`: The number of final rounds in which the strategy will always defect. Calculated as `max(1, floor(r / 5))`. This ensures that for shorter games, at least the last round is exploited, and for longer games, a proportionally larger tail-end is exploited.
*   `Cooperation_Trigger_Threshold`: A dynamic threshold representing the minimum average contribution rate from other players in the previous round that will cause *this* strategy to contribute. If the observed average contribution rate from others is *below* this threshold, the strategy will contribute. If it is *at or above* this threshold, the strategy will defect. This threshold is calculated as `0.5 - (k / n) * 0.2`.
    *   *Rationale:* This makes the strategy more "demanding" (i.e., more likely to defect) when `k/n` is high (stronger collective benefit makes others more likely to contribute regardless). Conversely, it's more "lenient" (i.e., more likely to contribute) when `k/n` is low (weaker collective benefit means others need more encouragement to contribute). The range is approximately 0.3 to 0.5, ensuring a reasonable balance.

**Decision Rules (Action: C for Contribute, D for Defect):**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   **Reasoning:** This initial contribution serves as a strategic probe. It signals a willingness to cooperate, which can encourage others to contribute in subsequent rounds, thereby establishing a cooperative environment for future free-riding. It also gathers initial data on opponent types. This is an investment in potential future gains.

2.  **End Game Rounds (Rounds `r - Defection_Horizon_Rounds + 1` to `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   **Reasoning:** In these final rounds, the "shadow of the future" (the potential for future interactions) is too short or non-existent to incentivize cooperation. By defecting, the strategy maximizes immediate individual payoff without risking negative repercussions in future rounds, exploiting the well-known phenomenon of end-game unraveling in repeated games.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to `r - Defection_Horizon_Rounds`):**
    *   **Information Used:** In the previous round, calculate `Num_Others_Contributed_Last_Round = sum_{j!=i} c_j_prev`.
    *   Then, calculate `Others_Contribution_Rate = Num_Others_Contributed_Last_Round / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   If `Others_Contribution_Rate < Cooperation_Trigger_Threshold`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   **Reasoning:** The observed level of collective contribution from others is too low, indicating that cooperation might be collapsing. A contribution is made to signal continued willingness to participate, attempting to "re-prime" the pump and prevent total defection, thus preserving the public good for future free-riding opportunities.
        *   Else (`Others_Contribution_Rate >= Cooperation_Trigger_Threshold`):
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**
            *   **Reasoning:** A sufficient number of contributions are being made by other players. The strategy exploits this by free-riding (keeping its token) to maximize its individual payoff, as the collective pool is healthy enough to sustain itself without immediate personal contribution.

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_42 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Free-Rider (AFR)," is designed to be highly exploitative in a repeated Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize individual payoff by defaulting to defection, but adaptively contributes when necessary to encourage or re-stimulate cooperation from other players, thereby creating opportunities for future free-riding.

**Strategy: Adaptive Free-Rider (AFR)**

**Internal State Variables:**
*   `reseed_counter`: An integer counter, initialized to 0. This tracks the number of remaining rounds I am committed to contributing as part of a "re-seeding" effort.

**Strategy Parameters (tuned for exploitative behavior):**
*   `ENDGAME_BUFFER_ROUNDS = 3`: The number of final rounds where immediate defection is absolute due to the "endgame effect."
*   `COOPERATION_REBIRTH_THRESHOLD = 0.5`: The minimum proportion of *other* players who contributed in the previous round. If the observed proportion falls below this threshold, the strategy will consider initiating a "re-seeding" effort.
*   `RESEED_DURATION = 1`: The number of consecutive rounds this player will contribute when initiating a "re-seeding" effort. A short duration is chosen to be minimal while still sending a signal.

**Decision Rules for Round `current_round` (1-indexed):**

1.  **Handle Very Short Games:**
    If the total number of rounds (`r`) is less than or equal to `ENDGAME_BUFFER_ROUNDS` (e.g., `r <= 3`):
    *   **Action:** **DEFECT (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In extremely short games, there's insufficient opportunity for repeated interaction to foster or exploit cooperation. Immediate defection is the dominant strategy for all players.

2.  **Endgame Phase:**
    Else if `current_round > r - ENDGAME_BUFFER_ROUNDS`:
    *   **Internal State Update:** Reset `reseed_counter = 0`.
    *   **Action:** **DEFECT (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** As the game approaches its conclusion, the "shadow of the future" disappears. There is no incentive for any player to contribute, as there are no subsequent rounds to reward cooperation or punish defection. Maximizing personal payoff means defecting.

3.  **Initial Probe Phase:**
    Else if `current_round == 1`:
    *   **Action:** **CONTRIBUTE (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** An initial contribution serves as a low-cost probe to signal potential cooperation. This can encourage conditional cooperators among opponents and establish a base of contributions for exploitation in later rounds. It also prevents a premature collapse of contributions if all players start by defecting.

4.  **Adaptive Mid-Game Phase (Exploitation and Re-Seeding):**
    Else (`current_round` is in the adaptive mid-game phase, meaning `current_round > 1` and `current_round <= r - ENDGAME_BUFFER_ROUNDS`):
    *   **Observation:** Calculate `proportion_other_contributions`. This is the sum of contributions from all *other* players in the *immediately preceding round* (`current_round - 1`), divided by `(n - 1)`.

    *   **Sub-Rule A: Continue Re-Seeding:**
        If `reseed_counter > 0`:
        *   **Internal State Update:** Decrement `reseed_counter` by 1.
        *   **Action:** **CONTRIBUTE (C)**.
        *   **Rationale:** Continue the short-term cooperation signal to fulfill the `RESEED_DURATION`, aiming to stimulate overall contribution levels in the group.

    *   **Sub-Rule B: Initiate Re-Seeding (Cooperation Too Low):**
        Else if `proportion_other_contributions < COOPERATION_REBIRTH_THRESHOLD`:
        *   **Internal State Update:** Set `reseed_counter = RESEED_DURATION - 1` (since the current contribution is the first in the re-seeding sequence).
        *   **Action:** **CONTRIBUTE (C)**.
        *   **Rationale:** When collective contributions from other players drop significantly, pure defection will yield minimal (potentially zero) payoffs for everyone. This action attempts to temporarily boost contributions, hoping to bring `proportion_other_contributions` back above the threshold for future exploitation. This is an investment to enable further free-riding.

    *   **Sub-Rule C: Exploit (Cooperation Sufficient):**
        Else (`proportion_other_contributions >= COOPERATION_REBIRTH_THRESHOLD` and `reseed_counter == 0`):
        *   **Action:** **DEFECT (D)**.
        *   **Rationale:** The primary exploitative action. When other players are contributing at a sufficient level, free-ride on their efforts to maximize personal gain without contributing. This is the optimal state for this strategy.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_43 = '''
Here is an exploitative strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust across various opponent behaviors.

---

**Strategy Name: The Opportunistic Forager**

This strategy aims to maximize personal payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. It is designed to be highly exploitative, only contributing a token when the collective contribution level from others falls to a critically low point, threatening the existence of a viable public good pool to exploit. This strategic contribution acts as a "lure" or "investment" to encourage renewed cooperation, after which the strategy reverts to defection.

**1. Game Parameters and History:**

*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: The multiplier for the public good.
*   `my_player_id`: Your assigned player identifier (from 0 to n-1).
*   `current_round`: The current round number (ranging from 1 to `r`).
*   `history`: A historical record of contributions from all players in previous rounds. For any round `t`, `history[t-1]` is a list containing the contributions (0 or 1) of all `n` players in that round. For example, `history[0]` contains contributions from round 1.

**2. Decision Rules for Player `my_player_id` (Yourself):**

*   **Rule for the Last Round (`current_round == r`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute 0 (Defect).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future consequences or opportunities to influence subsequent play. Pure self-interest dictates defection to maximize immediate payoff, as contributing would only incur a personal cost without any potential for future exploitation.

*   **Rule for the First Round (`current_round == 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute 0 (Defect).
    *   **Reasoning:** Begin by testing the cooperativeness of the other players without incurring any cost. This establishes an initial exploitative stance and allows the strategy to gather information on opponents' baseline behavior.

*   **Rule for Intermediate Rounds (`1 < current_round < r`):**
    *   **Step 1: Calculate Others' Total Contributions in the Previous Round.**
        Iterate through the `history` record for the round *prior* to the current one (i.e., `history[current_round - 2]`). Sum the contributions of all players *except yourself*.
        ```
        others_total_contrib_prev_round = 0
        for player_j_id from 0 to n-1:
            if player_j_id != my_player_id:
                others_total_contrib_prev_round += history[current_round - 2][player_j_id]
        ```

    *   **Step 2: Define the "Public Good Viability Threshold" (PGVT).**
        This threshold represents the minimum total contributions from other players needed for the public good to be considered "viable" or "worthwhile" to exploit. If contributions fall below this, the pool is too small for effective free-riding, and a temporary "kick-start" might be necessary.
        *   `PGVT = floor((n - 1) / 3)`
        *   (Example: If there are 4 players, `n-1=3`, so `PGVT = floor(3/3) = 1`. If there are 10 players, `n-1=9`, so `PGVT = floor(9/3) = 3`.)

    *   **Step 3: Decision Logic based on the Threshold.**
        *   **If `others_total_contrib_prev_round < PGVT`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute 1 (Cooperate).
            *   **Reasoning:** The collective contribution from others is critically low. While contributing incurs an immediate personal cost, this is a calculated, short-term "investment." It serves as a strategic signal to encourage other players to increase their contributions, thereby resuscitating the public good to a level that is profitable for future free-riding. This strategy aims to prevent the complete collapse of the common pool, ensuring there's still a resource to exploit.
        *   **Else (`others_total_contrib_prev_round >= PGVT`):**
            *   **Action:** Contribute 0 (Defect).
            *   **Reasoning:** Other players are contributing enough to maintain a sufficiently large public good. Under these conditions, the most exploitative action is to free-ride by contributing nothing, maximizing the current round's payoff by benefiting from others' contributions.

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_44 = '''
The "Opportunistic Free-Rider" strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff in the Public Goods Game by exploiting the contributions of other players while strategically intervening only when necessary to maintain an environment conducive to free-riding. It combines initial cooperation, adaptive responses to group behavior, and ultimate self-interest in the endgame.

**Strategy Name:** The Opportunistic Free-Rider

**Core Philosophy:**
The primary goal is to maximize personal utility by defecting and benefiting from the public good created by others' contributions. Contributions are made only as a calculated "investment" to prime initial cooperation, re-seed faltering cooperation, or prevent a complete breakdown of the public good that would eliminate future free-riding opportunities. When sufficient cooperation exists, the strategy always defaults to defection.

**Parameters:**
These parameters adapt based on the total number of rounds (`r`) to ensure robustness across different game lengths.

*   **`initial_cooperate_rounds`**: The number of initial rounds to always contribute. Calculated as `max(1, floor(r / 10))`. This ensures a minimum of 1 initial cooperative round, scaling up for longer games (e.g., 2 rounds for `r=20`, 5 for `r=50`, 10 for `r=100`).
*   **`endgame_defect_rounds`**: The number of final rounds to always defect. Calculated as `max(1, floor(r / 10))`. This also ensures a minimum of 1 final defection round, scaling with game length.
*   **`cooperation_reseed_threshold`**: Set to `0.3`. If the average contribution of other players falls below this value (but is not extremely low), the strategy will contribute to attempt to "re-seed" cooperation.
*   **`persistent_defection_threshold`**: Set to `0.1`. If the average contribution of other players falls below this value, the strategy assumes cooperation has completely collapsed and will always defect to minimize losses.

**Decision Rules (for round `t` from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Phase 1: Initial Warm-up (Rounds 1 to `initial_cooperate_rounds`)**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   *Rationale:* This phase is an initial investment. By contributing early, the strategy aims to signal a willingness to cooperate, encouraging other players to contribute and establish a positive environment for the public good from which it intends to free-ride later.

2.  **Phase 2: Endgame Exploitation (Rounds `r - endgame_defect_rounds + 1` to `r`)**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final rounds of the game, there are no future interactions or reputational concerns. The strategy switches to pure exploitation, defecting regardless of past behavior or current cooperation levels to maximize immediate personal payoff.

3.  **Phase 3: Adaptive Middle Game (All other rounds not covered by Phase 1 or 2)**
    *   At the start of each round in this phase, calculate `avg_others_contributions_prev_round`. This is the sum of contributions of *all other players* in round `t-1`, divided by `(n-1)`.

    *   **Sub-Rule A: Complete Breakdown Detected**
        *   If `avg_others_contributions_prev_round < persistent_defection_threshold`:
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* If the average contribution of others is extremely low, it indicates that cooperation has largely or completely collapsed. Further contributions from this strategy would be futile and only lead to being exploited. The strategy minimizes losses by defecting.

    *   **Sub-Rule B: Cooperation Faltering - Attempt to Re-seed**
        *   Else if `avg_others_contributions_prev_round < cooperation_reseed_threshold`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   *Rationale:* When cooperation is declining but not completely gone (i.e., between `persistent_defection_threshold` and `cooperation_reseed_threshold`), this strategy makes a calculated "investment." By contributing, it attempts to signal a renewed willingness to cooperate, hoping to encourage other players to increase their contributions and prevent a full collapse, thereby preserving the public good for future free-riding opportunities.

    *   **Sub-Rule C: Sufficient Cooperation - Free-Ride**
        *   Else (`avg_others_contributions_prev_round >= cooperation_reseed_threshold`):
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* When other players are contributing at a sufficient level, this is the prime opportunity for the "Opportunistic Free-Rider" to maximize its personal payoff. It defects, taking advantage of the public good created by others without incurring the cost of contribution.

**Handling Edge Cases:**
*   **`n=1`**: The problem statement `1 < k < n` implies `n >= 2`. However, if `n=1` were possible, the game becomes a simple decision of keeping 1 token or exchanging it for `k/1` benefit. Since `k/1 < 1`, keeping the token (Defect) is always the dominant strategy. The rules for `avg_others_contributions_prev_round` would not apply as `n-1=0`.
*   **First Round (`t=1`)**: Handled by Phase 1 - always Contribute (C).
*   **Last Round (`t=r`)**: Handled by Phase 2 - always Defect (D).

**Strategy Name: The Adaptive Free-Rider**

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by primarily defecting (free-riding) but adaptively contributes when necessary to encourage continued cooperation from other players, thus preserving a public good from which to benefit. It is designed to be robust against various opponent behaviors by learning from past interactions and adjusting its level of exploitation.

---

**Internal Parameters:**

*   `Defection_Ceiling (DC)`: `3` (Maximum number of consecutive rounds this player will defect before being forced to contribute to re-engage others.)
*   `Exploitation_Threshold (ET)`: `0.7` (If the average contribution rate of other players is at or above this value, the player will defect.)
*   `Reactivation_Threshold (RT)`: `0.2` (If the average contribution rate of other players drops below this value, the player considers reactivating cooperation.)
*   `Significant_Drop_Factor (SDF)`: `0.7` (If the total contributions from *all* players drops by this factor or more compared to the previous round, it indicates a significant breakdown in cooperation.)

**Internal State Variables (updated after each round `t-1`'s outcome is observed):**

*   `my_consecutive_defections`: An integer counter for consecutive rounds this player has defected. Resets to 0 when the player contributes.
*   `last_round_others_avg_contribution`: A float representing the average contribution (0 to 1) of all *other* players in the previous round `t-1`.
*   `total_contributions_history`: A list storing `sum_j c_j` (total contributions from all players) for each past round.

---

**Decision Rules:**

**1. Round 1 (t = 1):**

*   **If `r = 1` (the game is only one round long):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** There are no future rounds for retaliation or benefits from cooperation. The optimal strategy in a single-round PGG is to defect to maximize immediate payoff.
*   **If `r > 1` (the game has multiple rounds):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Initiate cooperation to probe the environment for cooperative players and encourage a baseline of contributions. This prevents an immediate race to the bottom in repeated games.

**2. Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**

*   *Before making a decision for the current round `t`, first update internal state based on the observed outcomes of the previous round `t-1`:*
    *   Calculate `last_round_others_avg_contribution = (sum_{j!=i} c_j_round_{t-1}) / (n-1)`.
    *   Add `sum_j c_j_round_{t-1}` (total contributions from all players in `t-1`) to `total_contributions_history`.

*   **Decision Logic for current round `t`:**

    *   **Scenario A: Forced Reactivation (Avoid Collapse / Reset Greed):**
        *   If `my_consecutive_defections >= DC` (e.g., this player has defected for 3 consecutive rounds)
        *   **OR** if `last_round_others_avg_contribution < RT` (e.g., less than 20% of other players contributed last round)
        *   **OR** if `t > 2` and `total_contributions_history[-1] < total_contributions_history[-2] * SDF` (e.g., total contributions dropped by 30% or more last round):
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   Reset `my_consecutive_defections = 0`.
            *   **Rationale:** This player strategically re-engages in cooperation to prevent a full collapse of the public good, which would eliminate all opportunities for future free-riding. It also serves to "reset" its perceived greed before other players give up entirely.

    *   **Scenario B: Strong Cooperation (Exploit):**
        *   Else if `last_round_others_avg_contribution >= ET` (e.g., 70% or more of other players contributed last round):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   Increment `my_consecutive_defections`.
            *   **Rationale:** Other players are demonstrating strong cooperation, making this an ideal time to free-ride and maximize individual payoff by contributing nothing while benefiting from others' generosity.

    *   **Scenario C: Moderate or Low Cooperation (Default to Exploitation):**
        *   Else (meaning `RT <= last_round_others_avg_contribution < ET` and the conditions for forced reactivation are not met):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   Increment `my_consecutive_defections`.
            *   **Rationale:** In ambiguous or moderately cooperative environments, the default is to free-ride. This strategy only deviates from defection when forced to re-engage to avoid a collapse (Scenario A) or when others' cooperation is overwhelmingly strong (Scenario B, where free-riding is clearly optimal).

**3. Last Round (t = r):**

*   **Action:** Defect (D).
*   **Rationale:** As in the single-round game, there are no future consequences for actions in the final round. Defecting maximizes immediate payoff without fear of retaliation, making it the dominant strategy.

This strategy, named "The Opportunistic Free-Rider," is designed to maximize individual payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others, while intelligently manipulating the game dynamics to encourage or restore collective contributions when they dwindle. It adapts to opponent behavior and focuses on exploitation over sustained mutual cooperation.

**Strategy Name:** The Opportunistic Free-Rider

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Internal Parameters:**
*   `INITIAL_LURE_ROUNDS`: Fixed number of initial rounds to contribute.
    *   If `r = 1`, `INITIAL_LURE_ROUNDS = 0`.
    *   If `r = 2`, `INITIAL_LURE_ROUNDS = 1`.
    *   If `r > 2`, `INITIAL_LURE_ROUNDS = 2`.
*   `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`: A floating-point value (0.0 to 1.0) representing the minimum average contribution from *other* players required to trigger a pure free-riding decision. Set to `0.5`.

**Internal State Variables (reset at the start of each game):**
*   `current_round`: Tracks the current round number (from 1 to `r`).
*   `tried_to_re_lure_last_round`: A boolean flag. `True` if this player's action in the *previous* round was a contribution made specifically to re-lure cooperation (i.e., not during the `INITIAL_LURE_ROUNDS` phase and when `Avg_Other_C` was low). `False` otherwise.

---

**Decision Rules (for each round):**

1.  **Special Case: Single Round Game (`r = 1`)**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D - contribute 0 tokens).
    *   *Rationale:* In a single-round Public Goods Game, defecting is the individually rational and dominant strategy, as there are no future interactions to consider for reciprocity or reputation.

2.  **Initial Luring Phase (`current_round <= INITIAL_LURE_ROUNDS` and `r > 1`)**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C - contribute 1 token).
    *   *Rationale:* Start by signaling a willingness to cooperate. This aims to encourage conditional cooperators among other players to contribute, establishing a pool of public good that can be exploited in later rounds. Set `tried_to_re_lure_last_round = False` at the end of this phase to ensure it's not confused with a re-lure attempt.

3.  **Endgame Phase (`current_round = r` and `r > 1`)**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D - contribute 0 tokens).
    *   *Rationale:* Due to backward induction, in the final round, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. The individually rational action is to defect, maximizing immediate payoff.

4.  **Main Exploitation & Adaptive Phase (`INITIAL_LURE_ROUNDS < current_round < r` and `r > 2`)**
    *   **Step A: Calculate Average Other Contributions (from previous round)**
        *   Retrieve the actions of all `n` players from `current_round - 1`.
        *   `Total_Contributions_Last_Round` = Sum of all `c_j` (0 or 1) from all players `j` in `current_round - 1`.
        *   `My_Contribution_Last_Round` = This player's own `c_i` in `current_round - 1`.
        *   `Avg_Other_C` = (`Total_Contributions_Last_Round` - `My_Contribution_Last_Round`) / (`n - 1`). (Assumes `n > 1`).

    *   **Step B: Decision Logic**
        *   **Condition 1: High Cooperation - Free-Ride**
            *   If `Avg_Other_C >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   `tried_to_re_lure_last_round` is set to `False`.
                *   *Rationale:* A sufficient number of other players are contributing, making it an ideal situation for free-riding. Maximize payoff by keeping the private endowment while still benefiting from others' contributions.
        *   **Condition 2: No Cooperation - Abandon Effort**
            *   If `Avg_Other_C == 0`:
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   `tried_to_re_lure_last_round` is set to `False`.
                *   *Rationale:* No one else is contributing, so there's no public good to free-ride on. Contributing would be a pure loss; defect to preserve the private endowment.
        *   **Condition 3: Moderate/Low Cooperation - Re-Lure or Give Up**
            *   If `0 < Avg_Other_C < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
                *   **Sub-condition 3a: Re-Lure Attempt Failed Last Round**
                    *   If `tried_to_re_lure_last_round` is `True`:
                        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                        *   `tried_to_re_lure_last_round` is set to `False`.
                        *   *Rationale:* This player contributed in the previous round specifically to re-lure cooperation, but `Avg_Other_C` remains below the threshold. The attempt failed, so cut losses by defecting.
                *   **Sub-condition 3b: Attempt Re-Lure**
                    *   Else (i.e., `tried_to_re_lure_last_round` is `False`):
                        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                        *   `tried_to_re_lure_last_round` is set to `True`.
                        *   *Rationale:* Other players are contributing, but not enough to meet the `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`. A single contribution is made as a temporary "investment" to signal renewed cooperation and try to stimulate others to increase their contributions, hoping to return to a free-riding state in subsequent rounds.

STRATEGY NAME: Adaptive Conditional Free-Rider

OVERVIEW:
This strategy is designed to maximize its own payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of other players. It operates from an exploitative mindset, aiming to benefit from the public good without incurring the cost, but it is also adaptive. It strategically contributes only when the overall level of cooperation falls too low, acting as a calculated 'investor' to revive the public good for future exploitation. The strategy adjusts its willingness to contribute based on the game's multiplier (k/n) to ensure the public good remains sufficiently active for profitable free-riding.

GAME PARAMETERS USED:
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `k`: Multiplier (where `1 < k < n`).
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `History`: All past actions of all players (specifically, the number of other players who contributed in the previous round).

DECISION RULES:

1.  **Dynamic Revival Threshold Calculation**:
    At the beginning of each round, a `revival_threshold` is calculated. This threshold represents the minimum proportion of *other* players who must have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to continue defecting (free-riding). If fewer than this proportion contributed, the strategy will switch to contributing itself.

    `revival_threshold = max(0.2, 0.75 * k / n)`

    *   **Rationale**:
        *   When `k/n` is high (meaning the collective benefit from contributions is relatively strong, implying a more resilient public good), the `revival_threshold` will be higher. This indicates that the strategy is more proactive in contributing to maintain cooperation levels if they start to drop. A healthier public good promises higher future free-riding gains.
        *   When `k/n` is low (meaning the collective benefit is weaker, implying a fragile public good), the `revival_threshold` will be lower. This means the strategy tolerates significantly lower levels of cooperation before it intervenes, demonstrating a more aggressive stance towards free-riding when the long-term viability of the public good is less certain.

2.  **Round-Specific Actions**:

    *   **Round 1 (First Round)**:
        *   **Action**: Contribute (C).
        *   **Reasoning**: This is an initial 'investment' or probe. Starting with a contribution attempts to "seed" cooperation among other players. If all players immediately defect in Round 1, the game can quickly devolve into perpetual defection, limiting the potential for exploitation and reducing everyone's payoff to 1 per round. By contributing once, this strategy tests the waters and aims to encourage a more cooperative environment that it can then exploit.

    *   **Intermediate Rounds (Current Round `r_current` where `1 < r_current < r`)**:
        *   **Observation**: Count the number of *other* players who contributed in the *previous* round. Let this be `prev_others_contributed_count`.
        *   **Calculate Proportion**: `prop_others_cooperated = prev_others_contributed_count / (n - 1)`.
            *   *(Note: This strategy assumes `n > 1` for a meaningful Public Goods Game. If `n=2`, then `n-1=1`, and `prop_others_cooperated` will be either 0 or 1.)*

        *   **Decision Logic**:
            *   If `prop_others_cooperated >= revival_threshold`:
                *   **Action**: Defect (D).
                *   **Reasoning**: A sufficient number of other players are contributing, indicating a healthy public good. This is an opportune moment to free-ride and maximize immediate payoff by withholding contribution while still benefiting from others' generosity.
            *   Else (`prop_others_cooperated < revival_threshold`):
                *   **Action**: Contribute (C).
                *   **Reasoning**: The level of cooperation among others has dropped too low, jeopardizing future free-riding opportunities. This strategy intervenes with a contribution to signal a willingness to cooperate, hoping to "revive" the overall contribution level among other players. This is a calculated short-term loss (spending 1 token) in anticipation of fostering a more cooperative environment, which will create more profitable free-riding opportunities in subsequent rounds.

    *   **Last Round (Current Round `r_current` == `r`)**:
        *   **Action**: Defect (D).
        *   **Reasoning**: There are no future rounds to influence or exploit. In the final round, the individually rational dominant strategy is to defect because the cost of contribution (1) always outweighs the individual benefit (`k/n`) since `k < n`.

EXPLOITATIVE MINDSET ALIGNMENT:
This strategy is fundamentally exploitative. Its primary mode of operation is to free-ride by defecting whenever others are contributing sufficiently. It only resorts to contributing as a calculated, self-serving investment: to prevent the complete collapse of cooperation, which would eliminate future opportunities for free-riding and reduce potential profits. The adaptive `revival_threshold` ensures it is strategically opportunistic, adjusting its tolerance for low cooperation based on the game's inherent payoff structure to maximize its own gains from others' contributions. It leverages others' potential willingness to maintain the public good for its own benefit.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_48 = '''
This strategy, named "The Opportunistic Free-Rider," aims to maximize individual payoff by primarily defecting and free-riding on others' contributions. It is designed to be adaptive, robust, and will only strategically contribute when contributions have severely collapsed, and there's a clear opportunity to re-ignite cooperation for future exploitation.

**Strategy Parameters:**

*   **`Exploit_Threshold`**: A proportion (e.g., 0.6). If the proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round is at or above this, the strategy will defect. This sets the bar for "enough" cooperation to free-ride.
*   **`Reignition_Threshold`**: A proportion (e.g., 0.1). If the proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round is at or below this, the strategy considers a "re-ignition" contribution. This identifies a severe collapse in cooperation.
*   **`Reignition_Cooldown_Rounds`**: An integer (e.g., `max(3, floor(r / 5))`). This is the minimum number of rounds to wait after a previous re-ignition attempt before attempting another, to prevent fruitless sacrifices.
*   **`Endgame_Window`**: An integer (e.g., `max(1, min(3, floor(r * 0.2)))`). This defines the number of final rounds where the strategy will always defect, regardless of other conditions.

**Internal State:**

*   **`last_reignition_round`**: Stores the round number when the strategy last made a re-ignition contribution. Initialized to 0 before the game starts.

---

**Decision Rules (for current_round `t`, from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Endgame Phase:**
    *   If `t > r - Endgame_Window`:
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**
        *   *Rationale:* In the final rounds, there are no future interactions to influence. Pure self-interest dictates defection to maximize immediate gain, exploiting any lingering cooperation from other players.

2.  **Initial Probe (Round 1):**
    *   If `t == 1`:
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**
        *   *Rationale:* Begin by immediately defecting to establish an exploitative stance and observe how others react. This helps gauge the baseline level of cooperation or conditional play from opponents.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation and Re-ignition (Middle Rounds):**
    *   Else (`t > 1` and not in endgame):
        *   Calculate `p_others_prev_round`: This is the proportion of other players (excluding self) who contributed in the *previous round* (`t-1`).
          `p_others_prev_round = (sum_{j != i} c_j_in_round_t-1) / (n-1)`

        *   **Condition A: Sufficient Cooperation for Exploitation:**
            *   If `p_others_prev_round >= Exploit_Threshold`:
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**
                *   *Rationale:* Other players are contributing generously enough. The strategy continues to free-ride to maximize its own payoff without incurring the cost of contribution.

        *   **Condition B: Collapsed Cooperation – Consider Re-ignition:**
            *   Else if `p_others_prev_round <= Reignition_Threshold`:
                *   If `(t - last_reignition_round) > Reignition_Cooldown_Rounds`
                    AND `(r - t) >= Reignition_Cooldown_Rounds` (ensuring enough rounds remain to benefit from potential re-ignition):
                    *   **Action: Cooperate (C)**
                    *   Set `last_reignition_round = t`
                    *   *Rationale:* Cooperation has collapsed to a critical low, potentially reducing all players' payoffs (including the exploiter's) to the baseline of 1. This is a strategic, calculated, and rare sacrifice to *attempt* to re-stimulate cooperation among conditional cooperators. The goal is to prevent a complete "race to the bottom" that benefits no one, setting up future opportunities for free-riding. This is only attempted if sufficient time has passed since a previous attempt and there are enough rounds left to potentially recoup the investment.
                *   Else (not enough cooldown or not enough rounds left):
                    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
                    *   *Rationale:* Do not waste a contribution if the conditions for successful re-ignition are not met, or if it's too late in the game for the investment to pay off.

        *   **Condition C: Moderate Cooperation – Continue Exploitation:**
            *   Else (`Reignition_Threshold < p_others_prev_round < Exploit_Threshold`):
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**
                *   *Rationale:* Contributions are moderate. The strategy continues to exploit, waiting to see if contributions rise (triggering Condition A) or fall further (triggering Condition B). The default is always to defect unless a strong reason to contribute emerges.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_49 = '''
The following strategy, "The Opportunistic Harvester," is designed to be exploitative, adaptive, and robust by leveraging the fundamental incentives of the Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize its own payoff by strategically encouraging and then exploiting cooperation from other players, while protecting its endowment when cooperation is low.

---

**Strategy Name:** The Opportunistic Harvester

**Core Philosophy:**
The strategy is designed to "seed" cooperation to create an environment ripe for exploitation. Once cooperation is established, it will repeatedly defect to maximize individual gain. If cooperation falters due to its own exploitation or others' defection, it will make a strategic "re-investment" by contributing, in an attempt to re-establish a cooperative environment for future exploitation.

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n).
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   **`CooperationThreshold (TH)`:** A dynamic threshold representing the minimum number of *other* players (excluding self) whose contributions in the previous round are considered "sufficiently cooperative" to either trigger exploitation or to justify continued investment.
    *   *Calculation:* `TH = ceil((n - 1) * 0.6)`
    *   (e.g., if n=5, n-1=4. TH = ceil(4 * 0.6) = ceil(2.4) = 3. This means if 3 out of 4 other players contributed, it's sufficient.)
*   **`ExploitationLimit (EL)`:** The maximum number of consecutive rounds this player will defect *while others are meeting the `CooperationThreshold`*, before making a re-investment (contributing) to prevent the collapse of cooperation.
    *   *Recommended Value:* `EL = 2` (Allows for two rounds of exploitation before a strategic re-contribution).

**Internal State (Player i's own memory):**
*   `my_consecutive_defections_in_cooperative_env`: An integer counter. This tracks how many consecutive rounds Player i has defected *specifically when other players met or exceeded `TH`*. This counter is reset to 0 whenever Player i contributes (C).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round `r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action: DEFECT (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. The dominant strategy is to defect to maximize immediate personal gain, regardless of others' actions or prior history.

2.  **Round 1:**
    *   **Action: CONTRIBUTE (C).**
    *   *Rationale:* This is a calculated "initial investment" to signal potential cooperation and encourage other players to contribute. By initiating cooperation, the strategy aims to establish a cooperative environment that can be exploited in subsequent rounds.
    *   *Initialization:* Reset `my_consecutive_defections_in_cooperative_env = 0`.

3.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Exploitation Phase):**
    *   First, determine `prev_non_me_contributors`: This is the sum of contributions from all *other* players in the *immediately preceding* round (Round `current_round - 1`).

    *   **Scenario A: Others are sufficiently cooperative (`prev_non_me_contributors >= TH`)**
        *   *Rationale:* The environment is cooperative enough to be exploited.
        *   **If `my_consecutive_defections_in_cooperative_env < EL`:**
            *   **Action: DEFECT (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* Exploit the current cooperation to maximize personal payoff. Increment `my_consecutive_defections_in_cooperative_env`.
        *   **Else (`my_consecutive_defections_in_cooperative_env >= EL`):**
            *   **Action: CONTRIBUTE (C).**
            *   *Rationale:* The strategy has reached its `ExploitationLimit`. To prevent the collapse of cooperation (and thus the loss of future exploitation opportunities), the strategy makes a strategic re-investment. This resets the "mood" and encourages others to continue cooperating. Reset `my_consecutive_defections_in_cooperative_env = 0`.

    *   **Scenario B: Others are *not* sufficiently cooperative (`prev_non_me_contributors < TH`)**
        *   *Rationale:* The environment is not cooperative enough to justify contributing, or it has broken down. Continuing to contribute would be costly with minimal benefit.
        *   **Action: DEFECT (D).**
        *   *Rationale:* Protect personal endowment. There is little or no collective benefit to harvest, and contributing would make this player a "sucker." This also serves as a "punishment" for non-cooperation. Reset `my_consecutive_defections_in_cooperative_env = 0` (as no active exploitation is occurring).

This strategy, named "The Adaptive Opportunist," is designed to maximize its individual payoff in the Public Goods Game by predominantly free-riding on the contributions of other players. It adopts an exploitative mindset, strategically contributing only when necessary to prevent a complete collapse of cooperation that it could otherwise exploit, and always prioritizing self-interest, especially in the game's final stages.

**Internal State (persists across rounds):**

*   **`observed_cooperation_rate`**: A floating-point value (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0) representing a weighted moving average of the proportion of *other* players who contributed in previous rounds. This acts as the strategy's assessment of how cooperative the group currently is. It is initialized to 0.0 before Round 1.
*   **`learning_rate (alpha)`**: Set to `0.7`. This parameter dictates how quickly the strategy's `observed_cooperation_rate` adapts to the most recent round's cooperation (a higher `alpha` means older history has more weight).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (`r_current == 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** This initial defection serves multiple purposes: it immediately maximizes personal gain without committing any tokens, it tests the group's initial willingness to cooperate (identifying potential "suckers"), and establishes a baseline for future observations.

2.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (`1 < r_current < r`):**
    *   **Update `observed_cooperation_rate`:**
        *   Let `S_others_last_round` be the total number of tokens contributed by all *other* players in the previous round (`r_current - 1`).
        *   Calculate `current_others_cooperation_ratio = S_others_last_round / (n - 1)`. (This assumes `n >= 2`, as `n=1` would make the concept of "others" and a public good game moot).
        *   Update the `observed_cooperation_rate` using the weighted average formula:
            `observed_cooperation_rate = (alpha * observed_cooperation_rate) + ((1 - alpha) * current_others_cooperation_ratio)`.
    *   **Decision based on `observed_cooperation_rate`:**
        *   **If `observed_cooperation_rate >= 0.5` (Strong Group Cooperation):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
            *   **Rationale:** When the group is highly cooperative, the strategy's optimal move is to free-ride, extracting maximum benefit from the public good without incurring any cost.
        *   **Else if `observed_cooperation_rate >= 0.2` (Moderate Group Cooperation):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
            *   **Rationale:** Even with moderate cooperation, there is still enough public good being generated to benefit from free-riding. This continues to exploit the situation while signaling a consistent, self-interested stance.
        *   **Else (`observed_cooperation_rate < 0.2`, Low or Collapsed Group Cooperation):**
            *   Let `S_total_last_round` be the sum of all contributions (including mine) in the previous round (`r_current - 1`).
            *   **If `S_total_last_round == 0` (Universal Defection by all players):**
                *   **Action:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
                *   **Rationale:** If no one (including this strategy) contributed in the last round, the public good has completely collapsed. Contributing now would be a pure loss, as there's no pool to exploit. Continued defection is the rational response.
            *   **Else (`S_total_last_round > 0`, some cooperation still exists):**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (1 token) with a **20% probability**.
                *   **Action:** Defect (0 tokens) with an **80% probability**.
                *   **Rationale:** When cooperation is very low but not entirely absent, there's a small, calculated risk to "re-seed" or "stimulate" the public good. An infrequent contribution might encourage other conditional cooperators to re-engage, thereby creating a larger pool for this strategy to exploit in subsequent rounds. The low probability minimizes personal cost for this speculative, self-serving action.

3.  **Final Round (`r_current == r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** In the very last round, there are no future interactions for reciprocity, punishment, or further exploitation. The individually rational choice is to defect to maximize the final payoff, ensuring the strategy avoids being a "sucker" to other endgame defectors.

**Exploitative Alignment:**

"The Adaptive Opportunist" is inherently exploitative. It aggressively pursues free-riding whenever others contribute, using adaptive thresholds to determine when exploitation is most profitable. Its rare contributions are not altruistic but calculated "pokes" aimed at reigniting cooperation for future self-benefit. By consistently defecting when possible and always defecting in the endgame, it maximizes its personal gain with minimal concern for collective welfare, making it robust against various opponent behaviors while maintaining its exploitative edge.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_51 = '''
This strategy, named "Opportunistic Prowler," is designed to be highly exploitative in the Public Goods Game. Its core principle is to free-ride on others' contributions as much as possible, only investing in the public good temporarily and strategically when collective contributions drop too low to sustain profitable free-riding. It leverages the adaptive nature of opponents while maintaining a strong self-interest bias.

**Strategy: Opportunistic Prowler**

**Internal Parameters and State:**

*   **`N_PROBE = 2`**: The number of initial rounds to always defect, probing for the cooperativeness of the group.
*   **`N_ENDGAME = max(2, ceil(r * 0.1))`**: The number of final rounds to always defect, representing the "endgame" phase. This ensures that even in short games, there's a definite defection phase, but it also scales with longer games (e.g., 10% of rounds, minimum 2).
*   **`FREE_RIDE_THRESHOLD = 0.4`**: A critical threshold. If the average contribution of other players falls below this value in the previous round, the strategy considers the public good to be at risk of collapse and may trigger re-stimulation.
*   **`STIMULATE_DURATION = 1`**: The number of rounds to contribute if the strategy decides to "re-stimulate" the group. This is kept short to minimize personal cost.
*   **`Stimulating_Counter`**: An internal counter, initialized to 0. It tracks how many rounds the strategy is committed to contributing as part of a re-stimulation effort.

**Decision Rules (by Round Phase):**

1.  **Initial Probe Phase (Rounds `t = 1` to `N_PROBE`)**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D - contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy immediately tests the waters by defecting. This serves two purposes: identifying "sucker" strategies that contribute regardless and establishing a strong self-interested stance from the outset.

2.  **Endgame Defection Phase (Rounds `t = r - N_ENDGAME + 1` to `r`)**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D - contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** Based on backward induction, there's no future benefit to be gained from cooperation in the final rounds. Maximizing immediate payoff through defection is the dominant strategy.

3.  **Adaptive Middle Game Phase (All other rounds not covered by phases 1 or 2)**
    *   **Calculate `Average_Other_Contribution` (AOC):**
        *   `AOC = (sum of contributions of all *other* players in the previous round) / (n - 1)`
        *   (For round `t`, this calculation uses data from round `t-1`).

    *   **Current State Check:**
        *   **If `Stimulating_Counter > 0`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C - contribute 1 token).
            *   Decrement `Stimulating_Counter`.
            *   **Rationale:** The strategy is currently fulfilling a pre-committed "re-stimulation" effort. It must complete this temporary cooperation before re-evaluating.

        *   **Else (`Stimulating_Counter` is 0 - not currently stimulating):**
            *   **Condition for Triggering Stimulation:** If `AOC < FREE_RIDE_THRESHOLD`.
            *   **If condition met:**
                *   **Action:** Set `Stimulating_Counter = STIMULATE_DURATION`.
                *   **Action for current round:** Contribute (C - contribute 1 token).
                *   **Rationale:** The collective contribution has dropped too low to sustain profitable free-riding. This is a calculated, temporary investment. By contributing minimally, the strategy attempts to "reset" the group's behavior, demonstrating that cooperation can yield benefits and encouraging other players (especially reciprocal ones) to contribute again, thereby creating future free-riding opportunities for the Opportunistic Prowler.
            *   **Else (AOC is sufficient for free-riding):**
                *   **Action:** Defect (D - contribute 0 tokens).
                *   **Rationale:** Others are contributing enough. The strategy continues to maximize immediate payoff by free-riding on their contributions without expending its own resources.

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Default Defection:** The strategy's default and preferred action is to defect, minimizing personal cost.
*   **Strategic Cooperation:** Cooperation is never an end in itself but a means to an end. It's a calculated, short-term investment to revive the public good *just enough* for the strategy to resume its free-riding behavior.
*   **Adaptive Free-Riding:** The strategy constantly monitors the group's behavior and adapts to ensure it benefits from others' contributions whenever possible. It's quick to resume free-riding after any temporary cooperative stint.
*   **No Altruism:** There is no intrinsic motivation to foster collective welfare beyond what directly or indirectly benefits the Opportunistic Prowler's payoff.

Strategy Name: Calculated Lure

Description:
This strategy is designed to maximize its own payoff in the Public Goods Game by primarily free-riding on the contributions of other players. It operates on an exploitative principle, only engaging in temporary cooperation (a "lure") when the overall level of contributions from others drops so low that it threatens future free-riding opportunities, and there are sufficient rounds remaining for such a temporary gesture to potentially stimulate renewed cooperation from the group.

Game Parameters:
- `n`: total number of players in the game.
- `r`: total number of rounds in the game.
- `k`: the multiplier applied to total contributions, where `1 < k < n`.

Internal Strategy Parameters (these values are set by this AI system for its own behavior):
- `CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`: A float between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.33). This represents the minimum acceptable proportion of *other* players who contributed in the previous round. If `cooperation_ratio_others` falls below this threshold, the strategy considers executing a 'lure'.
- `MIN_REMAINING_ROUNDS_FOR_LURE`: An integer (e.g., 5). This is the minimum number of rounds that must remain in the game for a 'lure' attempt to be considered viable. If `(r - current_round)` is less than or equal to this value, no further lures will be attempted.

Strategy State Variable (per game instance, tracks this player's own past action):
- `my_action_in_prev_round_was_contribute`: A boolean, initialized to `False` at the very beginning of the game. This tracks whether *this specific player* contributed in the immediately preceding round.

Decision Rule for Round `current_round` (from 1 to `r`):

1.  **If `current_round == 1` (First Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (c_i = 0).
    *   **Reasoning:** Establish a baseline of non-cooperation. This tests the initial willingness of other players to cooperate without any cost to this player, setting an immediate exploitative stance.

2.  **If `current_round == r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (c_i = 0).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future consequences for current actions. Therefore, defection is the dominant strategy, guaranteeing the `(1 - c_i)` component of the payoff without any risk of influencing future cooperation.

3.  **If `1 < current_round < r` (Middle Rounds):**

    *   **Step 3a: Check if this player just executed a 'Lure' contribution:**
        *   If `my_action_in_prev_round_was_contribute` is `True`:
            *   **Action:** Defect (c_i = 0).
            *   **Reasoning:** The purpose of the previous round's temporary contribution was to encourage others. Having made the sacrifice, the strategy immediately reverts to free-riding, expecting others to have been influenced. This minimizes personal cost and maximizes exploitation of any renewed cooperation.

    *   **Step 3b: Otherwise (this player defected in the previous round, or it was Round 1):**
        *   **Observe History:** Retrieve the actions of all players from `current_round - 1`.
        *   **Calculate Others' Cooperation:** Count `num_other_cooperators_in_prev_round`, which is the number of players *other than this player* who contributed in `current_round - 1`.
        *   **Determine Cooperation Ratio:** Calculate `cooperation_ratio_others = num_other_cooperators_in_prev_round / (n - 1)`.

        *   **Conditions for a new 'Lure' attempt:**
            *   `cooperation_ratio_others < CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD` (meaning cooperation from others is critically low, threatening future free-riding benefits).
            *   **AND** `(r - current_round) > MIN_REMAINING_ROUNDS_FOR_LURE` (meaning there are enough rounds left in the game for a temporary contribution to potentially have a positive, exploitable effect on others' future contributions).

        *   **If 'Lure' conditions are met:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (c_i = 1).
            *   **Reasoning:** This is a calculated risk. Cooperation is too low to extract significant benefits from the common pool. A single, temporary contribution is an attempt to "kick-start" or encourage other players to contribute more in subsequent rounds, which this strategy can then free-ride upon.

        *   **If 'Lure' conditions are NOT met:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (c_i = 0).
            *   **Reasoning:** Either there is sufficient cooperation from others to free-ride effectively without contributing, or cooperation has collapsed too severely/too late in the game for a single contribution to make a difference and warrant the cost.

**Post-Decision Update (for the next round's logic):**
After this strategy has chosen its action (`c_i`) for `current_round`, it updates its internal state variable:
- Set `my_action_in_prev_round_was_contribute` to `True` if `c_i` was 1 (Contribute); otherwise, set it to `False` if `c_i` was 0 (Defect).

This strategy, named "Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to maximize individual payoff by exploiting the contributions of other players, while being adaptive enough to prevent a total collapse of the public good that would eliminate free-riding opportunities. It relies solely on observed past actions and game parameters.

---

**Adaptive Free-Rider Strategy Description**

The strategy operates in three distinct phases: an initial testing phase, an adaptive exploitative phase, and a final exploitation phase.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `k`: Multiplier for the public good (1 < k < n)
*   `r`: Total number of rounds

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Initial Phase (Round 1):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the first round, the strategy starts by defecting. This serves two purposes: (1) It immediately maximizes the player's payoff if any other players choose to contribute (pure free-riding). (2) It acts as a low-risk test to observe if any opponents are predisposed to cooperation without incurring any cost.

2.  **Intermediate Phase (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
    *   In each intermediate round `t`, the strategy reviews the actions of all other players from the immediately preceding round `t-1`.
    *   **Information Gathering:**
        *   Let `N_others_contributed_prev_round` be the count of players (excluding oneself) who contributed 1 token (Action C) in round `t-1`.
    *   **Calculate Revitalization Threshold:**
        *   Define `T = floor(n / k)`. This threshold represents the approximate minimum number of total contributions needed for the public good to return at least 1 token per player (breaking even on an individual contribution). Since `1 < k < n`, `n/k` is always greater than 1, ensuring `T` is at least 1.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `N_others_contributed_prev_round < T`:**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)** in the current round.
            *   **Rationale:** If the collective contributions from other players have fallen below the `T` threshold, it signals that the public good is severely underperforming, meaning free-riding opportunities are diminishing. By contributing one's own token, the strategy makes a minimal "investment" to attempt to "re-prime" cooperation among others. This action is not for altruism, but to prevent a complete collapse of the public good that would lead to all players defecting and yielding a low, fixed payoff (1 per round).
        *   **Else (`N_others_contributed_prev_round >= T`):**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** in the current round.
            *   **Rationale:** If other players are contributing sufficiently (above or at the `T` threshold), the public good is robust enough for the strategy to continue free-riding. This maximizes the player's individual payoff by receiving benefits from others' contributions without incurring the cost of contributing.

3.  **Final Phase (Round r):**
    *   **Action:** Always **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of the game, there are no future interactions to consider or influence. Therefore, the dominant strategy of defecting (keeping the private endowment) applies, as there is no incentive for conditional cooperation or reciprocity. This ensures maximum payoff for the last round.

---
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_54 = '''
Here's an exploitative strategy designed for the Public Goods Game, emphasizing adaptation and robustness against various opponent behaviors.

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Free-Rider with Strategic Prodding

**Core Principle:** Maximize personal payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. This strategy employs limited, strategic cooperation only when necessary to stimulate or sustain a public goods pool that can then be exploited. It always reverts to defection for maximum benefit and exploits the endgame by defecting unconditionally.

**Game Parameters (Provided):**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (where 1 < k < n)

**Strategy Parameters (Internal, Tunable Values):**
*   `InitialCooperationRounds = 2`: The number of rounds at the very beginning of the game where the strategy will cooperate. This is a strategic "bait" to encourage initial cooperation from others.
*   `ExploitationThresholdLow = 0.25`: A decimal representing the minimum average contribution rate (between 0 and 1) of *other players* in the previous round. If the average drops below this threshold, it indicates a dangerously low public goods pool, triggering a potential "prodding" cooperation attempt.
*   `ProddingCooldownRounds = 5`: The minimum number of rounds that must pass since the last "prodding" cooperation attempt before another one can be initiated. This prevents the strategy from becoming a perpetual "sucker" if prodding efforts are consistently unsuccessful.
*   `FinalDefectionRounds = 2`: The number of final rounds in the game during which this strategy will always defect, regardless of history or current contributions.

**Internal State (Used for tracking history):**
*   `LastProddingRound`: An integer storing the round number when the last "prodding" cooperation occurred. Initialized to `0` at the start of the game.

---

**Decision Rules for Current Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Endgame Exploitation Phase:**
    *   **Condition:** If `t > r - FinalDefectionRounds`.
    *   **Action:** **Defect (Contribute 0 tokens)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds, there's no opportunity for future interactions to incentivize cooperation. Rational players will defect to maximize their immediate payoff. This strategy follows suit to secure maximum gain at the very end.

2.  **Initial Cooperation Phase:**
    *   **Condition:** Else if `t <= InitialCooperationRounds`.
    *   **Action:** **Cooperate (Contribute 1 token)**.
        *   If `t == InitialCooperationRounds`, update `LastProddingRound = t`.
    *   **Rationale:** This initial cooperation acts as a strategic "bait." By contributing early, the strategy aims to signal a willingness to cooperate and encourage other players to contribute. The goal is to establish a cooperative environment and create a public goods pool that can then be exploited in subsequent rounds. This is a calculated short-term investment for potential long-term free-riding.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (After Initial Cooperation, Before Endgame):**
    *   **Condition:** Else (i.e., `t > InitialCooperationRounds` and `t <= r - FinalDefectionRounds`).
    *   **Information Retrieval:**
        *   Let `SumOtherContributions_Prev` be the sum of contributions from all *other* `(n-1)` players in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`).
        *   Let `AverageOtherContributions_Prev = SumOtherContributions_Prev / (n-1)`.

    *   **Default Action:**
        *   The default action is to **Defect (Contribute 0 tokens)**. This is the primary stance, allowing the strategy to free-ride on any existing contributions.

    *   **Conditional "Prodding" (Overrides Default Defect if conditions met):**
        *   **Condition:** If `AverageOtherContributions_Prev < ExploitationThresholdLow` (the collective pool of contributions from others is too low to effectively exploit)
            **AND** `t - LastProddingRound > ProddingCooldownRounds` (enough time has passed since the last "prodding" attempt, preventing excessive self-sacrifice)
            **AND** `t <= r - FinalDefectionRounds - 1` (there is at least one round *after* this potential "prodding" round and *before* the final defection phase to benefit from any renewed cooperation from others).
        *   **Action (if conditions met):** **Cooperate (Contribute 1 token)**.
            *   Update `LastProddingRound = t`.
        *   **Rationale:** If the public goods pool shrinks too much, there's little left to exploit. This "prodding" mechanism is a calculated risk: a temporary cooperation to try and "re-ignite" collective contributions from others. The strategy hopes that this single contribution will encourage other players to increase their contributions, thereby rebuilding a larger public good pool that this strategy can then revert to free-riding on. If these conditions are not met, the strategy sticks to its default of defecting.

---
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_55 = '''
Here is an exploitative strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Free-Rider with Strategic Lure

**Parameters:**
*   **`T_floor`**: A floating-point number between 0 and 1 (recommended starting value: 0.4). This threshold defines the minimum proportion of other players who *must* have contributed in the previous round for this strategy to feel confident enough to defect. If the observed proportion of cooperators falls below `T_floor`, the strategy considers contributing to prevent a collapse.
*   **`PatienceRounds`**: An integer (recommended starting value: 2). This specifies the maximum number of consecutive rounds this strategy will contribute when it is attempting to "re-seed" or encourage cooperation after observing low contribution levels, before giving up on that attempt.

**Internal State (resets for each new game):**
*   **`consecutive_low_coop_contributions`**: An integer, initialized to 0 at the start of each game. This counter tracks how many consecutive rounds this strategy has contributed specifically because `P_C_others_prev` was below `T_floor`.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (`current_round == 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This initial contribution acts as an investment to "lure" other players into a cooperative mode. By signaling a willingness to contribute, the strategy aims to encourage others to contribute, thereby creating a pool of public goods that can be exploited in subsequent rounds.
    *   **Update State:** Set `consecutive_low_coop_contributions = 0`.

2.  **Last Round (`current_round == r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. The rational and exploitative choice is to defect, maximizing the immediate payoff without concern for future consequences or maintaining cooperation.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < current_round < r`):**
    *   **Observation:**
        *   Count `N_C_others_prev`: The total number of contributions made by *all other players* in the immediately preceding round (`current_round - 1`).
        *   Calculate `P_C_others_prev`: The proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round, i.e., `N_C_others_prev / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `P_C_others_prev >= T_floor`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** A sufficient number of other players are contributing, creating a valuable public good. The strategy capitalizes on this by free-riding on their contributions, maximizing its own current-round payoff without risking a breakdown of collective cooperation.
            *   **Update State:** Reset `consecutive_low_coop_contributions = 0`.

        *   **Else (`P_C_others_prev < T_floor`):**
            *   **Rationale:** The level of cooperation among other players has fallen below the acceptable `T_floor`. This situation risks a complete collapse of collective contributions, which would eliminate shared benefits for everyone, including this strategy. The strategy must decide whether to attempt to revive cooperation.
            *   **If `consecutive_low_coop_contributions < PatienceRounds`:**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** This is a calculated, strategic investment. The strategy contributes for a limited number of rounds (`PatienceRounds`) to attempt to "re-seed" or encourage other players to increase their contributions. The goal is to restore a level of collective cooperation that can again be profitably exploited.
                *   **Update State:** Increment `consecutive_low_coop_contributions` by 1.
            *   **Else (`consecutive_low_coop_contributions >= PatienceRounds`):**
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** The strategy has made its allotted `PatienceRounds` attempts to encourage cooperation, but other players have not responded by increasing their contributions. Continuing to contribute under these circumstances would be "sucker behavior" and detrimental to an exploitative goal. At this point, the strategy cuts its losses and defects, even if it means minimal shared benefits, rather than being continuously exploited.
                *   **Update State:** Reset `consecutive_low_coop_contributions = 0`. (This reset allows for a renewed attempt to re-seed cooperation in the future, should the observed `P_C_others_prev` somehow recover and then drop again.)

---

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Initial Lure:** The first-round contribution is a calculated risk to "seed" cooperation, establishing a public good that can be exploited.
*   **Conditional Free-Riding:** The default action in intermediate rounds is to defect whenever others are contributing sufficiently (`P_C_others_prev >= T_floor`), maximizing individual gain.
*   **Strategic Maintenance:** Contributions are only made when the collective good is critically low (`P_C_others_prev < T_floor`), not out of altruism, but as a necessary, limited investment to prevent a total collapse of the system from which this strategy benefits.
*   **Sucker-Punishment:** The `PatienceRounds` mechanism prevents continuous exploitation by unresponsive opponents, ensuring the strategy doesn't become a perpetual contributor without adequate returns.
*   **End-Game Defection:** The final round is ruthlessly exploited by defecting, securing immediate maximum gain without concern for future interactions.

The "Adaptive Predator" strategy is designed to maximize individual payoff in the repeated Public Goods Game by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others, while maintaining the ability to strategically "stimulate" cooperation if the collective good is at risk of collapsing entirely. It is adaptive, robust, and explicitly exploitative.

---

**Strategy Name: The Adaptive Predator**

This strategy operates in distinct phases, leveraging observed behavior to exploit cooperative tendencies and prevent the game from stagnating into a low-payoff state for all.

**Game Parameters (Provided):**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for the common pool (1 < k < n).

**Strategy-Specific Parameters (Tunable):**
*   `Exploitation_Threshold_Ratio`: (Default: `0.6`) The proportion of *other* players whose contributions in the previous round are considered "high enough" to trigger immediate defection. (e.g., `round((n-1) * 0.6)` contributions needed).
*   `Stimulus_Threshold_Ratio`: (Default: `0.2`) The proportion of *other* players whose contributions in the previous round are considered "too low." (e.g., `round((n-1) * 0.2)` contributions needed or fewer).
*   `Stimulus_Consecutive_Low_Rounds`: (Default: `3`) The number of consecutive rounds where contributions have been "too low" to trigger a single "stimulus" cooperation.
*   `Endgame_Rounds`: (Default: `max(2, min(5, round(r * 0.2)))`) The number of final rounds during which the strategy always defects, regardless of prior play. This ensures optimal play when future interactions are not a concern.

**Internal State:**
*   `Stimulus_Low_Count`: An integer counter, initialized to 0 at the start of the game. It tracks the number of consecutive rounds where other players' contributions have fallen below the `Stimulus_Threshold_Ratio`.

---

**Decision Rules (Per Round `t`, from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Endgame Phase Detection:**
    *   **IF** the current round `t` is greater than `r - Endgame_Rounds`:
        *   **ACTION: Defect (Contribute 0 tokens).**
        *   *Rationale:* In the final rounds, there is no opportunity to influence future play, making individual defection the most rational choice to maximize immediate payoff.

2.  **Initial Round (First Impression):**
    *   **ELSE IF** `t == 1` (the very first round of the game):
        *   **ACTION: Defect (Contribute 0 tokens).**
        *   *Rationale:* Start by maximizing individual gain and observing the initial cooperativeness of others without taking any personal risk. This immediately exploits any naive cooperators.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (Mid-Game):**
    *   **ELSE** (for all other rounds `t`):
        *   **Observe:** Review the actions (`c_j_{t-1}`) of all *other* players (`j != i`) from the previous round `t-1`.
        *   **Calculate:** `num_others_contributed = sum_{j!=i} c_j_{t-1}` (the total number of tokens contributed by other players in the previous round).

        *   **Condition A: High Cooperation Detected (Exploitation Opportunity):**
            *   **IF** `num_others_contributed >= round((n-1) * Exploitation_Threshold_Ratio)`:
                *   **ACTION: Defect (Contribute 0 tokens).**
                *   *Rationale:* A sufficient number of others are contributing, creating a favorable environment for free-riding. Capitalize on their cooperation to maximize personal payoff. Reset `Stimulus_Low_Count` to 0.

        *   **Condition B: Critically Low Cooperation Detected (Potential System Collapse / Need for Stimulus):**
            *   **ELSE IF** `num_others_contributed <= round((n-1) * Stimulus_Threshold_Ratio)`:
                *   Increment `Stimulus_Low_Count` by 1.
                *   **IF** `Stimulus_Low_Count >= Stimulus_Consecutive_Low_Rounds`:
                    *   **ACTION: Cooperate (Contribute 1 token) for this round.**
                    *   Reset `Stimulus_Low_Count` to 0.
                    *   *Rationale:* If cooperation among others has been consistently very low for several rounds, the public good is likely collapsing, leading to very low payoffs for everyone (including us, receiving only the kept token). A temporary "stimulus" contribution is a calculated risk to encourage conditional cooperators to re-engage, potentially re-establishing future free-riding opportunities.
                *   **ELSE** (contributions are low, but not yet critically or consistently low):
                    *   **ACTION: Defect (Contribute 0 tokens).**
                    *   *Rationale:* Do not become a sucker if contributions are low but haven't reached the critical point for intervention.

        *   **Condition C: Moderate Cooperation (Default Exploitation):**
            *   **ELSE** (if neither Condition A nor Condition B is met, i.e., `Stimulus_Threshold_Ratio < num_others_contributed < Exploitation_Threshold_Ratio`):
                *   **ACTION: Defect (Contribute 0 tokens).**
                *   Reset `Stimulus_Low_Count` to 0.
                *   *Rationale:* The default exploitative action is to defect. Only deviate from this if there's a strong strategic reason (high cooperation to exploit, or critically low cooperation requiring a stimulus).

---

**Summary of Exploitative Alignment:**

The "Adaptive Predator" embodies an exploitative mindset by:
1.  **Prioritizing Defection:** Its default action is to defect, maximizing personal gain at others' expense whenever possible.
2.  **Free-Riding:** It actively defects when others are contributing, extracting value from their cooperation without reciprocating.
3.  **Strategic "Bait":** The rare cooperative action (the "stimulus") is not altruistic but a calculated, short-term investment to prevent the total collapse of the public good, which would ultimately diminish its own potential for exploitation in future rounds. It's a reset mechanism to create new opportunities for free-riding.
4.  **Endgame Ruthlessness:** It fully defects in the final rounds, taking advantage of the lack of future repercussions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_57 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Free-Rider," aims to maximize its own payoff by strategically free-riding on others' contributions while adapting to maintain a sufficient level of collective cooperation for exploitation. It balances initial signaling, aggressive defection, and re-engagement when cooperation wanes, with a clear endgame exploitation.

**Strategy: The Adaptive Free-Rider**

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**History Available:**
*   All players' past actions (`c_j`) and payoffs (`pi_j`) for rounds `1` to `t-1`.

**Decision Rules (for current round `t`):**

1.  **Calculate Phase Boundaries:**
    *   `initial_lure_rounds_count`: `max(1, min(2, floor(r / 5)))`
        *   This defines a short initial period (1 or 2 rounds, or up to 20% of total rounds for longer games) to establish a baseline.
    *   `endgame_defect_rounds_count`: `max(1, min(3, floor(r / 4)))`
        *   This defines the final period (1 to 3 rounds, or up to 25% of total rounds for longer games) for maximum exploitation.

2.  **Determine Action for Round `t`:**

    *   **a. Immediate Defection for Single Round Games (Edge Case: `r = 1`):**
        *   **If `r = 1`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** In a single-round Public Goods Game, defecting is the dominant strategy regardless of opponent behavior. There is no future to influence or collective pool to exploit, so maximizing immediate personal gain requires keeping the token.

    *   **b. Endgame Defection Phase (Prioritized for `t` > `r - endgame_defect_rounds_count`):**
        *   **Else if `t > r - endgame_defect_rounds_count`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** As the game approaches its end, there are no future rounds in which to influence player behavior or benefit from continued cooperation. Backward induction dictates that players will defect. This strategy maximizes the final payoff by free-riding on any remaining cooperators.

    *   **c. Initial Lure Phase (For `t` <= `initial_lure_rounds_count`):**
        *   **Else if `t <= initial_lure_rounds_count`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** This initial cooperation serves as a strategic investment. It attempts to signal a willingness to cooperate and encourage other players to contribute, thereby establishing a shared pool that can be exploited in subsequent rounds. This phase is skipped if `r = 1` due to the previous rule.

    *   **d. Adaptive Exploitation Phase (All other rounds):**
        *   **Else (i.e., `initial_lure_rounds_count < t <= r - endgame_defect_rounds_count`):**
            *   Retrieve `c_others_prev`, the number of other players (`n-1`) who contributed in the *previous* round (`t-1`).
            *   Let `n_others = n - 1`.
            *   **Decision:**
                *   **If `c_others_prev < floor(n_others / 2)` (Cooperation is low):**
                    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                    *   **Rationale:** If the number of other cooperators falls below a critical threshold (less than half), it indicates a breakdown in collective contribution. Contributing here acts as a "re-lure" or "re-priming" mechanism, aiming to encourage other players to resume cooperation, thus reconstituting the public good that this strategy can then exploit. This prevents a complete collapse where everyone defects and payoffs dwindle to zero.
                *   **Else (`c_others_prev >= floor(n_others / 2)`, Cooperation is sufficient):**
                    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                    *   **Rationale:** When a sufficient number of other players are contributing, this strategy capitalizes on their generosity by free-riding. By defecting, this player keeps their private token while still benefiting from the collective good created by others, thus maximizing personal payoff. This is the core exploitative move.

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy is inherently exploitative because:
*   It prioritizes its own payoff, even at the expense of collective efficiency.
*   It uses initial cooperation only as a means to encourage a larger pool for later free-riding.
*   Its default action in the adaptive phase is defection, only contributing strategically to prevent the collapse of the "resource" (cooperation) it intends to exploit.
*   It ruthlessly defects in the final rounds to extract maximum value without concern for future interactions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_58 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Free-Rider with Probing (AFRP)," aims to maximize individual payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. It balances the immediate incentive to defect with the need to maintain a sufficiently high level of overall cooperation to ensure there's something substantial to free-ride on. It is adaptive to opponent behavior and robust across various game settings.

---

### The Adaptive Free-Rider with Probing (AFRP) Strategy

**Objective:** To achieve high individual payoffs by strategically defecting (free-riding) when others are cooperating, and offering conditional cooperation probes to prevent the collapse of overall contributions, ensuring ongoing opportunities for exploitation.

**Strategy Parameters (Example Values - can be tuned):**
*   `initial_cooperate_rounds = 2`: Number of initial rounds to always contribute.
*   `endgame_rounds = 1`: Number of final rounds to always defect.
*   `high_cooperation_threshold = 0.6`: If the average contribution rate of others is at or above this, defect.
*   `low_cooperation_threshold = 0.2`: If the average contribution rate of others falls to or below this, consider a cooperation probe.
*   `probe_interval = 5`: How often (in rounds) a cooperation probe might be attempted if conditions for low cooperation are met.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Phase 1: Initial Cooperation (Rounds 1 to `initial_cooperate_rounds`)**
    *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the very first rounds, contribute to signal a willingness to cooperate. This encourages other players to also contribute, thereby establishing a baseline of group cooperation that can be exploited in later rounds. Without this initial signal, the game might quickly devolve into universal defection, yielding low payoffs for everyone.

2.  **Phase 2: Adaptive Exploitation & Probing (Round `initial_cooperate_rounds + 1` to `r - endgame_rounds`)**
    *   In each round within this phase, analyze the previous round's contributions from other players:
        *   Calculate `past_round_contributions_of_others = sum_{j!=self} c_j_previous_round`.
        *   Calculate `other_players_count = n - 1`.
        *   Determine `other_cooperation_rate = past_round_contributions_of_others / other_players_count`.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `other_cooperation_rate >= high_cooperation_threshold`:**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** Others are contributing sufficiently. This is the prime opportunity to free-ride, maximizing personal gain by retaining the token while benefiting from the common pool.
        *   **Else (i.e., `other_cooperation_rate < high_cooperation_threshold`):**
            *   **If `current_round % probe_interval == 0` AND `other_cooperation_rate <= low_cooperation_threshold`:**
                *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
                *   **Rationale:** If overall cooperation is low and it's a designated "probe" round, contribute a token. This acts as a signal to potentially re-ignite cooperation among other players. While a short-term cost, it can encourage others to contribute again, creating larger future free-riding opportunities.
            *   **Else (i.e., `other_cooperation_rate` is low but not *critically* low, or it's not a "probe" round):**
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
                *   **Rationale:** If cooperation is dwindling and it's not a designated "probe" attempt, there's little to free-ride on. Contributing would make this player a "sucker" without significant collective benefit, so it's better to protect one's endowment.

3.  **Phase 3: Endgame Defection (Round `r - endgame_rounds + 1` to `r`)**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds of the game, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. Rational players will defect to maximize their immediate payoff, as there are no consequences for damaging future cooperation. Therefore, this player should also defect to avoid being exploited.

**Handling Edge Cases:**
*   **First Round (`current_round = 1`):** Covered by Phase 1.
*   **Last Round (`current_round = r`):** Covered by Phase 3.
*   **Very Short Games (`r` is small):** If `initial_cooperate_rounds + endgame_rounds >= r`, the Adaptive Exploitation & Probing phase will be skipped, and the strategy will execute only the initial cooperation and/or endgame defection. For example, if `r=3`, `initial_cooperate_rounds=2`, `endgame_rounds=1`, then round 1 and 2 are C, and round 3 is D. This is an appropriate fallback for short games.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_59 = '''
This strategy, named "The Opportunistic Free-Rider (OFR)", is designed to maximize its own payoff by adapting to observed opponent behavior, free-riding when possible, and strategically minimizing contributions while preventing the complete collapse of the public good when it's beneficial to do so. It leverages the game's parameters and phases to exploit common cooperative tendencies.

**Strategy: The Opportunistic Free-Rider (OFR)**

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (`1 < k < n`)
*   `r`: Total number of rounds

**Decision Rules (for current Round `t`):**

1.  **Phase 1: Initial Defection (Round 1)**
    *   **Condition:** `t == 1`
    *   **Action:** Defect (D) - Contribute 0 tokens.
    *   **Rationale:** On the very first round, the strategy plays defensively by defecting. This allows it to observe all other players' initial tendencies without cost. It avoids being the first "sucker" and establishes a low-cooperation baseline for its own behavior.

2.  **Phase 2: End-Game Exploitation (Final Rounds)**
    *   **Condition:** `t > r - max(1, floor(r/4))`
    *   **Action:** Defect (D) - Contribute 0 tokens.
    *   **Rationale:** As the game approaches its end, the incentive to cooperate diminishes due to backward induction. There is no future to influence, so the dominant strategy of defection becomes optimal. This phase ensures the strategy capitalizes on this game-theoretic certainty, maximizing personal gain in the final rounds. The duration of this phase is set to a minimum of 1 round, extending to up to 25% of the total rounds for longer games.

3.  **Phase 3: Adaptive Exploitation (All other rounds)**
    *   **Condition:** `t > 1` AND `t <= r - max(1, floor(r/4))`
    *   **Logic:** In these rounds, the strategy adapts based on the observed behavior of other players in the previous round.
        *   Let `P_others_prev` be the **proportion of other players** who contributed in the *previous round (t-1)*.
        *   `P_others_prev = (sum of c_j for all j != i in round t-1) / (n-1)`

        *   **Sub-Rule 3.1: Low Cooperation Detected**
            *   **Condition:** `P_others_prev < 0.2` (Less than 20% of others contributed)
            *   **Action:** Defect (D) - Contribute 0 tokens.
            *   **Rationale:** If too few others are contributing, the public good is too small to be worth investing in. Contributing would likely result in a net loss. This prevents being exploited by a predominantly defecting group.

        *   **Sub-Rule 3.2: High Cooperation Detected**
            *   **Condition:** `P_others_prev >= 0.75` (75% or more of others contributed)
            *   **Action:** Defect (D) - Contribute 0 tokens.
            *   **Rationale:** This is the prime free-riding opportunity. Others are generating a substantial public good, from which the strategy benefits without incurring personal cost. Maximally exploits collective generosity.

        *   **Sub-Rule 3.3: Moderate Cooperation Detected (The Tipping Point)**
            *   **Condition:** `0.2 <= P_others_prev < 0.75` (Between 20% and 75% of others contributed)
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C) with a probability `p`, otherwise Defect (D).
            *   **Probability `p`:** `p = P_others_prev * (k / n)`
            *   **Rationale:** In this range, the strategy might influence the continuation of cooperation.
                *   By contributing with a calculated probability, the strategy provides a minimal "reward" or "signal" to conditional cooperators, preventing a full collapse of contributions that would hurt its own long-term payoff.
                *   The multiplier `(k / n)` ensures that the contribution probability `p` is always *less* than `P_others_prev` (since `k/n < 1`). This means the strategy contributes less frequently than the average cooperator, even when attempting to sustain cooperation, thus maintaining its exploitative nature.
                *   The probabilistic nature also makes the strategy less predictable, which can be robust against counter-strategies.

**Edge Cases:**
*   **`r = 1` (Single Round Game):** Phase 1 applies (`t == 1`), resulting in Defect (D). This is the Nash Equilibrium.
*   **`r = 2` (Two-Round Game):** Phase 1 applies for `t=1` (D). Phase 2 applies for `t=2` (`t > 2 - max(1, floor(2/4))` which simplifies to `t > 1`), resulting in D. Total: D, D.
*   **`r = 3` (Three-Round Game):** Phase 1 for `t=1` (D). Phase 2 for `t=3` (`t > 3 - max(1, floor(3/4))` which simplifies to `t > 2`), resulting in D. For `t=2`, Phase 3 applies, allowing for adaptive behavior. Total: D, Adaptive, D.

This strategy balances aggressive free-riding with tactical contributions to sustain a profitable environment, making it adaptive, robust, and explicitly exploitative.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_60 = '''
This strategy, named "The Self-Preserving Parasite," is designed to be highly exploitative by defaulting to free-riding, but it is sufficiently adaptive and robust to make minimal, calculated contributions to prevent the complete collapse of the common good, thereby preserving long-term opportunities for exploitation.

**Parameters:**

*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for total contributions (1 < k < n).
*   **Exploitation Threshold (ET)**: A fractional value (e.g., 0.6). If the fraction of *other players* who contributed in the previous round is at or above this threshold, the common pool is considered robust enough for direct exploitation.
*   **Collapse Threshold (CT)**: A fractional value (e.g., 0.2). If the fraction of *other players* who contributed in the previous round is below this threshold, the common pool is considered too weak or collapsed, making contributions futile.
*   **Reactivation Trigger (RT)**: An integer (e.g., 3). This represents the number of consecutive rounds the strategy has defected while the group's cooperation level was in the "Critical Zone" (between CT and ET), which will trigger a temporary re-engagement contribution.

**Internal State (maintained across rounds):**

*   `consecutive_defections_in_critical_zone`: An integer counter initialized to 0. It tracks how many consecutive rounds the strategy has defected while the group's cooperation was in the Critical Zone. It resets to 0 if the strategy contributes, or if the group's cooperation moves outside the Critical Zone.

---

**Decision Rules (for round `t`):**

1.  **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** There is no past history to analyze. Starting with defection establishes an initial free-riding stance and tests the waters for opponent behavior without any initial cost.

2.  **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences or opportunities for retaliation. The individual incentive to maximize immediate payoff by defecting is absolute, as any contribution would be a pure loss with no potential for future gain.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**

    a.  **Observe Previous Round's Cooperation:**
        *   Retrieve `C_others_prev`: The total number of *other players* who contributed in round `t-1`.
        *   Calculate `fraction_others_coop`: `C_others_prev / (n-1)`. This represents the proportion of other players who cooperated.

    b.  **Evaluate the State of the Common Pool:**

        *   **Scenario 1: Robust Pool (High Cooperation)**
            *   **If `fraction_others_coop >= Exploitation Threshold (ET)`:**
                *   Reset `consecutive_defections_in_critical_zone` to 0.
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
                *   **Rationale:** The other players are contributing sufficiently, creating a healthy common pool that can be profitably exploited without immediate adverse effects. Maximize immediate payoff by free-riding.

        *   **Scenario 2: Collapsed Pool (Very Low Cooperation)**
            *   **If `fraction_others_coop < Collapse Threshold (CT)`:**
                *   Reset `consecutive_defections_in_critical_zone` to 0.
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
                *   **Rationale:** There is too little cooperation to make a personal contribution worthwhile. The pool is too weak or has already collapsed; a single contribution from this strategy is unlikely to revive it, and would primarily be a wasted effort.

        *   **Scenario 3: Critical Zone (Moderate Cooperation, between CT and ET)**
            *   **If `Collapse Threshold (CT) <= fraction_others_coop < Exploitation Threshold (ET)`:**
                *   Increment `consecutive_defections_in_critical_zone` by 1.
                *   **Check for Reactivation Trigger:**
                    *   **If `consecutive_defections_in_critical_zone >= Reactivation Trigger (RT)`:**
                        *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)** (Contribute 1 token).
                        *   **Rationale:** The strategy has been free-riding for too long in an environment where the common pool is fragile but still viable. This calculated contribution serves as a "bribe" or a signal to re-engage potential conditional cooperators among other players, preventing the pool from fully collapsing due to this strategy's consistent defection. It's a strategic, minimal investment to ensure future opportunities for exploitation.
                        *   Reset `consecutive_defections_in_critical_zone` to 0.
                    *   **Else (Not enough consecutive defections to trigger contribution):**
                        *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
                        *   **Rationale:** Continue to free-ride. The common pool is still above the collapse threshold, and this strategy hasn't yet been "too" exploitative to warrant a re-engagement contribution.

---

**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**

This strategy embodies an exploitative mindset by:
1.  **Defaulting to Defection:** Its primary action is to free-ride, maximizing individual payoff by avoiding contribution costs.
2.  **Conditional, Minimal Contribution:** It only contributes when strategically necessary to prevent a total collapse of the public good, which would eliminate future exploitation opportunities. These contributions are not for altruistic reasons but for self-preservation of the exploitation mechanism.
3.  **Adaptive Self-Interest:** It continuously monitors group behavior and adapts its actions to ensure a balance between maximizing immediate gains and sustaining the conditions for long-term free-riding.
4.  **No Genuine Cooperation:** Its contributions are transactional and brief, designed only to "recharge" the system, after which it immediately reverts to defection.

### **Strategy: The Opportunistic Free-Rider**

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Bait Phase):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute 1 token (C).
    *   **Reasoning:** This initial contribution is a calculated investment. It aims to signal willingness to cooperate to other players, potentially encouraging them to contribute more in subsequent rounds. This establishes a higher baseline of collective contributions, which then provides a richer environment for this strategy to exploit.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`):**
    *   **Information Gathering:** At the beginning of the current round `t`, observe the actions of all other `n-1` players from the *previous round* (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculate `Average_Cooperation_Other_Players_Prev_Round`:**
        *   `Avg_Coop = (sum of contributions by all *other* players in round t-1) / (n - 1)`
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `Avg_Coop` is greater than or equal to `Threshold_to_Reactivate_Cooperation` (i.e., >= 0.35):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D) – Contribute 0 tokens.
            *   **Reasoning:** The public good is sufficiently supported by others. This strategy will aggressively free-ride, maximizing its individual payoff without contributing, as long as the collective contribution level is healthy enough to yield significant benefits.
        *   **If `Avg_Coop` is less than `Threshold_to_Reactivate_Cooperation` (i.e., < 0.35):**
            *   **Action:** Contribute 1 token (C).
            *   **Reasoning:** The collective cooperation level has dropped below a critical point, threatening the profitability of future free-riding. To prevent the public good from collapsing entirely, this strategy makes a temporary, strategic contribution. This is not altruism, but an investment to "re-activate" cooperation in the group, thereby preserving the environment for future exploitation.

*   **Final Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D) – Contribute 0 tokens.
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future interactions for players to react to. The incentive to maintain cooperation or influence future behavior vanishes. Therefore, maximizing immediate payoff dictates defection.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**
*   **First Round:** Explicitly handled by the "Initial Bait Phase" rule.
*   **Last Round:** Explicitly handled by the "Final Round" rule.
*   **Empty History:** The strategy's initial action in Round 1 does not depend on past history, so it handles an empty history naturally.

**3. Exploitative Mindset:**
*   **Prioritizes Defection:** The strategy defaults to defection whenever the public good is sufficiently sustained by others, clearly demonstrating a free-riding inclination.
*   **Strategic Contribution:** Contributions are made only as a calculated, self-serving measure to prevent the public good (the source of exploitation) from collapsing, or as an initial "bait" to encourage others. It's an investment in future free-riding opportunities, not a genuine act of cooperation.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** The strategy continuously monitors and adapts to the collective behavior of others, ensuring it exploits robust cooperation while intervening minimally and strategically to avert unprofitable collapse.
*   **No Altruism:** Every decision, including temporary contributions, is aimed at maximizing its own long-term payoff, reflecting a purely self-interested and opportunistic approach.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_62 = '''
The following strategy, "Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to be exploitative, adaptive, and robust in the Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize individual payoff by strategically free-riding on others' contributions while selectively contributing to maintain a sufficient pool of cooperators for future exploitation, and to avoid being endlessly exploited itself.

---

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Free-Rider**

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for total contributions.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `current_round`: The current round number (1 to r).
*   `history`: A complete record of all players' contributions in all previous rounds.

**Internal State Variable (persists across rounds):**
*   `my_consecutive_solo_contributions`: An integer counter, initialized to 0 at the start of the game. This tracks how many consecutive rounds this player has contributed (Action: C) while all other players (n-1) have simultaneously defected (C_others_prev_round == 0).

**Decision Logic:**

1.  **First Round (current_round == 1):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution serves as a probing mechanism to assess the cooperativeness of the other players. It's a strategic investment to potentially "seed" cooperation, hoping to encourage others to contribute and thereby establish a baseline of collective contribution that can be exploited in subsequent rounds.

2.  **Last Round (current_round == r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions or consequences. The incentive to maintain cooperation for future benefit disappears. Defecting becomes the strictly dominant strategy to maximize immediate personal payoff without fear of retaliation.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < current_round < r):**

    a.  **Calculate `C_others_prev_round`:**
        *   Sum the contributions of all `(n-1)` other players in the immediately preceding round (`current_round - 1`).
        *   `C_others_prev_round = sum(contributions of player j for j != self in round (current_round - 1))`

    b.  **Update `my_consecutive_solo_contributions`:**
        *   If `C_others_prev_round == 0` (meaning all other players defected in the previous round) AND this player contributed (C) in `current_round - 1`:
            *   Increment `my_consecutive_solo_contributions` by 1.
        *   Else (if others contributed at least something, or if this player defected in `current_round - 1`):
            *   Reset `my_consecutive_solo_contributions` to 0.

    c.  **Define `Exploitation_Threshold`:**
        *   This threshold determines the minimum level of collective contribution from others that is considered sufficient for this strategy to safely free-ride.
        *   `Exploitation_Threshold = max(1, floor((n - 1) * k / n))`
        *   *Rationale:* This threshold reflects the necessary level of other players' contributions for the public good to be 'robust' enough for exploitation. If `k/n` is small, a lower number of cooperators is needed to reach this threshold, reflecting that cooperation is inherently difficult to sustain, so the strategy takes its immediate gains. If `k/n` is large (closer to 1), a higher number of cooperators is needed, as cooperation is more easily sustained, demanding a larger base before risking destabilization. The `max(1, ...)` ensures the threshold is at least one cooperator (assuming `n > 1`).

    d.  **Decision Logic for Intermediate Rounds:**

        i.  **If `C_others_prev_round >= Exploitation_Threshold`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   *Rationale:* The environment is sufficiently cooperative. There are enough other players contributing to the public good that this strategy can safely free-ride on their efforts, maximizing personal gain without immediately risking the collapse of cooperation. The `my_consecutive_solo_contributions` counter would have been reset in step (3b) if this condition was met, confirming this player is not currently a "sucker."

        ii. **Else (`C_others_prev_round < Exploitation_Threshold`):**
            *   **If `my_consecutive_solo_contributions >= 2`:**
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   *Rationale:* This player has contributed alone for two or more consecutive rounds without sufficient reciprocation or collective contribution from others (`C_others_prev_round` remains too low or zero). Continuing to contribute in such an uncooperative environment would be a "sucker's payoff." This rule is crucial for robustness, preventing endless exploitation of this strategy and signalling an unwillingness to contribute if others aren't making sufficient collective effort to be exploited.

            *   **Else (`my_consecutive_solo_contributions < 2`):**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   *Rationale:* Cooperation levels are currently too low for profitable free-riding, but this player has not been a "sucker" for too long. This is a strategic, temporary contribution, an attempt to "re-seed" or encourage cooperation from others. The aim is to raise `C_others_prev_round` above the `Exploitation_Threshold` in future rounds, thereby rebuilding the pool of cooperators for subsequent exploitation opportunities.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_63 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to be highly exploitative by maximizing personal gain through strategic defection while selectively attempting to re-ignite cooperation only when it directly serves the long-term goal of free-riding. It is adaptive to opponent behaviors and robust against various play styles, including always-defect, always-cooperate, and reciprocal strategies.

**Strategy: The Adaptive Free-Rider**

**1. Strategy Parameters:**

*   **`Initial_Probe_Rounds` = 1**: The number of initial rounds this strategy will contribute to "probe" the environment for cooperators.
*   **`Free_Ride_Threshold` = 1**: The minimum number of *other* players who contributed in the previous round for this strategy to continue to **Defect** (free-ride). A low threshold means aggressive free-riding.
*   **`Zero_Coop_Tolerance_Rounds` = 3**: The number of consecutive rounds where *no other players* contributed before this strategy considers attempting to "reboot" cooperation.
*   **`Max_Reboot_Attempts` = 2**: The maximum number of times this strategy will attempt to "reboot" cooperation by contributing, if others consistently defect after a probe.

**2. Internal State Variables (Managed by the strategy):**

*   `rounds_of_zero_other_contributions_consecutive`: Counts consecutive rounds where `sum_j c_j(t-1)` (excluding self) was zero. Resets when `sum_j c_j(t-1) > 0`.
*   `current_reboot_attempts_made`: Counts how many times this strategy has performed a "reboot" contribution.

**3. Decision Rules (Action for Player `i` in round `t`):**

*   Let `S_C_others(t-1)` be the sum of contributions from all *other* players in the previous round (`t-1`).

    **a. First Round (`t = 1`)**:
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
        *   Rationale: This is an initial strategic "investment" or "probe". It serves to signal potential cooperation, encouraging reciprocal strategies to contribute, and to test the overall willingness of the group to cooperate, which this strategy then intends to exploit.
    *   Initialize `rounds_of_zero_other_contributions_consecutive = 0`.
    *   Initialize `current_reboot_attempts_made = 0`.

    **b. Intermediate Rounds (`t` from 2 to `r-1`)**:

    *   **If `S_C_others(t-1) >= Free_Ride_Threshold` (i.e., at least one other player contributed last round)**:
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   Rationale: Sufficient cooperation exists to free-ride. This is the core exploitative action, maximizing individual payoff by benefiting from others' contributions without incurring the cost.
        *   Reset `rounds_of_zero_other_contributions_consecutive = 0`.

    *   **If `S_C_others(t-1) < Free_Ride_Threshold` (i.e., no other player contributed last round)**:
        *   Increment `rounds_of_zero_other_contributions_consecutive`.
        *   **If `rounds_of_zero_other_contributions_consecutive >= Zero_Coop_Tolerance_Rounds` AND `current_reboot_attempts_made < Max_Reboot_Attempts`**:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
                *   Rationale: The pool of cooperation has dried up completely. This is a calculated risk to "reboot" the system. By contributing, the strategy attempts to re-induce cooperation in others, re-establishing an exploitable environment. This is not for altruism, but to prevent the game from degenerating into a state where there's nothing to exploit (payoff of 1 for everyone).
            *   Increment `current_reboot_attempts_made`.
            *   Reset `rounds_of_zero_other_contributions_consecutive = 0`.

        *   **Else (not enough consecutive zero-coop rounds, or max reboots reached)**:
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
                *   Rationale: There's no cooperation to exploit, and either it's too early to try a reboot, or the strategy has exhausted its allowed reboot attempts, indicating that others are unresponsive. In this scenario, contributing would be a net loss without expected future gains from free-riding, so defecting (which guarantees 1 token if no one else contributes) is the individually rational choice.

    **c. Last Round (`t = r`)**:
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
        *   Rationale: In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. The individual dominant strategy is to defect to maximize immediate payoff, as there are no long-term consequences for future rounds.

**4. Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:**

*   **Strategic Investment**: The initial contribution and subsequent re-boot attempts are not acts of genuine cooperation but calculated investments designed to *induce* cooperation in others, creating a larger shared pool for the strategy to free-ride on.
*   **Aggressive Free-Riding**: The strategy defaults to defecting whenever there's sufficient cooperation (`Free_Ride_Threshold = 1`), aggressively maximizing its immediate payoff by avoiding contribution costs.
*   **Limited Risk**: The strategy limits its exposure to unreciprocated contributions through `Zero_Coop_Tolerance_Rounds` and `Max_Reboot_Attempts`, ensuring it doesn't become a perpetual "sucker" against uncooperative opponents. It prioritizes its own returns and minimizes losses when exploitation is not viable.
*   **Adaptive Withdrawal**: When the environment is not conducive to exploitation (i.e., persistent defection from others), the strategy withdraws by consistently defecting, securing a baseline payoff and avoiding futile contributions.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_64 = '''
**Strategy Name: The Adaptive Opportunist**

This strategy is designed to be highly exploitative by strategically manipulating cooperation levels among other players to maximize its own free-riding opportunities, while safeguarding against the complete collapse of the public good. It adapts to observed behavior, using contributions as an investment or a bait, and defecting whenever a sufficient public good has been established by others.

**Key Parameters:**

*   **`Initial_Probe_Rounds = 2`**: The number of initial rounds during which the strategy will always contribute.
*   **`Endgame_Defection_Rounds = 1`**: The number of final rounds during which the strategy will always defect.
*   **`High_Cooperation_Threshold = 0.5`**: If the average contribution rate of other players exceeds this value, the strategy will free-ride.
*   **`Low_Cooperation_Threshold = 0.2`**: If the average contribution rate of other players falls below this value, the strategy will contribute to try and revive cooperation.

**Decision Rules (for player `i` in `current_round`):**

The strategy operates in three distinct phases:

1.  **Initial Probing Phase (`current_round <= Initial_Probe_Rounds`)**
    *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
    *   **Rationale:** This phase aims to signal an initial willingness to cooperate, acting as an "investment" to encourage other players to contribute and establish a baseline of collective welfare. It helps identify potential cooperators and sets the stage for future exploitation.

2.  **Endgame Exploitation Phase (`current_round > r - Endgame_Defection_Rounds`)**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** As the game approaches its end, the incentive for maintaining cooperation or building reputation vanishes. Defection becomes the dominant strategy, maximizing immediate individual payoff without consequences for future rounds. This phase capitalizes on the game's finite horizon.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (`Initial_Probe_Rounds < current_round <= r - Endgame_Defection_Rounds`)**
    *   In this core phase, the strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the observed contributions of other players in the *previous* round.
    *   First, calculate `avg_other_contributions_prev_round`, which is the sum of contributions of all other players in `current_round - 1`, divided by `(n-1)`.
        `avg_other_contributions_prev_round = (sum_{j!=i} c_j^{current_round-1}) / (n-1)`
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `avg_other_contributions_prev_round >= High_Cooperation_Threshold`:**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** A high level of cooperation among others indicates a healthy public good. In this scenario, the strategy free-rides to maximize personal gain, as its defection is unlikely to cause a significant collapse of the collective pool.
        *   **If `avg_other_contributions_prev_round < Low_Cooperation_Threshold`:**
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   **Rationale:** Cooperation levels are critically low, risking the complete collapse of the public good and eliminating future free-riding opportunities. The strategy contributes here as a "re-investment" to prevent total failure, hoping to encourage others to resume contributing, thus rebuilding a pool to exploit again.
        *   **If `Low_Cooperation_Threshold <= avg_other_contributions_prev_round < High_Cooperation_Threshold` (Moderate Cooperation):**
            *   This is a nuanced zone where the strategy adapts to its *own* previous action to maintain a balance of exploitation and stability.
            *   If player `i` **contributed (C)** in `current_round - 1`:
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
                *   **Rationale:** Having contributed last round, the strategy attempts to free-ride this round, testing the resilience of cooperation and extracting immediate value.
            *   If player `i` **defected (D)** in `current_round - 1`:
                *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
                *   **Rationale:** Having defected last round, the strategy contributes now to prevent further decay of cooperation and to signal potential willingness to cooperate, trying to bait others into contributing more, thereby setting up future exploitation opportunities.

**Edge Cases Handled:**

*   **First Round (`current_round = 1`):** Addressed by the "Initial Probing Phase" (always Contribute).
*   **Last Round (`current_round = r`):** Addressed by the "Endgame Exploitation Phase" (always Defect).
*   **Very Short Games:** If `Initial_Probe_Rounds + Endgame_Defection_Rounds >= r`, the Adaptive Exploitation Phase will be automatically skipped, and the strategy will execute only the initial probes followed by endgame defection, ensuring logical behavior even in short-duration games.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_65 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Predator," is designed to maximize its own payoff in the Public Goods Game by strategically free-riding on the contributions of others. It aims to exploit cooperative tendencies while being adaptive to maintain a minimum level of public good for its own benefit, and robust enough to avoid being a long-term "sucker" if cooperation utterly collapses.

**Core Principle:**
The Adaptive Predator's primary goal is to contribute as little as possible while encouraging or maintaining others' contributions. It uses limited, calculated cooperation as a tool for inducing or re-establishing a public good from which it can then free-ride, always prioritizing its own immediate and long-term gains.

**State Variables (maintained across rounds):**
*   **Current Round:** The ongoing round number (from 1 to `r`).
*   **My Past Actions:** A historical record of this strategy's own contributions (0 or 1) in all previous rounds.
*   **All Players' Past Actions:** A historical record of every player's contributions (0 or 1) in all previous rounds. This allows calculating others' average contribution.
*   **Current Phase:** An internal state indicating the strategy's current objective:
    *   `INITIAL_BAIT`: Establishing initial goodwill.
    *   `EXPLOITING`: The default state of free-riding.
    *   `REINDUCING_COOP`: Actively contributing to restore falling cooperation.
*   **Re-Induce Counter:** A numerical counter tracking how many rounds the strategy has contributed while in the `REINDUCING_COOP` phase.
*   **Futility Counter:** A numerical counter tracking consecutive rounds where other players' average contribution has been extremely low, signaling a potential collapse of cooperation.

**Parameters (Internal Tunable Values):**
The following parameters guide the strategy's behavior and can be adjusted based on anticipated opponent types or game specifics:
*   `COOP_BAIT_ROUNDS = 2`: The number of initial rounds to contribute (bait) to signal cooperativeness and gather initial data.
*   `ENDGAME_DEFECT_ROUNDS = 3`: The number of final rounds during which the strategy will unconditionally defect, leveraging backward induction.
*   `COOP_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5`: If the average contribution of other players in the previous round falls below this value (e.g., 50% of players contributed), it signals that cooperation is deteriorating and intervention might be needed.
*   `REIND_COOP_DURATION = 2`: The number of rounds the strategy will commit to contributing when attempting to re-induce cooperation.
*   `FUTILITY_THRESHOLD = 0.1`: An extremely low average contribution from others (e.g., 10%) that suggests cooperation is critically low or non-existent.
*   `FUTILITY_ROUNDS_GIVE_UP = 3`: The number of consecutive rounds the average contribution must stay below `FUTILITY_THRESHOLD` before the strategy concludes that cooperation is futile and gives up trying to re-induce it.

---

**Decision Rules (Executed each round):**

**1. Initial Setup (Before Round 1):**
   *   Initialize `Current Phase` to `INITIAL_BAIT`.
   *   Set `Re-Induce Counter` to 0.
   *   Set `Futility Counter` to 0.

**2. End Game Override:**
   *   **If** `Current Round` is greater than `total_rounds - ENDGAME_DEFECT_ROUNDS`:
     *   **Action: Defect (Contribute 0).**
     *   *Rationale:* In the final rounds, there is no future to influence. Pure self-interest dictates defection to maximize immediate payoff, as any attempt to induce cooperation would be wasted.

**3. Calculate Others' Previous Cooperation (for rounds after the first):**
   *   **If** `Current Round > 1`:
     *   Calculate `avg_others_c_prev_round` by summing the contributions of all other players in the immediately preceding round (`Current Round - 1`) and dividing by `(n-1)`.
   *   **Else (Round 1):** `avg_others_c_prev_round` is not applicable for calculations and should not trigger `Futility Counter` or `COOP_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD` checks yet.

**4. Update Futility Counter:**
   *   **If** `Current Round > 1` (i.e., `avg_others_c_prev_round` is available):
     *   **If** `avg_others_c_prev_round < FUTILITY_THRESHOLD`:
       *   Increment `Futility Counter`.
     *   **Else:**
       *   Reset `Futility Counter` to 0.

**5. Futility Check (Give Up on Cooperation):**
   *   **If** `Current Phase` is not `INITIAL_BAIT` **AND** `Futility Counter` is greater than or equal to `FUTILITY_ROUNDS_GIVE_UP`:
     *   **Action: Defect (Contribute 0).**
     *   Transition `Current Phase` to `EXPLOITING`.
     *   Reset `Re-Induce Counter` to 0.
     *   *Rationale:* If other players have consistently shown extremely low cooperation for a prolonged period, attempting to re-induce cooperation is likely a futile and costly endeavor. The strategy will cease its efforts to foster cooperation and switch to a purely self-interested defection stance, effectively giving up on the public good.

**6. Phase-Specific Actions:**

   *   **If `Current Phase` is `INITIAL_BAIT`:**
       *   **If** `Current Round` is less than or equal to `COOP_BAIT_ROUNDS`:
           *   **Action: Contribute (1).**
           *   *Rationale:* Establish initial goodwill and "bait" other players into contributing, creating a foundation for future free-riding.
       *   **Else (`Current Round` is greater than `COOP_BAIT_ROUNDS`):**
           *   Transition `Current Phase` to `EXPLOITING`.
           *   **Action: Defect (0).**
           *   *Rationale:* The initial baiting period is complete; the strategy now proceeds to its default state of exploitation.

   *   **If `Current Phase` is `REINDUCING_COOP`:**
       *   **If** `Re-Induce Counter` is less than `REIND_COOP_DURATION`:
           *   **Action: Contribute (1).**
           *   Increment `Re-Induce Counter`.
           *   *Rationale:* Continue fulfilling the commitment to contribute for the set duration, attempting to bring cooperation levels back up.
       *   **Else (`Re-Induce Counter` is equal to `REIND_COOP_DURATION`):**
           *   Transition `Current Phase` to `EXPLOITING`.
           *   Reset `Re-Induce Counter` to 0.
           *   **Action: Defect (0).**
           *   *Rationale:* The required period of re-induction is complete; revert to free-riding.

   *   **If `Current Phase` is `EXPLOITING`:**
       *   **If** `avg_others_c_prev_round` is less than `COOP_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD`:
           *   Transition `Current Phase` to `REINDUCING_COOP`.
           *   Set `Re-Induce Counter` to 1 (because it will contribute in this round).
           *   **Action: Contribute (1).**
           *   *Rationale:* Others' cooperation is deteriorating below a critical level. A temporary, calculated contribution is made as an investment to prevent total collapse of the public good, allowing for future free-riding. This is a pragmatic move to protect its own potential for exploitation.
       *   **Else (`avg_others_c_prev_round` is at or above `COOP_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD`):**
           *   **Action: Defect (0).**
           *   *Rationale:* Others are contributing sufficiently; continue to free-ride to maximize personal gain without needing to make any sacrifices.

The following strategy, "The Calculated Free-Rider," is designed for exploitation in the repeated Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize individual payoff by strategically leveraging the contributions of others while minimizing its own contributions. The strategy adapts to observed opponent behavior and game parameters, ensuring robustness across various scenarios.

**Strategy Name:** The Calculated Free-Rider

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Initial Probing:** Contribute briefly at the start to identify potential cooperators and establish a baseline. Without any cooperation, there is nothing to exploit.
2.  **Endgame Defection:** Always defect in the final round to maximize immediate, non-consequential gains.
3.  **Conditional Exploitation:** In the main phase, default to defection. Only contribute strategically when cooperation is moderately low, to "re-seed" the public good for future exploitation, never when contributions are too high (free-riding opportunity) or too low (lost cause).

**Parameters (Dynamically Calculated):**

*   **`Initial_RRounds_Count`**: Number of initial rounds to unconditionally contribute.
    *   Calculated as `max(1, min(3, r // 5))`. This means at least 1 round, at most 3 rounds, or 20% of total rounds, whichever is smallest (e.g., for r=10, 2 rounds; for r=1, 1 round).
*   **`Hopeless_Threshold_Factor`**: The minimum average contribution rate from other players below which it's considered a "lost cause" to contribute.
    *   Set to `0.15` (15%).
*   **`Adaptive_Strategic_Threshold_Factor`**: The average contribution rate from other players above which it's considered high enough to exploit by defecting. It adapts to the game's multiplier.
    *   Calculated as `max(0.25, min(0.5, 0.2 + (k / n) * 0.3))`. This ensures the threshold scales with the potential benefit of the public good (higher `k/n` means higher tolerance for others' contributions before exploiting).

**Decision Rules:**

Let `current_round` be the current round number.
Let `S_others_prev` be the sum of contributions of the other `(n-1)` players in the *previous* round.

1.  **Initial Probing Phase (Round `current_round` <= `Initial_Rounds_Count`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
    *   **Reason:** This initial cooperation serves to identify responsive opponents and encourage a baseline level of contributions, which the strategy intends to exploit later. If all players defect from the start, there's no public good to benefit from.

2.  **End Game Phase (Round `current_round` == `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D)
    *   **Reason:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection. Contributing offers no strategic advantage for subsequent rounds, making immediate self-interest (keeping the token) the dominant choice.

3.  **Main Exploitation Phase (All other rounds: `Initial_Rounds_Count` < `current_round` < `r`):**

    *   Calculate the numerical thresholds based on `n-1` (the number of other players):
        *   `Min_Hopeless_Others = round((n-1) * Hopeless_Threshold_Factor)`
        *   `Min_Strategic_Others = round((n-1) * Adaptive_Strategic_Threshold_Factor)`
        *   *(Note: Ensure `Min_Hopeless_Others` and `Min_Strategic_Others` are at least 1 if `n-1 > 0`, to avoid division by zero or trivial thresholds if `n-1` is small. For example, use `max(1, round(...))`)*

    *   **If `n-1` is 0 (i.e., `n=1`):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D)
        *   **Reason:** No other players exist to contribute or exploit.
    *   **If `S_others_prev < Min_Hopeless_Others`:**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D)
        *   **Reason:** Cooperation among others is too low. It's a "lost cause," and contributing would be a waste of a token as it's unlikely to significantly shift overall contributions or yield sufficient future benefits to exploit.
    *   **Else if `S_others_prev < Min_Strategic_Others`:**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
        *   **Reason:** Others are contributing at a moderate level. My contribution is a strategic investment. It aims to encourage further contributions from others in subsequent rounds, hoping to push `S_others_prev` into the "exploitation zone" where I can profitably defect. This is a calculated attempt to revive cooperation for future free-riding.
    *   **Else (`S_others_prev >= Min_Strategic_Others`):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D)
        *   **Reason:** Others are contributing generously enough. I can maximize my immediate payoff by free-riding (keeping my token) without my defection significantly collapsing the public good or jeopardizing my future exploitation potential. This is the primary mode of exploitation.

**Robustness and Adaptability:**

*   This strategy is adaptive as its behavior in the main phase is dynamically determined by the observed contributions of other players.
*   It is robust against purely selfish players (Always Defect) by quickly switching to defection after initial probing, limiting losses.
*   It is robust against purely cooperative players (Always Cooperate) by free-riding for the majority of rounds.
*   Against conditional cooperators (e.g., Tit-for-Tat), it attempts to maintain contributions at a level that is profitable to exploit, oscillating between strategic cooperation and defection as needed. It aims to "trick" others into contributing to then free-ride.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_67 = '''
Here is an exploitative strategy designed for the Public Goods Game, incorporating adaptive behavior and robust rules for various game phases.

---

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Free-Rider (AFR)

**Core Principle:** This strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by strategically leveraging the cooperation of other players. It employs an initial "lure" phase to encourage collective contributions, followed by an "exploitation" phase where it free-rides on others' contributions, and a final "retreat" phase where it always defects. Its adaptation comes from monitoring the collective cooperation level of opponents during the exploitation phase.

**Parameters:**

*   `LureRounds`: Number of initial rounds to always contribute. (Recommended: `2`)
*   `ExploitThreshold`: The minimum percentage of *other* players who contributed in the previous round for this strategy to defect and free-ride. (Recommended: `0.5`, meaning if 50% or more of others contributed, free-ride).
*   `EndGameRounds`: Number of final rounds to always defect due to backward induction. (Recommended: `2`)

---

**Decision Rules (for each round `t` from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Single Round Game (Edge Case):**
    *   If `r = 1`:
        *   **Action:** Defect (D)
        *   **Rationale:** In a single-shot Public Goods Game, defecting is the dominant strategy regardless of what others do, as it always yields a higher immediate payoff.

2.  **Initial Lure Phase:**
    *   If `t <= LureRounds` (and `r > 1`):
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
        *   **Rationale:** Proactively contribute in the early rounds to signal a willingness to cooperate. This investment aims to encourage other players to also contribute, thereby establishing a higher level of collective good which can be exploited later.

3.  **End Game Phase:**
    *   If `t > r - EndGameRounds` (and `r > 1`):
        *   **Action:** Defect (D)
        *   **Rationale:** As the game approaches its end, there are no future interactions to influence. Based on backward induction, rational players will defect in the final rounds. This strategy defects early in the end game to maximize immediate payoff, knowing that the "pool" will likely collapse regardless.

4.  **Exploitation Phase (Adaptive Free-Riding):**
    *   If `LureRounds < t <= r - EndGameRounds`:
        *   **Observation:** Calculate the `Percentage_Others_Contributing_Prev` by taking the sum of contributions of all *other* players in the previous round (`t-1`) and dividing it by `(n-1)` (the number of other players).
            *   `Percentage_Others_Contributing_Prev = (Sum of c_j(t-1) for j != i) / (n - 1)`
        *   **Decision:**
            *   If `Percentage_Others_Contributing_Prev >= ExploitThreshold`:
                *   **Action:** Defect (D)
                *   **Rationale:** A sufficient number of other players are contributing, creating a substantial public good. This strategy chooses to free-ride on their contributions to maximize its own profit without contributing its own token.
            *   Else (`Percentage_Others_Contributing_Prev < ExploitThreshold`):
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
                *   **Rationale:** The level of cooperation among other players is below the threshold needed for optimal free-riding. This strategy contributes to try and boost the collective contribution, aiming to prevent a collapse of the public good and to encourage others to contribute more. This is a strategic investment to enable future exploitation.

---

**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**

This strategy is fundamentally exploitative because it prioritizes its own payoff maximization by:
*   **Luring:** Initiating cooperation only to build a pool it can later exploit.
*   **Free-Riding:** Actively defecting when others are contributing enough, thereby benefiting from the public good without contributing its share.
*   **Strategic Investment:** Only contributing when the collective pool is too low, not out of altruism, but as a calculated move to prevent total collapse and ensure there's still a pool to free-ride on in subsequent rounds.
*   **End-Game Defection:** Rationalizing defection in the final rounds, understanding that influencing future play is no longer possible.

This approach is adaptive as it responds to the actual cooperation levels of opponents and robust due to its clear phase-based rules and handling of edge cases.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_68 = '''
The Opportunistic Scavenger is an adaptive and exploitative strategy designed for the Public Goods Game. Its primary goal is to maximize personal payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. It strategically contributes only when necessary to prevent a complete collapse of the public good, which would eliminate future exploitation opportunities.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **For the last round (`current_round == r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**. By backward induction, there are no future rounds to influence. The rational choice in the final round is to defect and keep the private endowment, as any signaling or reputation building holds no value.

2.  **For the first round (`current_round == 1` AND `r > 1`):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**. This initial contribution serves as a strategic "bait" or an investment. It aims to signal a willingness to cooperate and potentially encourage other players to contribute, thereby establishing or kickstarting a public good pool for subsequent exploitation. (If `r=1`, this rule is superseded by the 'last round' rule).

3.  **For intermediate rounds (`1 < current_round < r`):**
    *   Observe `C_others_t-1`, the sum of contributions from the `n-1` other players in the *previous round* (`t-1`).
    *   Calculate the **Average Contribution Rate of Others (ACRO)**: `ACRO = C_others_t-1 / (n-1)`. This metric reflects the collective willingness of other players to contribute.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `ACRO == 0`:** (No other player contributed in the previous round).
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**. If the public good has completely collapsed (zero contributions from others), there is nothing to exploit. Contributing alone is a net loss (yielding `k/n` for a cost of 1, while defecting yields `1`), and futile for stimulating cooperation if everyone else has already committed to defection.
        *   **Else (`ACRO > 0`):** (At least one other player contributed in the previous round).
            *   **Define an "Exploitation Threshold" (ET):** Let `ET = k / n`. This threshold represents the per-unit benefit derived from contributions relative to the cost of contributing. It serves as an indicator of the group's "health" in terms of sustainable contributions.
            *   **If `ACRO >= ET`:** The level of cooperation from others is considered "sufficient" to comfortably free-ride. They are contributing enough to maintain a worthwhile public good from which to benefit.
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**. Maximize immediate personal gain by keeping the private endowment and still benefiting from others' contributions.
            *   **Else (`0 < ACRO < ET`):** The level of cooperation from others is present but "too low" or appears to be dwindling below a sustainable level. To prevent a complete collapse of contributions (which would eliminate future exploitation opportunities), a strategic investment is made.
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)**. This is a calculated risk to try and re-stimulate or maintain contributions from others. This investment is made to preserve the public good as a resource for future exploitation.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_69 = '''
The following strategy, named "The Adaptive Opportunist," is designed to be exploitative, robust, and adaptive within the Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize its own payoff by strategically encouraging and then free-riding on others' contributions, while protecting itself from being a "sucker."

---

**Strategy: The Adaptive Opportunist**

This strategy prioritizes individual payoff by dynamically adjusting its contribution behavior based on observed collective cooperation. It combines an initial investment to foster cooperation, a core adaptive free-riding mechanism, and a definitive end-game defection.

**Game Parameters:**

*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier (where `1 < k < n`).

**Information Available:**

*   After each round, all players observe every player's past actions and payoffs.

**Decision Rules:**

The strategy's action in any given `current_round` (from 1 to `r`) is determined by the following prioritized rules:

1.  **Endgame Defection Phase:**
    *   **Condition:** If `current_round > r - 2` (i.e., this applies to the last two rounds of the game).
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds, there is no future interaction to influence, and no possibility of leveraging current contributions for future gain. Therefore, the strategy maximizes immediate payoff by defecting, aligning with standard backward induction principles for finite repeated games.

2.  **Opening Move Phase:**
    *   **Condition:** Else if `current_round == 1`.
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This initial contribution serves as an investment to "prime the pump." It signals a willingness to cooperate, which can encourage other players to contribute and establish a baseline of collective action. Without this initial seed, universal defection might establish quickly, leaving no public good to exploit.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase:**
    *   **Condition:** Else (i.e., for any round `t` where `1 < t <= r - 2`).
    *   **Assessment:** Observe the contributions of all *other* `n-1` players in the immediately preceding round (`current_round - 1`). Let `C_others_prev` be the count of these contributions.
    *   **Cooperation Threshold `T`:** Calculate a dynamic threshold `T = ceil((n - 1) / 2)`. This threshold defines what is considered "sufficient cooperation" from others. If more than half of the other players contributed in the previous round, cooperation is deemed sufficient.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `C_others_prev >= T`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** When a sufficient number of other players are contributing, the strategy enters its primary exploitative mode. It free-rides on the existing public good, maximizing its immediate individual payoff without contributing.
        *   **If `C_others_prev < T`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** If the level of cooperation among other players drops below the threshold, it signals a potential collapse of the public good. To prevent this, the strategy makes a strategic contribution. This is not altruism but an investment to try and "re-engage" or "re-prime" other players, encouraging them to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds. The goal is to restore a level of cooperation that can then be exploited again.

---

**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**

The Adaptive Opportunist is ruthlessly self-interested. It strategically initiates cooperation to create a pool for free-riding, then defects whenever that pool is adequately maintained by others. If collective contributions wane, it contributes briefly to revive the public good, not out of fairness, but to ensure there's a lucrative environment to exploit in subsequent rounds. Finally, it defects unconditionally in the last two rounds when future interactions cease to matter. This strategy is robust against various opponent types, effectively free-riding on cooperators, avoiding being a consistent "sucker" against defectors, and dynamically adapting to conditional players to maintain its exploitative advantage.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_70 = '''
This strategy, named "The Scavenger," is designed to be highly exploitative in the Public Goods Game. Its primary objective is to maximize its own payoff by largely free-riding on the contributions of others, only contributing when absolutely necessary to prevent the public good from collapsing entirely, thereby preserving future opportunities for exploitation.

**Strategy: The Scavenger**

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (where `1 < k < n`).

**Internal State (for Player i):**
*   `my_last_action`: Stores Player i's action in the previous round (initialized to 'Defect' before Round 1).
*   `rounds_since_my_last_contribution`: Counts how many consecutive rounds Player i has *not* contributed (initialized to 0).

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (t=1):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** There is no history to analyze. Starting with defection allows the Scavenger to test the willingness of other players to contribute without any personal investment, and it aligns with the dominant strategy in a single-shot game.
    *   **Update State:** `my_last_action = D`. `rounds_since_my_last_contribution = 1`.

2.  **Last Round (t=r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences to actions. Contributing would yield a lower payoff than defecting, regardless of others' actions. Exploitation dictates immediate self-maximization.
    *   **Update State:** Not relevant as the game ends.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**

    *   **Observation (from previous round `t-1`):**
        *   `total_other_contributions_prev`: Sum of contributions from all other `n-1` players in the previous round.
        *   `my_last_action` (from round `t-1`).
        *   `rounds_since_my_last_contribution` (from round `t-1`).

    *   **Decision Logic (Default and Override Condition):**

        *   **Default Action:** The Scavenger's default inclination is always to **Defect (D)**. This is the primary exploitative action, allowing it to free-ride on any existing contributions.

        *   **Override Condition (Consider Contributing - 'Priming'):**
            The Scavenger will temporarily **Contribute (C)**, overriding its default defection, **ONLY IF ALL** of the following conditions are met:
            1.  **Critical Collapse of Contributions:** `total_other_contributions_prev < 2`. This means either zero or only one other player contributed in the previous round, signaling a severe breakdown of the public good.
            2.  **Sufficient Remaining Game:** `r - t > ceil(0.1 * r)`. There must be at least 10% of the total rounds remaining. Contributing is an investment, and it's only worthwhile if there's enough future game to potentially recoup and exploit that investment. (Minimum of 1 round if `0.1*r` rounds to 0, but effectively 1+ round).
            3.  **My Previous Action was Defect:** `my_last_action == D`. The Scavenger only 'primes' after it has been defecting, not after it has already contributed. This prevents sustained contribution and ensures the priming is a reactive, corrective measure.
            4.  **Not Recently Primed:** `rounds_since_my_last_contribution >= 2`. The Scavenger ensures a minimum of two rounds of defection have passed since its last contribution. This prevents it from getting stuck in a cycle of contributing and ensures that any priming is a brief, tactical pulse, followed by a return to free-riding.

    *   **State Update after Action:**
        *   If Player i decided to **Contribute (C)** in the current round:
            *   `my_last_action = C`.
            *   `rounds_since_my_last_contribution = 0`.
        *   If Player i decided to **Defect (D)** in the current round:
            *   `my_last_action = D`.
            *   `rounds_since_my_last_contribution = rounds_since_my_last_contribution + 1`.

---

**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**

*   **Default to Free-Riding:** The strategy is hard-wired to defect, benefiting from others' contributions without personal cost.
*   **Strategic Priming:** Contributions are not acts of cooperation but calculated investments. They are deployed minimally and only when the public good (the source of exploitation) is severely threatened, and there's a clear opportunity to re-establish a pool for future free-riding.
*   **Avoidance of Sustained Cooperation:** The conditions for contributing are strict and designed to prevent the Scavenger from becoming a regular contributor. It primes briefly and then immediately reverts to defection, with a built-in waiting period before considering another prime.
*   **End-Game Rationality:** No value is placed on future reputation or cooperation in the final round, leading to an absolute defection.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_71 = '''
The goal of this strategy, named "Adaptive Free-Rider," is to maximize individual payoff by predominantly free-riding on the contributions of other players. It employs a dynamic approach, strategically contributing only when necessary to induce or sustain a collective pool of contributions, which it then exploits.

**Strategy: Adaptive Free-Rider**

This strategy operates in three distinct phases, determined by the current round relative to the total number of rounds (`r_total`).

**Parameters:**
*   `n_players`: The total number of players in the game.
*   `r_total`: The total number of rounds.
*   `initial_cooperation_rounds`: Determines the duration of the initial "seeding" phase. Calculated as `max(0, floor(r_total / 5))` for `r_total > 1`, and `0` for `r_total = 1`. (For a game with only 1 round, no initial seeding is performed.)
*   `end_game_start_round`: The first round of the "end game defection" phase. Calculated as `r_total - min(r_total, 3) + 1`. This means the last `min(r_total, 3)` rounds are treated as end game.
*   `high_contribution_threshold_ratio = 0.5`: If the proportion of *other* players contributing is above this, we strongly free-ride.
*   `low_contribution_threshold_ratio = 0.25`: If the proportion of *other* players contributing drops below this, we temporarily contribute to try and revive the pool.

**Decision Rules for Current Round (`current_round` is 1-indexed):**

1.  **End Game Defection Phase (`current_round >= end_game_start_round`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds, the individual incentive to contribute vanishes due to the absence of future interactions (backward induction). This strategy defects unconditionally to maximize its immediate payoff, as there is no long-term collective benefit to consider.

2.  **Initial Seeding Phase (`current_round <= initial_cooperation_rounds`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This initial phase acts as an investment to "seed" cooperation. By contributing, the strategy aims to signal potential cooperation and encourage other players to also contribute. This creates a more substantial common pool that can be exploited in later rounds, leading to higher free-riding opportunities than if everyone immediately defected.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (All other rounds):**
    *   In this main phase, the strategy dynamically adjusts its behavior based on the collective contributions of *other* players in the *previous* round.
    *   Let `sum_other_contributions_last_round` be the total number of contributions made by all players *other than yourself* in the immediately preceding round.
    *   Let `num_other_players = n_players - 1`.

    *   **Condition A: High Collective Contribution (Opportunity for Strong Free-Riding):**
        *   If `(sum_other_contributions_last_round / num_other_players) >= high_contribution_threshold_ratio`:
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** The other players are contributing significantly, ensuring a healthy common pool. This presents the prime opportunity to maximize personal gain by free-riding (keeping your endowment) while still benefiting from others' contributions.

    *   **Condition B: Critically Low Collective Contribution (Need to Revive the Pool):**
        *   Else if `(sum_other_contributions_last_round / num_other_players) < low_contribution_threshold_ratio`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** The common pool is dangerously low, diminishing the benefits of free-riding. A temporary, strategic contribution in this scenario is a calculated risk to "re-seed" cooperation. The aim is to incentivize other players to resume contributing, thereby rebuilding the exploitable resource for future rounds. This is a minimal investment to preserve long-term exploitation potential.

    *   **Condition C: Moderate Collective Contribution (Continue Free-Riding):**
        *   Else (i.e., `low_contribution_threshold_ratio <= (sum_other_contributions_last_round / num_other_players) < high_contribution_threshold_ratio`):
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** There is still a moderate level of contribution from others, sufficient enough to gain from without needing to contribute yourself. It is not critically low enough to warrant an intervention. The strategy continues to free-ride.

**Exploitative Mindset:**
This strategy is fundamentally exploitative. It prioritizes maximizing its own payoff by leveraging the contributions of others. It minimizes its own contributions, making them only when strategically necessary to cultivate or rescue an environment conducive to free-riding. It capitalizes on others' cooperation and ruthlessly defects when future interactions offer no incentive for generosity.

**Robustness and Edge Cases:**
*   **Single Round Game (r_total = 1):** `initial_cooperation_rounds` is 0. `end_game_start_round` is 1. The strategy immediately defects in round 1, which is the optimal single-round decision.
*   **Very Few Rounds (r_total <= 3):** `end_game_start_round` will be 1, causing the strategy to defect in all rounds, consistent with backward induction.
*   **Wide Range of Opponent Behaviors:**
    *   Against Always Defect (All D): The strategy will quickly transition to primarily defecting, minimizing its own losses.
    *   Against Always Cooperate (All C): The strategy will contribute initially, then free-ride for the majority of the game, leading to a high payoff for itself.
    *   Against Conditional Cooperators (e.g., Tit-for-Tat): The strategy will attempt to induce cooperation, then exploit it. If cooperation breaks down, it will try to re-seed it, leading to dynamic and adaptive play.

The following strategy, "The Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed for the Public Goods Game to be exploitative, adaptive, and robust. It prioritizes maximizing its own payoff by free-riding on others' contributions, only contributing strategically to maintain future exploitation opportunities, and fully exploiting in the endgame.

---

**Strategy Name: The Adaptive Free-Rider**

This strategy aims to maximize its individual payoff by consistently attempting to free-ride on the contributions of other players. It only contributes itself as a calculated, self-interested investment to prevent the complete collapse of the public good, which would eliminate future opportunities for exploitation.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for the public good (where `1 < k < n`).

**Internal Parameters:**
*   `COOPERATION_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.4`: This threshold represents the minimum average contribution rate from other players (excluding this strategy) that "The Adaptive Free-Rider" desires to maintain. If the observed average cooperation falls at or below this level, the strategy considers a temporary contribution to stimulate cooperation.
*   `DEFECTION_PUNISHMENT_WINDOW = 3`: This specifies the number of most recent rounds to consider when calculating the `average_other_cooperation_rate`. Using a window makes the strategy robust to single-round fluctuations in opponent behavior.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initialization Phase):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** The strategy begins by immediately attempting to free-ride. This establishes an exploitative baseline and tests the initial cooperativeness of other players without incurring any cost.

2.  **Rounds 2 to (r - 2) (Adaptive Exploitation Phase):**
    *   At the beginning of each of these rounds, the strategy assesses the recent behavior of all *other* players.
    *   **Calculate `average_other_cooperation_rate`:**
        *   Determine `effective_window_size = min(current_round - 1, DEFECTION_PUNISHMENT_WINDOW)`. This ensures that for early rounds (where `current_round - 1` is less than `DEFECTION_PUNISHMENT_WINDOW`), all available past rounds are considered.
        *   Sum the contributions of all players *other than self* for each of the `effective_window_size` most recent rounds (i.e., from `current_round - 1` backwards).
        *   `average_other_cooperation_rate = (Total contributions by all other players in the last effective_window_size rounds) / ((n - 1) * effective_window_size)`.

    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `average_other_cooperation_rate` is strictly greater than `COOPERATION_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).** Other players are contributing sufficiently, creating a robust public good for the strategy to free-ride upon. The strategy continues its primary goal of exploitation.
        *   **Else (if `average_other_cooperation_rate` is at or below `COOPERATION_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD`):**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).** The collective contribution by others is declining or too low, threatening the viability of the public good. To prevent its complete collapse and to potentially encourage other players to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds (thereby restoring future exploitation opportunities), the strategy makes a temporary, strategic contribution. This is a calculated investment to maintain a baseline of cooperation that is beneficial for future free-riding, not an act of genuine cooperation.

3.  **Rounds (r - 1) and r (Endgame Phase):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** As the game approaches its final rounds, the 'shadow of the future' diminishes significantly. There is no longer any incentive to maintain cooperation for future rounds, as no future rounds exist (or are immediately followed by guaranteed defection from all rational players). The strategy will consistently defect in these final rounds to maximize immediate individual gain, regardless of past actions or the current state of the public good.

**Rationale for Exploitative Mindset:**
*   **Default Defection:** The strategy's default action in the first round and during periods of sufficient cooperation is to defect, clearly demonstrating a preference for free-riding.
*   **Strategic Contribution:** Contributions are not made out of reciprocity or a desire for collective welfare, but purely as a calculated "investment" to prevent the public good from collapsing. This action is taken only when the strategy's own long-term free-riding potential is threatened by insufficient contributions from others. It's an attempt to "re-seed" the public good for future exploitation.
*   **Endgame Exploitation:** Guaranteed defection in the final rounds leverages the breakdown of future incentives, ensuring maximum selfish gain when there are no repercussions.
*   **Adaptability:** The strategy dynamically assesses the average cooperation level of opponents, allowing it to adapt to varying degrees of cooperativeness in the player pool. It aims to identify and benefit from cooperative players while minimizing its own cost, adapting to maintain a sufficient pool of contributions to exploit.

It's robust to varying opponent strategies by continuously adjusting its tolerance for low contributions from others.

**Strategy Name:** The Adaptive Predator

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Internal State Variables:**
*   `Exploitation_Threshold (ET)`: A floating-point value between 0 and 1. This threshold represents the *minimum average contribution rate from other players* required for me to decide to **Defect** in the current round. If the average contribution from others in the previous round falls *below* this threshold, I will **Contribute**.
    *   **Initial Value:** `ET = 0.3` (Meaning, initially, if less than 30% of other players contributed last round, I will contribute).
    *   **Boundary Values:** `ET_Min = 0.1`, `ET_Max = 0.7` (To prevent the threshold from becoming too extreme).
    *   **Adjustment Step:** `ET_Adjustment_Step = 0.05`

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1:**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   *Rationale:* This is a strategic opening move. By contributing in the first round, I signal a willingness to cooperate to conditional cooperators, encouraging them to also contribute. This establishes an initial pool of public good for future exploitation and prevents an immediate collapse into mutual defection.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Exploitation Phase):**
    *   **Observation:** At the beginning of round `t` (for `t` from 2 to `r-1`), observe the actions of all players from the preceding round `t-1`.
    *   **Calculate Others' Average Contribution:**
        *   Calculate `total_other_contributions_last_round = sum_{j != self} c_j_{t-1}` (the sum of contributions by all players *other than myself* in round `t-1`).
        *   Calculate `average_other_contributions_last_round = total_other_contributions_last_round / (n - 1)`.
    *   **Decision:**
        *   **If `average_other_contributions_last_round >= Exploitation_Threshold`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* The other players are contributing sufficiently (at or above my tolerance threshold). It's an opportune moment to free-ride and maximize my individual payoff without jeopardizing the public good too much.
        *   **Else (`average_other_contributions_last_round < Exploitation_Threshold`):**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   *Rationale:* The average contribution from others has fallen below my acceptable threshold. The public good pool is in danger of collapsing. I make a strategic contribution to try and "revive" cooperation, signal my willingness to re-engage, and prevent the system from drying up completely, thus preserving future opportunities for exploitation.

    *   **Adaptive Adjustment of `Exploitation_Threshold` (ET):**
        *   *After* my action `c_i_t` is made for round `t` (and `others_avg_contribution_in_t` becomes known for round `t`), I adjust my `Exploitation_Threshold` for the *next* round `t+1` as follows:
        *   Let `my_action_t` be my chosen action (C or D) for the current round `t`.
        *   Let `others_avg_contribution_t` be the actual average contribution of other players in the current round `t`.

        *   **If `my_action_t == D` (I Defected in round `t`):**
            *   **If `others_avg_contribution_t >= Exploitation_Threshold` (my defection didn't cause others to drop below my tolerance, or they were already above it):**
                *   *Adjustment:* My defection was successful or tolerated. I can afford to be **more demanding** of others before I contribute again.
                *   `Exploitation_Threshold = min(ET_Max, Exploitation_Threshold + ET_Adjustment_Step)`
            *   **Else (`others_avg_contribution_t < Exploitation_Threshold`):**
                *   *Adjustment:* My defection (or the general trend) pushed others below my acceptable tolerance. I need to be **less demanding** (more willing to contribute myself) to help revive the pool.
                *   `Exploitation_Threshold = max(ET_Min, Exploitation_Threshold - ET_Adjustment_Step)`

        *   **If `my_action_t == C` (I Contributed in round `t`):**
            *   **If `others_avg_contribution_t >= Exploitation_Threshold` (my contribution helped raise others' contributions above my tolerance, or they were already there):**
                *   *Adjustment:* My contribution was effective. I can now try to free-ride more. I can afford to be **more demanding** of others.
                *   `Exploitation_Threshold = min(ET_Max, Exploitation_Threshold + ET_Adjustment_Step)`
            *   **Else (`others_avg_contribution_t < Exploitation_Threshold`):**
                *   *Adjustment:* My contribution did not successfully raise others' contributions above my tolerance. I need to be **more persistent** in my efforts to revive the pool.
                *   `Exploitation_Threshold = max(ET_Min, Exploitation_Threshold - ET_Adjustment_Step)`

3.  **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. The dominant strategy of defection applies without any long-term consequences, allowing me to free-ride on any existing contributions one last time.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_74 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to be highly exploitative by defaulting to defection to maximize immediate gains, while strategically making calculated contributions only when necessary to prevent a complete collapse of cooperation that would eliminate future free-riding opportunities. It is adaptive to the number of players and the multiplier, and robust against various opponent behaviors, ensuring it never becomes a lone cooperator (a "sucker").

---

**Strategy Name:** The Adaptive Free-Rider

**Core Principle:** Prioritize immediate self-interest by free-riding on others' contributions. Only contribute when the level of cooperation from others falls critically low, threatening the existence of a public good worth exploiting, and only if there's still some cooperation to build upon. Never become the sole contributor.

**Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `k`: Multiplier for the shared pot (`1 < k < n`).
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.

**Derived Parameter: `Cooperation_Revival_Threshold` (CRT)**
This threshold represents the minimum number of *other players* who must have contributed in the *previous round* to trigger my own contribution in the current round. It's a calculated attempt to stabilize faltering cooperation without being overly generous.

`Cooperation_Revival_Threshold = max(1, floor( (n-1) * (1 - k/n) ))`

*   **Rationale for CRT:**
    *   `1 - k/n` reflects the individual incentive to defect. A higher value means the public good is less efficient from an individual perspective, requiring more collective contributions to make free-riding attractive.
    *   Multiplying by `(n-1)` scales this to the number of other players.
    *   `floor()` ensures an integer number of cooperators.
    *   `max(1, ...)` ensures the threshold is never zero. This is crucial because if `Cooperation_Revival_Threshold` were 0, I might contribute when no one else is, which is against the exploitative principle of avoiding the "sucker's payoff."

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** Start by maximizing immediate payoff and testing the opponents' initial willingness to cooperate. If others cooperate, I immediately free-ride. If they all defect, I lose nothing.

2.  **Last Round (`r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for my actions. Defecting is the dominant strategy in a single round, so I maximize my payoff.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`t` from 2 to `r-1`):**
    *   **Observation:** At the start of round `t`, observe the actions of all players in the *previous round (`t-1`)*. Count the total number of contributions made by *other players* (excluding myself) in round `t-1`. Let this be `C_other_last`.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `C_other_last == 0`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reasoning:** No other player contributed in the previous round. The system has completely collapsed, or no one is willing to cooperate. My individual contribution would yield a payoff of `k/n`, which is less than 1 (the payoff from defecting when others also defect). Contributing alone is the "sucker's payoff" and contradicts the exploitative mindset.
        *   **Else if `C_other_last < Cooperation_Revival_Threshold`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Reasoning:** Others are cooperating, but the level of cooperation is critically low, falling below the `Cooperation_Revival_Threshold`. This indicates the public good is threatened and might collapse completely (moving towards `C_other_last == 0`). My contribution here is a calculated strategic "investment" to "prime the pump" or signal a willingness to stabilize cooperation, hoping to induce others to contribute more in subsequent rounds, allowing me to resume free-riding. This is a last-resort effort to prevent the source of free-riding (the public good itself) from disappearing.
        *   **Else (`C_other_last >= Cooperation_Revival_Threshold`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reasoning:** Other players are cooperating at a sufficient level (at or above the `Cooperation_Revival_Threshold`). The public good is healthy enough for me to continue free-riding without jeopardizing its existence. I maximize my immediate payoff by defecting.

---

**Exploitative Alignment:**
*   **Default Defection:** The strategy defaults to defecting in the first and last rounds, and whenever there is sufficient cooperation from others.
*   **Conditional Contribution:** Contributions are only made under specific, calculated conditions where the system's overall cooperation is deemed too low, and it serves as a calculated "investment" to sustain a pool that can be exploited later.
*   **Avoids Sucker's Payoff:** Crucially, it never contributes if no other player has contributed, ensuring it doesn't become the sole contributor in a game of defectors.
*   **Adaptive Threshold:** The `Cooperation_Revival_Threshold` dynamically adjusts based on game parameters (`n` and `k`), allowing the strategy to be more or less sensitive to declining cooperation depending on how efficient the public good is.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_75 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Predator," is designed to maximize individual payoff by strategically exploiting cooperative tendencies in opponents while minimizing personal contributions when cooperation is weak or absent. It is adaptive to observed opponent behavior and robust against various playstyles, always prioritizing self-interest.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: number of players
*   `r`: total number of rounds
*   `k`: multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Internal State:**
*   `history`: A record of all players' past actions (contributions: `c_j` for all `j`) from which `P_others` values are derived.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **If `r = 1` (Single Round Game):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**. In a single-round game, individual defection is the dominant strategy and always yields the highest immediate payoff. There is no future to influence.

2.  **Initial Assessment Phase (Current Round `t` from 1 to `Min(3, r-1)`):**
    *   **Round 1:**
        *   **Action: Cooperate (C)**. This serves as an initial "probe" or "bait." It signals a willingness to cooperate, potentially encouraging conditional cooperators among opponents to also contribute. This initial investment is small but gathers crucial data.
    *   **Rounds 2 and `Min(3, r-1)` (if `r > 1`):**
        *   Calculate `P_others_prev = (sum of contributions by all other players in round `t-1`) / (n - 1)`.
        *   If `P_others_prev >= 0.5`:
            *   **Action: Cooperate (C)**. If a substantial portion of others responded cooperatively to the initial probe, continue to signal cooperation for a short period. This aims to reinforce a positive cooperative cycle, encouraging sustained contributions from others for future exploitation.
        *   Else (`P_others_prev < 0.5`):
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**. If the initial probe did not yield significant cooperation, further "investment" in cooperation is unlikely to be reciprocated and would only incur a direct loss. Revert to defection.

3.  **Exploitation Phase (Current Round `t` from `Min(3, r-1)+1` to `r-1`):**
    *   Calculate `P_others_recent_avg = (average proportion of cooperation by all other players over the *last 3 rounds*)`. (If fewer than 3 rounds are available since the start of this phase, average over available rounds within this phase).
    *   **If `P_others_recent_avg >= 0.6`:**
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**. This indicates that other players are maintaining a strong and consistent level of cooperation. This is the prime opportunity for exploitation: free-ride on their contributions to maximize individual payoff while incurring no personal cost. My contribution is not needed to maintain such a high level of group cooperation, and it would directly reduce my profit.
    *   **Else (`P_others_recent_avg < 0.6`):**
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**. If cooperation among others is not consistently high, or if it is declining, contributing would result in a direct individual loss (`1 - k/n`) with uncertain and likely insufficient returns from the common pool. Defect to minimize individual costs. This also signals that I will not contribute if others are not providing a substantial common good, potentially encouraging others to increase their contributions if they wish to maintain a common pool.

4.  **Final Round (`r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**. With no future rounds to influence, the dominant strategy of defection maximizes the immediate and final payoff, consistent with backward induction.

---

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Strategic Baiting:** A very limited initial cooperation is used solely to identify and encourage conditional cooperators for future exploitation. It's a calculated, low-cost investment with a short expiration date, designed to create free-riding opportunities.
*   **Aggressive Free-Riding:** When a sufficient and sustained level of cooperation is observed among others, the strategy immediately switches to defection to maximize personal gain without contributing to the common pool.
*   **Loss Minimization:** When cooperation is weak or absent, or if the "bait" phase fails, the strategy defaults to defection. This prevents any personal losses from contributing (`1 - k/n`), ensuring it defaults to the highest individual payoff available in a low-cooperation environment (i.e., keeping the initial 1 token).
*   **No Altruism or Reciprocity for Defection:** The strategy does not "punish" individual defectors through reciprocal defection if the overall average of others is still high. It only cares about the *opportunity* to free-ride. It will defect if the conditions for exploitation are met, regardless of individual past actions of others, as long as the overall pool is good.
*   **Backward Induction:** Optimal play in the final round to ensure maximum terminal payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_76 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to be highly exploitative by maximizing its own payoff. It aims to free-ride on the contributions of others as much as possible, only contributing strategically when necessary to maintain an environment conducive to future exploitation, and aggressively defecting when there's no incentive for future cooperation.

---

**Strategy Name: The Adaptive Free-Rider**

This strategy operates by constantly assessing the cooperative behavior of other players and adjusting its actions to secure the highest personal gain. Its core principle is to default to defection unless a strategic reason to contribute emerges, always prioritizing self-interest.

**Parameters:**
*   `T_cooperation = 0.5`: This is the threshold for the average contribution rate of other players. If the average is at or above this, the strategy considers cooperation to be sufficient.
*   `N_endgame_rounds = 2`: This is the number of final rounds in the game where the strategy will unconditionally defect.

**Decision Rules (for player i):**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a calculated, small investment. By initiating with a contribution, the Adaptive Free-Rider attempts to "prime the pump" and signal potential cooperation to responsive opponent strategies (e.g., those following Tit-for-Tat or Grim Trigger). The goal is to encourage a baseline level of cooperation from others in subsequent rounds, thereby creating an exploitable environment for the Adaptive Free-Rider.

2.  **Endgame Rounds (Rounds `r - N_endgame_rounds + 1` to `r`):**
    *   **Condition:** If the `current_round` is within the last `N_endgame_rounds` of the game (i.e., `current_round >= r - N_endgame_rounds + 1`).
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final rounds of a repeated game, the incentive for future reciprocation disappears. This leads to the well-known backward induction effect where cooperation unravels. The Adaptive Free-Rider exploits this by defecting unconditionally, maximizing its payoff in these rounds without concern for any future consequences. This also handles very short games (e.g., `r=1` or `r=2`) by defecting from the start.

3.  **Mid-Game Adaptive Exploitation (Rounds 2 to `r - N_endgame_rounds`):**
    *   In these rounds, the strategy observes the behavior of other players from the *previous* round.
    *   Let `C_others_previous_round` be the sum of contributions from all *other* `(n-1)` players in the immediately preceding round (`current_round - 1`).
    *   Calculate `Avg_C_others_previous_round = C_others_previous_round / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Scenario A: Sufficient Cooperation Detected**
        *   **Condition:** If `Avg_C_others_previous_round >= T_cooperation`.
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Reasoning:** If other players are contributing at a sufficiently high level, the Adaptive Free-Rider seizes the opportunity to free-ride. This is the primary exploitative action, maximizing immediate personal payoff by benefiting from others' contributions without incurring the cost of its own.

    *   **Scenario B: Declining but Present Cooperation**
        *   **Condition:** If `0 < Avg_C_others_previous_round < T_cooperation`.
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   **Reasoning:** If cooperation from others is declining but not entirely absent, the strategy makes a calculated, temporary investment. This one-round contribution acts as a "repair" mechanism, signaling a willingness to cooperate to responsive players. The aim is to prevent a complete collapse of contributions and encourage other players to resume cooperating, thereby maintaining a profitable "ecosystem" for the Adaptive Free-Rider to exploit in subsequent rounds.

    *   **Scenario C: No Cooperation from Others**
        *   **Condition:** If `Avg_C_others_previous_round == 0`.
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Reasoning:** If no other players contributed in the previous round, the collective environment is entirely uncooperative. In this scenario, contributing would be a pure loss for the Adaptive Free-Rider without any reasonable prospect of inducing future cooperation. Thus, it protects its endowment by defecting.

---

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Default Free-Riding:** The strategy's default action in the mid-game is to defect whenever there's sufficient cooperation from others (Scenario A).
*   **Strategic Investment:** The initial contribution (Round 1) and mid-game contributions (Scenario B) are not altruistic. They are carefully calculated investments designed to *cultivate* or *restore* a cooperative environment from which the strategy can then free-ride.
*   **Endgame Harvesting:** The unconditional defection in the final rounds is a direct exploitation of the game's finite horizon, maximizing final payouts without any future repercussions.
*   **Self-Protection:** The strategy never allows itself to be a "sucker" by contributing when there is no hope of benefit (Scenario C).

This Adaptive Free-Rider strategy is robust to various opponent behaviors because it constantly adapts to the observed level of cooperation, rather than assuming fixed opponent types. It is designed to navigate the tension between individual and collective incentives by consistently leaning towards individual gain while strategically manipulating the collective dynamics.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_77 = '''
This strategy, named **"Adaptive Predator"**, aims to maximize individual payoff by primarily exploiting the contributions of others. It employs a default defection policy, strategically contributes only when the public good pool is completely depleted to "bait" new contributions, and ruthlessly defects in the endgame.

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Predator**

**Goal:** Maximize own payoff by leveraging others' contributions while minimizing own contributions. Adapt by temporarily seeding cooperation only when the collective pool is empty, and immediately revert to exploitation once contributions resume or attempts to revive the pool prove futile.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Internal State Variables:**
*   `consecutive_zero_contributions_count`: An integer counter, initialized to 0. This tracks how many consecutive rounds have passed where `total_contributions` (from all players, including self) was 0.
*   `test_contribution_limit`: A threshold for the number of times the strategy is willing to "test" for cooperation by contributing when the pool is empty. Set to `3`. (This value can be tuned, but 3 offers a reasonable balance between persistence and avoiding being a perpetual sucker).
*   `endgame_defection_rounds`: The number of final rounds during which the strategy will always defect, regardless of history. Set to `2` (i.e., rounds `r-1` and `r`).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1:**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* Start by maximizing immediate payoff and testing the willingness of others to contribute without any prior commitment.

2.  **Endgame Phase (if `current_round > r - endgame_defection_rounds`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final rounds, there are no future interactions to consider. The individually rational and exploitative choice is to defect to maximize the current round's payoff, as any contribution would be a pure loss without potential future benefits. Reset `consecutive_zero_contributions_count` as pool revival is irrelevant.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (Main Logic - for `current_round` from 2 up to `r - endgame_defection_rounds`):**

    *   **Observe `total_contributions_prev`:** This is the sum of contributions from all players in the previous round (`current_round - 1`).

    *   **Update `consecutive_zero_contributions_count`:**
        *   If `total_contributions_prev == 0`: Increment `consecutive_zero_contributions_count`.
        *   Else (`total_contributions_prev > 0`): Reset `consecutive_zero_contributions_count = 0`. (Any contribution, even if it's only your own from a previous "test," indicates a non-zero public good, which prevents further "testing" for now).

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `total_contributions_prev > 0`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* The public good pool is not empty. Exploit any existing contributions by defecting to maximize individual gain. This is the primary mode of exploitation.

        *   **Else (`total_contributions_prev == 0`):**
            *   The public good pool is completely depleted (everyone defected in the previous round).
            *   **If `consecutive_zero_contributions_count <= test_contribution_limit`:**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                *   *Rationale:* This is a strategic "test" or "bait" contribution. The strategy is willing to temporarily incur a cost of 1 token to try and revive cooperation among other players. The hope is that this single contribution might encourage conditional cooperators to re-engage, creating a public good that can be exploited in future rounds.
            *   **Else (`consecutive_zero_contributions_count > test_contribution_limit`):**
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Rationale:* Repeated attempts to revive the public good pool have failed. The strategy ceases its "testing" contributions to avoid being a perpetual "sucker" and minimizes further losses. It assumes the game will remain in a state of universal defection for the remainder of the intermediate rounds.

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Default Defection:** The strategy defaults to defection whenever there is any public good to exploit, directly capitalizing on others' contributions.
*   **Strategic "Baiting":** Contributions are not made out of altruism but as a calculated risk to encourage others to contribute, thus creating a larger pool for future exploitation. It's a "bait and switch" approach.
*   **Limited Risk:** The `test_contribution_limit` prevents the strategy from continuously contributing into a non-responsive environment, ensuring it doesn't become the exploited party.
*   **Endgame Defection:** Eliminates any possibility of contributing when there's no future benefit to be gained, maximizing terminal payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_78 = '''
This strategy, named the "Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to maximize individual payoff by strategically exploiting other players' contributions while maintaining a sufficient level of collective cooperation to free-ride upon. It is adaptive to opponent behaviors and robust across varying game parameters.

**Strategy Name:** The Adaptive Free-Rider

**Internal Parameters:**
*   `LURE_ROUNDS = 2`: The number of initial rounds to contribute. This is an investment to encourage cooperation among other players.
*   `EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD = 0.6`: A threshold representing the average contribution level of other players in the previous round. If this threshold is met or exceeded, the strategy will defect to free-ride.

**Decision Rules:**

**1. Lure Phase (Rounds 1 to `LURE_ROUNDS`)**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
    *   **Rationale:** In these initial rounds, the strategy contributes to the public good. This is an investment to signal a willingness to cooperate and encourage other players to contribute. The goal is to establish a base level of contributions that can be exploited in later rounds.

**2. Exploit and Maintain Phase (Rounds `LURE_ROUNDS + 1` to `r - 1`)**
    *   At the beginning of each round `t` in this phase, the strategy evaluates the collective behavior of other players from the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculate `Avg_Others_Contribution_Prev`:** This is the average contribution of all other `n-1` players in round `t-1`.
        `Avg_Others_Contribution_Prev = (Sum of contributions c_j for all j ≠ self in round t-1) / (n - 1)`
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `Avg_Others_Contribution_Prev >= EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**
            *   **Rationale:** A significant portion of other players are contributing. This represents a prime opportunity for free-riding. By defecting, the strategy keeps its personal endowment (worth 1 token) while still benefiting from the large pool of contributions from others, thus maximizing immediate payoff.
        *   **Else (if `Avg_Others_Contribution_Prev < EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`):**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   **Rationale:** The collective contribution level from others is too low, indicating a potential breakdown of cooperation or insufficient resources for effective free-riding. In this scenario, contributing is a strategic "re-lure" or "maintenance" investment. It aims to prevent a complete collapse of the public good, encourage other players to increase their contributions, and re-establish a more exploitable environment for future rounds.

**3. Final Round Phase (Round `r`)**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D)
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no subsequent interactions. Therefore, there is no incentive to influence future player behavior. The single-round dominant strategy of defection applies, as it maximizes payoff without any future repercussions.

**Edge Cases Handled:**
*   **`r = 1` (Single Round Game):** If `r=1`, the `LURE_ROUNDS` phase and `Exploit and Maintain` phase are effectively skipped. The strategy defaults directly to the `Final Round Phase`, resulting in a Defect (D) action, which is the Nash Equilibrium for a single-round PGG.
*   **`r = 2`:** `LURE_ROUNDS` (R1=C, R2=C) would mean R2 is a lure round. But R2 is the final round. In this case, R1 will be C. R2 will be handled by the Final Round Phase and be D. So R1=C, R2=D. This seems appropriate for an exploitative strategy. (My `LURE_ROUNDS` is `2`. So Round 1 -> C, Round 2 -> C. Then it hits the final round logic for R2. So this needs to be `LURE_ROUNDS = min(r-1, 2)` or similar to avoid "final round of Lure" ambiguity. For clarity: R1 is Lure. R2 is Lure. If r=2, R2 is *also* final. The final round rule should take precedence. The description above already implies this by stating "Rounds `LURE_ROUNDS + 1` to `r-1`" and "Round `r` (Final Round)".
    *   Let's clarify: The "Final Round Phase" takes precedence over any other phase if `current_round == r`.

**Clarification for Precedence:**
The phases are ordered by priority for a given round `t`:
1.  If `t == r` (current round is the final round): Apply "Final Round Phase" rules.
2.  Else if `t <= LURE_ROUNDS`: Apply "Lure Phase" rules.
3.  Else (`t > LURE_ROUNDS` and `t < r`): Apply "Exploit and Maintain Phase" rules.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_79 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Free-Rider with Calculated Inducement," is designed to be highly exploitative in a repeated Public Goods Game. Its primary goal is to maximize its own payoff by free-riding on the contributions of other players. It will strategically defect by default, only contributing when absolutely necessary to prevent the public good from collapsing to a level where free-riding becomes unprofitable, or to attempt to re-establish a minimal level of contributions from others. This is a calculated, self-interested contribution, not an act of cooperation or altruism.

**Game Parameters Used for Strategy Constants:**
The strategy initializes internal constants based on the game parameters provided:
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions.

**Internal State Variable (reset at the start of each game):**
*   `cooperation_induction_counter`: An integer counter, initialized to 0. This tracks how many consecutive rounds the strategy is committed to contributing after detecting a collapse risk.

**Constants/Thresholds (calculated once at the start of the game):**
*   `exploitation_threshold_low`: This proportion (between 0.1 and 0.7) represents the minimum acceptable contribution rate from other players to justify continued free-riding. If the observed contribution rate from others falls below this, the strategy considers inducing cooperation.
    *   Calculated as: `Max(0.1, Min(0.7, 0.5 * (k / n) + 0.1))`
    *   *Justification:* This threshold adapts to the value of the public good. A higher `k/n` (more valuable public good) means the strategy demands a higher contribution rate from others before it's comfortable free-riding, indicating it's willing to step in sooner to protect a more valuable public pool.
*   `cooperation_induction_duration`: This is the number of rounds the strategy commits to contributing after deciding to induce cooperation.
    *   Calculated as: `Max(1, Min(3, Floor(r / 5)))`
    *   *Justification:* The duration adapts to the total game length. For shorter games, a shorter induction period (e.g., 1 round) is appropriate. For longer games, a slightly longer period (e.g., 2-3 rounds) might be more effective in re-establishing contributions.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round `r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Decision:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation or punish defection. The individually rational choice is to free-ride, maximizing immediate payoff without future consequences.

2.  **Round 1:**
    *   **Decision:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Reasoning:** The strategy starts by immediately free-riding to test the willingness of others to contribute without personal cost. This establishes an exploitative stance from the outset. The `cooperation_induction_counter` remains 0.

3.  **Rounds 2 to `r-1` (Adaptive Phase):**
    *   **Observe History:** At the beginning of the current round `t`, the strategy observes the actions of all other `n-1` players in the *previous* round (`t-1`).
    *   Calculate `total_other_contributions_prev_round = sum_{j!=i} c_j` (where `c_j` is player `j`'s contribution in round `t-1` and `j != i`).
    *   Calculate `proportion_other_contributors_prev_round = total_other_contributions_prev_round / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Decision Logic:**

        *   **If `cooperation_induction_counter > 0`:**
            *   **Decision:** Contribute (1 token).
            *   **Action:** Decrement `cooperation_induction_counter` by 1.
            *   **Reasoning:** The strategy is currently executing a pre-committed "cooperation induction" phase, aimed at signaling a temporary willingness to contribute to re-establish contributions from others. It fulfills its commitment.

        *   **Else (`cooperation_induction_counter == 0`):**
            *   **Check for Collapse Risk:** If `proportion_other_contributors_prev_round < exploitation_threshold_low`:
                *   **Decision:** Contribute (1 token).
                *   **Action:** Set `cooperation_induction_counter = cooperation_induction_duration - 1`. (The current contribution counts as the first round of the induction duration, so `cooperation_induction_duration - 1` more rounds are needed).
                *   **Reasoning:** The level of contributions from others is critically low, threatening the viability of the public good pool from which the strategy seeks to free-ride. This is a calculated, self-serving contribution to prevent a total collapse and attempt to restore a profitable free-riding environment. It's a temporary investment to ensure future free-riding opportunities.

            *   **Else (`proportion_other_contributors_prev_round >= exploitation_threshold_low`):**
                *   **Decision:** Defect (contribute 0 tokens).
                *   **Reasoning:** Others are contributing a sufficient amount for the strategy to continue free-riding profitably without contributing itself. This maximizes immediate payoff, as there is no current threat to the public good's viability that requires intervention.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_80 = '''
This strategy, named "The Conditional Exploiter," is designed to maximize individual payoff in the Public Goods Game by strategically leveraging the cooperative behavior of other players while minimizing its own contributions. It adaptively responds to the collective behavior of the group, attempting to stimulate contributions when they drop too low, only to revert to free-riding when cooperation is sufficient.

---

### Strategy Name: The Conditional Exploiter

**Game Parameters (Input to the strategy):**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for the common pool.

**Internal Strategy Parameters:**
These parameters are fixed for this strategy description but would be tunable in a real-world implementation to optimize performance against varying opponent pools.

*   `OBSERVATION_WINDOW = 3`: The number of past rounds to consider when calculating the average contribution rate of other players. This allows for adaptive responses to recent behavior.
*   `COOPERATION_THRESHOLD = 0.6`: If the average contribution rate of *other players* falls below this threshold, the strategy will initiate a "lure" sequence to encourage more contributions. Otherwise, it will exploit.
*   `LURE_DURATION = 2`: The number of consecutive rounds the strategy will contribute when it initiates a "lure" sequence. This is a short-term investment to attempt to boost collective cooperation.
*   `END_GAME_DEFECT_ROUNDS = 2`: The number of final rounds in the game where the strategy will unconditionally defect. This accounts for the well-known "end-game effect" in repeated games.

**Internal State Variables:**
These variables track the strategy's current operational mode and history.

*   `current_round`: Tracks the current round number (from 1 to `r`).
*   `lure_in_progress`: A boolean flag, `True` if the strategy is currently executing a "lure" sequence (i.e., contributing to encourage others), `False` otherwise.
*   `lure_rounds_remaining`: An integer, counting down the number of rounds left in the current "lure" sequence.

---

### Decision Rules (When to Contribute (C) vs. Defect (D)):

The strategy evaluates its action at the beginning of each round, following a hierarchical set of rules:

1.  **End Game Logic:**
    *   If `current_round > r - END_GAME_DEFECT_ROUNDS`:
        *   **Action: Defect (D).**
        *   *Reasoning:* In the final rounds, the "shadow of the future" is gone, and there is no incentive to foster future cooperation. Defection is the dominant strategy to maximize immediate payoff.

2.  **Lure in Progress Logic:**
    *   Else if `lure_in_progress` is `True`:
        *   If `lure_rounds_remaining > 0`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   Decrement `lure_rounds_remaining` by 1.
            *   *Reasoning:* Continue the planned "lure" sequence to encourage other players' contributions.
        *   Else (`lure_rounds_remaining == 0`):
            *   Set `lure_in_progress = False`.
            *   Proceed to **Adaptive Exploitation Logic** for the current round (the lure sequence has just concluded).
            *   *Reasoning:* The lure sequence has completed. The strategy now re-evaluates the group's cooperation level.

3.  **Initial Probe Logic (Round 1 only, if not caught by End Game):**
    *   Else if `current_round == 1`:
        *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
        *   *Reasoning:* Start with a single contribution as an initial "probe" or "bait." This signals a willingness to cooperate, potentially triggering cooperation from others that can then be exploited.

4.  **Adaptive Exploitation Logic (General Case):**
    *   (This applies if none of the above conditions were met, meaning it's not the end game, not actively luring, and not Round 1).

    a.  **Calculate Average Other-Player Contribution Rate:**
        *   Access the game history to find contributions of all *other players* in the past `OBSERVATION_WINDOW` rounds (or fewer if `current_round - 1 < OBSERVATION_WINDOW`).
        *   `total_other_contributions_in_window = sum of (all other players' contributions in the relevant past rounds)`.
        *   `rounds_considered = min(current_round - 1, OBSERVATION_WINDOW)`.
        *   `max_possible_contributions = (n - 1) * rounds_considered`.
        *   `current_avg_other_c_rate = total_other_contributions_in_window / max_possible_contributions` (if `max_possible_contributions > 0`, else `0`).

    b.  **Decision Based on Observed Rate:**
        *   If `current_avg_other_c_rate >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Reasoning:* Other players are contributing sufficiently. Exploit this cooperation by defecting, maximizing personal gain while benefiting from their contributions to the common pool.
        *   Else (`current_avg_other_c_rate < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   Set `lure_in_progress = True`.
            *   Set `lure_rounds_remaining = LURE_DURATION - 1`. (The current contribution is the first round of the lure).
            *   *Reasoning:* The collective cooperation level has dropped too low. Initiate a "lure" sequence to attempt to re-establish or increase contributions from other players, making the shared pool more valuable for future exploitation.

---

### Exploitative Alignment:

This strategy is inherently exploitative because:
*   **Default Exploitation:** Its primary mode of operation is to Defect when others are contributing above a satisfactory level, directly benefiting from their contributions without reciprocation.
*   **Active Manipulation:** The "lure" mechanism is a calculated, short-term investment (contributing for `LURE_DURATION` rounds) designed to manipulate the group into contributing more. The objective is not genuine cooperation but to increase the collective pool so that the strategy can then switch back to defecting and extract greater value from it.
*   **Self-Serving Rationality:** Every contribution decision is made with the ultimate goal of maximizing the strategy's own long-term payoff, even if it means sacrificing a small immediate gain to induce greater gains later from others.
*   **End-Game Betrayal:** Unconditionally defecting in the final rounds is a clear act of exploitation, shedding any pretense of cooperation once the potential for future interaction is gone.

This strategy is adaptive because it constantly monitors and responds to the collective behavior of other players, and it is robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors by having distinct responses to highly cooperative, non-cooperative, and conditionally cooperative groups.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_81 = '''
This strategy, named "The Strategic Opportunist," is designed to be highly exploitative by primarily free-riding on others' contributions. It adaptively attempts to re-establish cooperation if the public good collapses, but only for a limited number of "probes" before resorting to permanent defection, thus ensuring robustness against universally uncooperative environments.

**Strategy Parameters:**

*   `r_endgame_defection_horizon`: Number of final rounds to always defect (e.g., set to 2). This ensures defection in the last `X` rounds based on backward induction.
*   `cooperation_defection_threshold`: A proportion (0.0 to 1.0) representing the minimum average contribution rate of *other* players in the previous round that will trigger immediate defection from me (e.g., set to 0.5, meaning if 50% or more of other players contributed, I defect).
*   `probe_length`: The number of consecutive rounds I will contribute when initiating a "probe" to encourage cooperation (e.g., set to 2).
*   `max_failed_probes`: The maximum number of consecutive `probe_length`-round probes I will initiate if previous probes failed to raise `Avg_C_Rate_others` above the `cooperation_defection_threshold` (e.g., set to 2).

**Internal State Variables (Persist across rounds):**

*   `current_round_number`: Tracks the current round (starts at 1).
*   `my_last_action_was_probe`: Boolean, `True` if my last action was part of a multi-round probe sequence.
*   `probe_rounds_left`: Integer, counts down remaining rounds if `my_last_action_was_probe` is `True`.
*   `consecutive_failed_probes`: Integer, counts how many `probe_length`-round probes have been initiated without successfully raising the average cooperation rate of others above the `cooperation_defection_threshold`.

---

**Decision Rules (Executed at the start of each round):**

1.  **Initialization (Before Round 1):**
    *   Set `my_last_action_was_probe = False`
    *   Set `probe_rounds_left = 0`
    *   Set `consecutive_failed_probes = 0`

2.  **Per Round Logic:**

    *   Increment `current_round_number`.

    *   **A. Endgame Phase:**
        *   **Condition:** If `current_round_number > r - r_endgame_defection_horizon` (e.g., if `r=10` and `r_endgame_defection_horizon=2`, this applies to rounds 9 and 10).
        *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
        *   **Rationale:** Based on backward induction, there is no future to incentivize cooperation. Maximizing immediate payoff is the dominant strategy in the final rounds. All probe-related state variables are reset as they are no longer relevant.
        *   *After this action, the decision for the current round is complete.*

    *   **B. Probe in Progress:**
        *   **Condition:** If `my_last_action_was_probe` is `True`.
        *   **Sub-Condition 1:** If `probe_rounds_left > 0`.
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   Decrement `probe_rounds_left` by 1.
            *   **Rationale:** Continue the pre-planned contribution sequence to encourage others, fulfilling the commitment of the probe.
            *   *After this action, the decision for the current round is complete.*
        *   **Sub-Condition 2:** If `probe_rounds_left == 0`.
            *   **Action:** Set `my_last_action_was_probe = False`. (The current probe sequence has just concluded).
            *   **Rationale:** The probe has finished. Proceed to the next decision block to evaluate the results and decide on the current action.

    *   **C. Initial Round or Adaptive Phase (if not in Endgame and no probe is in progress):**

        *   **Round 1 Special Case:**
            *   **Condition:** If `current_round_number == 1`.
            *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
            *   Set `my_last_action_was_probe = True`.
            *   Set `probe_rounds_left = probe_length - 1`.
            *   Increment `consecutive_failed_probes` by 1.
            *   **Rationale:** Make an initial strategic investment by contributing. This aims to "prime the pump" by signaling a willingness to cooperate, potentially activating conditional cooperators among opponents, creating a public good to free-ride on later. This counts as the first probe attempt.
            *   *After this action, the decision for the current round is complete.*

        *   **Adaptive Decision (All other rounds):**
            *   Observe `S_others_prev_round`: the sum of contributions from the `n-1` other players in the *immediately preceding round*.
            *   Calculate `Avg_C_Rate_others = S_others_prev_round / (n-1)`.

            *   **If `Avg_C_Rate_others >= cooperation_defection_threshold`:**
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
                *   Reset `consecutive_failed_probes = 0`.
                *   **Rationale:** Others are contributing sufficiently to generate a public good. This is the optimal scenario for free-riding. Exploit this by contributing nothing and maximizing individual payoff.

            *   **Else (`Avg_C_Rate_others < cooperation_defection_threshold`):**
                *   **Condition:** If `consecutive_failed_probes < max_failed_probes`.
                    *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
                    *   Set `my_last_action_was_probe = True`.
                    *   Set `probe_rounds_left = probe_length - 1`.
                    *   Increment `consecutive_failed_probes` by 1.
                    *   **Rationale:** The level of collective contribution is too low for profitable free-riding. Initiate a new `probe_length`-round sequence of contributions as a strategic investment to re-stimulate cooperation among opponents. This is a calculated risk to potentially revive the public good for future exploitation.
                *   **Condition:** Else (`consecutive_failed_probes >= max_failed_probes`).
                    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
                    *   **Rationale:** Multiple attempts to re-stimulate cooperation through probes have failed. The environment appears unwilling to cooperate or is dominated by defectors. Further strategic contributions would be self-sabotage. Settle for the "all defect" equilibrium (payoff of 1) rather than continuing to incur losses.

---

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy embodies an exploitative mindset by:
1.  **Prioritizing Free-Riding:** Its default and preferred action is to defect whenever there's a sufficiently active public good.
2.  **Strategic Investment:** Contributions (in Round 1 and during probes) are not acts of altruism but calculated investments to either "prime the pump" or "re-start the engine" of collective contribution, solely for the purpose of enabling future free-riding.
3.  **Adaptive Self-Preservation:** It adapts to uncooperative environments by eventually abandoning costly attempts to stimulate cooperation, ensuring it doesn't perpetually lose money against defectors.
4.  **Endgame Ruthlessness:** It leverages backward induction to defect without hesitation in the final rounds, maximizing terminal payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_82 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Exploit (AE)", is designed to maximize individual payoff in the Public Goods Game by primarily free-riding while adaptively making strategic contributions only when necessary to sustain a sufficiently cooperative environment from which to benefit. It aims to exploit conditional cooperators and avoid wasting contributions on persistent defectors.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n)

**Internal Strategy Parameters:**
*   `warmup_rounds = 2`: Number of initial rounds to probe for cooperation and signal potential reciprocation.
*   `re_engagement_threshold = (k / n) / 2`: The minimum average contribution rate from *other* players in the previous round below which the strategy will make a strategic contribution to prevent a collapse of the public good. (This value ensures the threshold is responsive to the game's multiplier; e.g., if k/n is small, a low average from others might still prompt a re-engagement). The threshold will be floored at a minimum of `0.05` to avoid extremely small values.
*   `minimum_active_cooperators = 1`: The minimum number of *other* players who must have contributed in the previous round for the strategy to consider anything other than pure defection. If fewer than this, the pool is considered too "dead" to invest in.

**Decision Rules (Per Round):**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Reasoning:** Start with a cooperative move. This serves as an initial probe to test the willingness of other players to cooperate and can "prime the pump" for conditional cooperators. It also provides immediate data on initial player tendencies.

2.  **Rounds 2 to `warmup_rounds` (Cooperator Identification):**
    *   Let `total_contributions_prev` be the sum of all players' contributions in the previous round.
    *   **If `total_contributions_prev > 0`:**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   **Reasoning:** If there was any cooperation at all in the previous round, continue to signal reciprocity. This helps to identify conditional cooperators and solidify a baseline of contributions early in the game.
    *   **Else (`total_contributions_prev == 0`):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Reasoning:** If no one (including myself in Round 1) contributed, the pool is dead. There's no point in further initial investment.

3.  **Rounds `warmup_rounds` + 1 to `r` - 1 (Exploitation and Maintenance Phase):**
    *   Let `c_i_prev` be my own contribution (0 or 1) in the previous round.
    *   Let `total_contributions_prev` be the sum of all players' contributions in the previous round.
    *   Calculate `others_total_contributions_prev = total_contributions_prev - c_i_prev`.
    *   Count `num_other_cooperators_prev`: the number of *other players* who contributed 1 token in the previous round.
    *   Calculate `avg_others_contrib_rate = others_total_contributions_prev / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Condition 1: Is the pool essentially "dead" from others' contributions?**
        *   **If `num_other_cooperators_prev < minimum_active_cooperators`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reasoning:** If too few other players are contributing, the public good is effectively too small or non-existent to free-ride upon. My single contribution would be largely wasted. Prioritize immediate gain by defecting, as there's no exploitable base. This also prevents continuous contribution against "Always Defect" opponents.

    *   **Condition 2: Is the pool struggling, warranting my re-engagement?**
        *   **Else if `avg_others_contrib_rate < max(0.05, re_engagement_threshold)`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Reasoning:** The pool is not dead (Condition 1 failed), but the average contribution rate from others is low enough to threaten its sustainability. A strategic contribution here acts as a "maintenance cost" or "re-engagement" to prevent the complete collapse of cooperation, thereby preserving future free-riding opportunities. This is a self-interested investment in the system.

    *   **Condition 3: The pool is healthy enough for free-riding.**
        *   **Else (if `avg_others_contrib_rate >= max(0.05, re_engagement_threshold)` AND `num_other_cooperators_prev >= minimum_active_cooperators`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reasoning:** The level of cooperation from other players is sufficient to provide a good return even without my contribution. Maximize individual payoff by free-riding.

4.  **Round `r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to incentivize cooperation. The individually dominant strategy is to defect, maximizing the final payoff by exploiting any lingering cooperative tendencies of others.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_83 = '''
Here is an exploitative strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust:

**Strategy Name: The Adaptive Free-Rider**

This strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by strategically free-riding on others' contributions. It will encourage cooperation only when it's beneficial for future exploitation, and it will quickly revert to defection when cooperation is not profitable or sustainable.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: total number of players
*   `r`: total number of rounds
*   `k`: multiplier (1 < k < n)
*   `history`: All past actions and payoffs for all players.

**Internal Strategy Parameters:**
*   `BAIT_ROUNDS = 2`: The number of initial rounds to contribute.
*   `EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD = 0.5`: The minimum average contribution from other players in the previous round that will trigger immediate defection. (e.g., if 50% or more of other players contributed).
*   `REINDUCEMENT_THRESHOLD = 0.2`: The minimum average contribution from other players in the previous round that will trigger a strategic contribution from this player, aimed at re-inducing cooperation. (e.g., if between 20% and 50% of other players contributed).
*   `ENDGAME_ROUNDS = 1`: The number of final rounds where this strategy will always defect.

---

**Decision Rules (for the current Round `t`):**

1.  **Initial Bait Phase (Rounds `t <= BAIT_ROUNDS`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Proactively contribute for a few initial rounds to signal a cooperative stance. This serves as a "bait" to encourage other players, especially conditional cooperators (like Tit-for-Tat), to contribute. The goal is to establish a pool of public goods that can be exploited in later rounds.

2.  **Endgame Phase (Rounds `t > r - ENDGAME_ROUNDS`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds of the game, there are no future interactions to influence. The dominant strategy is to defect and maximize immediate gain. There is no incentive to maintain or re-induce cooperation.

3.  **Exploitation & Maintenance Phase (For all other rounds: `BAIT_ROUNDS < t <= r - ENDGAME_ROUNDS`):**
    *   **Information Gathering:**
        *   Retrieve the actions of all other players from the *previous round* (`t-1`).
        *   Calculate `total_other_contributions_prev_round`: The sum of contributions from *all other players* in round `t-1`.
        *   Calculate `avg_other_contributions_prev_round = total_other_contributions_prev_round / (n - 1)`.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `avg_other_contributions_prev_round >= EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** A sufficient number of other players are contributing, creating a valuable public good. This is the prime opportunity to free-ride and maximize personal payoff without reducing the collective good so severely that it collapses.
        *   **Else If `avg_other_contributions_prev_round >= REINDUCEMENT_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** The level of cooperation is declining but has not completely collapsed. A strategic contribution from this player might re-stimulate cooperation among conditional players, preventing a full breakdown of the public good. This is a calculated, short-term investment to potentially restore or sustain future opportunities for exploitation.
        *   **Else (If `avg_other_contributions_prev_round < REINDUCEMENT_THRESHOLD`):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** Cooperation has largely collapsed or is too low to be worth investing in. Contributing would be a pure loss for this player without sufficient returns from others. Join the general defection to minimize personal losses.

The following strategy, named "The Calculated Opportunist," is designed to be exploitative, adaptive, and robust in the Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize individual payoff by primarily free-riding on others' contributions, while strategically contributing only when necessary to initiate or revive a level of group cooperation that can then be exploited.

---

**Strategy Name: The Calculated Opportunist**

**Parameters:**
*   `defection_threshold`: A dynamic threshold representing the minimum average contribution from other players needed to trigger a "free-ride" decision.
    *   Calculated as `max(0.2, (k / n) * 0.8)`. This ensures a reasonable floor of 0.2 and scales the threshold with the game's multiplier (`k/n`), reflecting the potential profitability of the public good.
*   `re_cooperate_interval`: The number of consecutive rounds of defection by this strategy after which it will consider contributing again, provided there's some minimal sign of cooperation from others. Set to `3`.

**Internal State (tracked across rounds):**
*   `my_consecutive_defections`: An integer counter, initialized to 0. It tracks how many rounds this strategy has consecutively chosen to Defect (D).

**Decision Rules per Round (from `num_rounds_played = 1` to `r`):**

1.  **First Round (`num_rounds_played == 1`):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
    *   Reset `my_consecutive_defections = 0`.
    *   *Rationale:* This initial cooperation serves as a probe to gauge the cooperativeness of other players and potentially "bait" them into contributing, establishing a baseline for future exploitation.

2.  **Last Round (`num_rounds_played == r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection, making it the dominant strategy regardless of opponent behavior. Maximizing terminal payoff requires defection here.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < num_rounds_played < r`):**
    *   First, observe the contributions from *all other players* in the immediately preceding round (`num_rounds_played - 1`).
    *   Calculate `avg_c_others = (sum of c_j for all j != i in previous round) / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Primary Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `avg_c_others >= defection_threshold`:**
            *   The collective contribution from other players is sufficiently high to be exploited.
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   Increment `my_consecutive_defections` by 1.
            *   *Rationale:* This is the core free-riding mechanism. Exploit the existing cooperation to maximize personal gain without contributing.

        *   **Else (`avg_c_others < defection_threshold`):**
            *   Cooperation among other players is currently low.
            *   **Secondary Decision Logic (Attempt to Revive/Bait Cooperation):**
                *   **If `my_consecutive_defections >= re_cooperate_interval` AND `avg_c_others > 0` (i.e., at least one other player showed *some* cooperation in the previous round):**
                    *   This strategy has been defecting for a sustained period, and group cooperation, though low, is not entirely absent. It's time to attempt to "re-bait" cooperation.
                    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
                    *   Reset `my_consecutive_defections = 0`.
                    *   *Rationale:* This is a strategic re-investment. By occasionally cooperating even when others aren't strongly cooperative, this strategy attempts to prevent the complete collapse of group cooperation and stimulate a return to a state where free-riding is again profitable. This re-baiting is conditional on there being *some* residual cooperation in the group, ensuring the investment is not entirely futile.
                *   **Else (`my_consecutive_defections < re_cooperate_interval` OR `avg_c_others == 0`):**
                    *   Either this strategy hasn't been defecting long enough for a strategic re-bait, OR no other player contributed in the previous round (making a re-bait attempt futile).
                    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
                    *   Increment `my_consecutive_defections` by 1.
                    *   *Rationale:* Avoid wasting tokens when cooperation is low and a strategic re-bait isn't deemed necessary, effective, or justified due to a complete lack of cooperation from others.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_85 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to exploit other players' willingness to cooperate while minimizing its own contributions. It prioritizes self-interest, adapts to the observed level of cooperation, and leverages distinct phases of the game to maximize payoff.

**Game Parameters & History:**
*   `n`: number of players
*   `r`: total number of rounds
*   `k`: multiplier for contributions (`1 < k < n`)
*   `current_round`: The current round number (1 to `r`)
*   `history`: An array of records for each `past_round` (from 1 to `current_round - 1`), where each record contains:
    *   `c_j(past_round)`: Player `j`'s contribution (1 if C, 0 if D) in `past_round`.
    *   From this, `sum_{j!=self} c_j(past_round)` (total contributions from other players) can be derived.

**Internal Parameters (Derived from Game Parameters):**
*   `T_initial_rounds`: The number of initial rounds dedicated to "luring" cooperation.
    *   Calculated as `max(1, min(3, floor(r / 4)))`.
    *   *Purpose:* To signal initial cooperation, hoping to induce others to contribute, thereby creating a pool of contributions to free-ride on.
*   `T_endgame_rounds`: The number of final rounds dedicated to pure exploitation.
    *   Calculated as `max(1, min(3, floor(r / 4)))`.
    *   *Purpose:* To defect universally in the final rounds, as there are no future consequences to consider.
*   `Cooperation_Revival_Threshold`: The minimum average number of *other players* contributing in recent history that will cause the strategy to temporarily contribute to re-engage cooperation.
    *   Calculated as `max(1, floor((n - 1) * 0.5))`. (If `n=2`, threshold is 1; if `n>2`, it's at least 1, often higher).
    *   *Purpose:* If the observed cooperation from others drops too low, it's no longer profitable to free-ride. This threshold defines when it's strategically advantageous to "invest" a contribution to try and revive cooperation.
*   `W_recent_rounds`: The window size (number of recent past rounds) for calculating the average number of other players' contributions during the Adaptive Exploitation Phase.
    *   Set to `3`.

---

**Decision Rules (for the `current_round`):**

The strategy operates in three distinct phases, with precedence given to the Endgame phase, then Initial Lure, and finally Adaptive Exploitation.

**1. Endgame Defection Phase Check:**
   *   **If `current_round > r - T_endgame_rounds`:**
     **Decision: DEFECT (D)**.
     (Rationale: There are no future rounds for other players to react to, so maximize immediate payoff by contributing nothing and free-riding on any remaining contributions.)

**2. Initial Lure Phase Check:**
   *   **Else if `current_round <= T_initial_rounds`:**
     **Decision: CONTRIBUTE (C)**.
     (Rationale: Invest early to establish a reputation for cooperation, encouraging other players to contribute, which will then be exploited in later rounds.)

**3. Adaptive Exploitation Phase (Default):**
   *   **Else (i.e., `T_initial_rounds < current_round <= r - T_endgame_rounds`):**
     *   **Step A: Calculate Average Recent Cooperation from Others.**
         *   Determine the start round for the lookback window: `lookback_start_round = max(T_initial_rounds + 1, current_round - W_recent_rounds)`. This ensures we only look at rounds where the Adaptive Exploitation phase *could* have been active.
         *   Initialize `total_others_contributions_sum = 0` and `num_rounds_counted = 0`.
         *   For each `past_round` from `lookback_start_round` to `current_round - 1`:
             *   `total_others_contributions_sum += sum_{j!=self} c_j(past_round)`. (Sum of contributions from all other players in that specific `past_round`).
             *   `num_rounds_counted += 1`.
         *   If `num_rounds_counted == 0` (this happens if `current_round` is just `T_initial_rounds + 1`, and `W_recent_rounds` is greater than 1, meaning no full `W_recent_rounds` history exists yet for this phase), then use `num_rounds_counted = 1` and `total_others_contributions_sum` equals the other contributions from `current_round - 1`. (For simplicity in description: if `current_round = T_initial_rounds + 1`, then `average_others_contributions = sum_{j!=self} c_j(T_initial_rounds)`).
         *   `average_others_contributions = total_others_contributions_sum / num_rounds_counted`.

     *   **Step B: Decision Based on Average Cooperation.**
         *   **If `average_others_contributions < Cooperation_Revival_Threshold`:**
             **Decision: CONTRIBUTE (C)**.
             (Rationale: The observed level of cooperation from other players has fallen below a profitable threshold. A temporary contribution is made as an "investment" to signal renewed cooperation, attempting to re-engage others and restore a higher level of public good for future free-riding.)
         *   **Else (`average_others_contributions >= Cooperation_Revival_Threshold`):**
             **Decision: DEFECT (D)**.
             (Rationale: The observed level of cooperation from other players is sufficiently high. Continue to free-ride and maximize immediate individual payoff without contributing.)

---

This strategy is exploitative by:
*   **Luring:** Initial contributions are an investment to encourage others, not an act of genuine cooperation.
*   **Free-riding:** The default action is to defect, taking advantage of others' contributions.
*   **Calculated Re-engagement:** Contributions are only made when the collective good (and thus the potential for free-riding) is at risk of collapse, acting as a calculated "repair" rather than consistent cooperation.
*   **Endgame Abandonment:** Discards any pretense of cooperation in the final rounds for pure self-maximization.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_86 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Exploiter," is designed to maximize personal payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others, while strategically contributing only when necessary to maintain a profitable common pool or to prevent a complete collapse of cooperation. It adapts to the observed behavior of opponents and exploits end-game dynamics.

**Strategy: The Adaptive Exploiter**

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Internal State (maintained across rounds):**
*   `my_actions_history`: A list storing my action (1 for Contribute, 0 for Defect) for each past round.
*   `others_actions_history[player_id]`: A dictionary where each key `player_id` maps to a list of that player's actions (1 for Contribute, 0 for Defect) for all past rounds. (Exclude self from `player_id`s).

**Decision Logic (executed at the start of each round):**

**Phase 1: Initial Probe (Round 1)**

*   **Round 1:** Always Contribute (C).
    *   *Reasoning:* Start with a cooperative signal. This serves as an initial investment to gather data on opponent tendencies and potentially encourage a cooperative environment that can be exploited later.

**Phase 2: Adaptive Exploitation (Rounds 2 to `r - 2`)**

*   *This phase is active only if `r >= 4`. If `r < 4`, only Phase 1 and Phase 3 apply, or only Phase 1 if `r=1`.*

*   **Before making a decision in this phase, calculate the following metrics based on all *previous* rounds:**
    *   `previous_round_cooperation_score_others`: The sum of contributions by *other* players in the immediate previous round.
    *   `overall_average_cooperation_rate_others`: The total sum of contributions by *all other* players across *all past rounds*, divided by `((n-1) * (current_round - 1))`. This represents the average proportion of contributions from others over the game's history.

*   **Decision Rules:**

    1.  **Exploitation Trigger (High Overall Cooperation):**
        *   If `overall_average_cooperation_rate_others >= 0.75`:
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Reasoning:* When the overall environment is highly cooperative, there's a robust opportunity to free-ride aggressively without immediately triggering a complete breakdown. This is the primary exploitative maneuver.

    2.  **Maintain Highly Profitable Cooperation:**
        *   Else if `previous_round_cooperation_score_others >= ceil(n / k)`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   *Reasoning:* The term `ceil(n/k)` represents a critical threshold. If the total contributions from others in the previous round reached this level, the common pool is providing a return `(k/n) * previous_round_cooperation_score_others` that is highly profitable (roughly or exactly `1` or more per individual contribution to the pool). In this scenario, it is rational to contribute to sustain this highly lucrative cooperative state, preventing a potential collapse that would diminish own gains.

    3.  **Encourage Fragile Cooperation:**
        *   Else if `previous_round_cooperation_score_others > 0` AND `overall_average_cooperation_rate_others >= 0.3`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   *Reasoning:* If there's some cooperation (but not enough to meet the highly profitable threshold) and the overall trend among opponents isn't entirely selfish, contribute to encourage this fragile cooperation. A defection in this situation might tip marginal cooperators towards full defection, leading to a less profitable game for everyone, including the exploiter.

    4.  **Avoid Being a Sucker (Low/No Cooperation):**
        *   Else (i.e., `previous_round_cooperation_score_others == 0` OR `overall_average_cooperation_rate_others < 0.3`):
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Reasoning:* If cooperation is consistently low or entirely absent, contributing is pointless and only makes this player a "sucker." Defect to minimize losses.

**Phase 3: End Game Exploitation (Rounds `r - 1` and `r`)**

*   *This phase is active only if `r >= 2`. If `r=1`, only Phase 1 applies.*

*   **Rounds `r - 1` and `r`:** Always Defect (D).
    *   *Reasoning:* In the final rounds of a repeated game, the incentive for future cooperation vanishes. The individually rational (and most exploitative) strategy is to defect, as there are no repercussions for breaking cooperation. This strategy capitalizes on this effect by switching to full defection in the final two rounds.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_87 = '''
This strategy, named "The Cunning Free-Rider," is designed for maximum exploitation in the Public Goods Game. It prioritizes individual gain by free-riding on the contributions of others, only contributing when absolutely necessary to prevent the complete collapse of the public good pool, and then immediately reverting to free-riding. It is adaptive to opponent behavior and robust across various game settings.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (where `1 < k < n`)

**Internal State:**
*   `just_baited_last_round`: A boolean flag, initialized to `False`. This flag is set to `True` if the strategy contributed in the previous round specifically to "re-prime" cooperation, and `False` otherwise.

**Configurable Thresholds:**
*   `r_endgame_start`: The round number from which end-game behavior begins.
    *   **Recommendation:** `max(2, r - 3)`. This means the strategy will defect in the last 3 rounds. For games with fewer than 3 rounds, it will defect in all but potentially the very first round.
*   `coop_recharge_threshold`: The minimum number of *other* players contributing in the previous round that is considered "sufficient" for me to continue free-riding.
    *   **Recommendation:** `max(1, floor((n - 1) / 2))`. This means if at least half of the other players contributed in the previous round, I will continue to free-ride.

---

**Decision Rules (in order of priority):**

**1. First Round (`current_round == 1`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** Establish a default behavior of free-riding immediately. This allows the strategy to observe initial player intentions and willingness to contribute without incurring any personal cost, while simultaneously benefiting from any initial naive cooperation.

**2. End-game Phase (`current_round >= r_endgame_start`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** The "shadow of the future" (the potential for future interactions to influence current behavior) has diminished or disappeared. Rational players will revert to the dominant strategy of defection. This strategy fully exploits any lingering cooperation during these final rounds.

**3. Intermediate Rounds (`1 < current_round < r_endgame_start`):**

    *   **A. Check if I just "baited" someone:**
        *   If `just_baited_last_round` is `True`:
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   **Rationale:** The "bait" (my previous contribution) has been cast. Now, immediately revert to free-riding to see if it induced others to increase their contributions.
            *   Set `just_baited_last_round = False`.

    *   **B. Calculate `C_others_prev`:**
        *   Count the number of players (excluding self) who contributed in the *previous* round.

    *   **C. Evaluate `C_others_prev` to decide action:**
        *   **If `C_others_prev >= coop_recharge_threshold`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   **Rationale:** Others are contributing sufficiently to maintain a meaningful public good. Continue to free-ride, maximizing personal gain from the public good without contributing any tokens.

        *   **Else (`C_others_prev < coop_recharge_threshold`):**
            *   **If `C_others_prev == 0` (No other player contributed last round):**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                *   **Rationale:** Cooperation has completely collapsed among all other players, meaning the public good will yield zero payoff. This single contribution is a calculated, strategic attempt to "re-prime" the system. It aims to signal to other players that cooperation is still possible, hoping to entice them to contribute in future rounds, thereby rebuilding the public good for my subsequent free-riding.
                *   Set `just_baited_last_round = True`.
            *   **Else (`C_others_prev` is low but *not zero*, i.e., at least one other player contributed, but fewer than `coop_recharge_threshold`):**
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   **Rationale:** While cooperation is low, it hasn't completely collapsed. There is still some public good being generated from the few existing contributors. It is not yet critical for me to contribute. Continue to free-ride, conserving my token while benefiting from the existing, albeit small, pool of contributions.

---

**Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:**

*   **Default Self-Interest:** The strategy starts and ends with defection, establishing a baseline of prioritizing individual gain.
*   **Maximized Free-Riding:** It actively seeks to benefit from others' contributions while minimizing its own, only contributing under extreme duress.
*   **Strategic Contribution as Bait:** Any contribution is not driven by reciprocity or collective welfare, but by a calculated, temporary investment aimed solely at restoring conditions favorable for future free-riding. It's a "bait and switch" maneuver.
*   **Adaptive to Exploit:** It continuously monitors opponent behavior to identify opportunities for free-riding (when others are cooperating) or to strategically intervene to prevent complete system collapse (to keep future exploitation possible).
*   **End-Game Ruthlessness:** It fully leverages the rational unraveling of cooperation in the final rounds, ensuring maximal extraction when repercussions no longer exist.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_88 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Opportunist," aims to maximize individual payoff by strategically free-riding on the contributions of others while ensuring the public good doesn't collapse entirely, which would eliminate future free-riding opportunities. It balances aggressive exploitation with a pragmatic approach to maintaining a minimal level of cooperation in the game.

**Strategy Parameters:**

*   `n`: total number of players
*   `r`: total number of rounds
*   `k`: multiplier (1 < k < n)
*   `INITIAL_INVESTMENT_ROUNDS`: Set to **2 rounds**. This determines how many initial rounds the strategy will contribute unconditionally to signal cooperation.
*   `ENDGAME_ROUNDS`: Set to **1 round**. This determines how many final rounds the strategy will defect unconditionally.
*   `CONTRIBUTION_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD`: The minimum number of *other players* who must have contributed in the *previous round* for this strategy to feel comfortable free-riding. Calculated as `ceil((n - 1) * 0.5)`. This means if at least half of the other players contributed, the public good is considered sufficiently healthy for exploitation.

**Decision Rules (Per Round):**

1.  **Initial Investment Phase (Rounds 1 to `INITIAL_INVESTMENT_ROUNDS`):**
    *   In the first `INITIAL_INVESTMENT_ROUNDS` (e.g., rounds 1 and 2), the strategy will unconditionally **Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This acts as an initial "investment" to signal a willingness to cooperate and encourage other players to contribute. It helps establish a baseline of public good and identifies potential cooperators in the player pool. This is a calculated risk to foster an environment conducive to future exploitation.

2.  **Endgame Phase (Rounds `r - ENDGAME_ROUNDS + 1` to `r`):**
    *   In the final `ENDGAME_ROUNDS` (e.g., only the last round), the strategy will unconditionally **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* With no future rounds to incentivize cooperation, the dominant strategy of free-riding becomes paramount. There is no strategic benefit to contributing when no further interactions are possible to build or maintain cooperation.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (All other rounds):**
    *   Let `other_contributions_prev_round` be the sum of contributions from all *other players* in the immediately preceding round (i.e., total contributions in the previous round minus this strategy's own contribution in the previous round).
    *   **If `other_contributions_prev_round >= CONTRIBUTION_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD`:**
        *   The public good is currently sufficiently supported by others' contributions. This strategy will **Defect (D)**.
        *   *Rationale:* Exploit the existing cooperation by free-riding to maximize individual payoff. The public good is healthy enough to support this defection without immediate collapse.
    *   **Else (`other_contributions_prev_round < CONTRIBUTION_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD`):**
        *   The public good is not sufficiently supported by others; cooperation may be faltering or has not fully established itself. This strategy will **Contribute (C)**.
        *   *Rationale:* This acts as a "re-investment" or "seed contribution" to try and prevent the complete collapse of the public good. If the public good deteriorates too much, there will be nothing left to free-ride upon, so a temporary contribution is a strategic move to encourage others to resume contributing.

**Exploitative Alignment:**

This strategy is fundamentally exploitative because its default action is to defect when the public good is viable (`other_contributions_prev_round >= CONTRIBUTION_MAINTENANCE_THRESHOLD`). It only contributes when it believes cooperation needs to be *re-seeded* to ensure future opportunities for free-riding, or during initial rounds to gauge the environment. The endgame phase explicitly leverages the lack of future interaction to defect without consequence. Its goal is never to sustain mutual cooperation for collective gain, but rather to extract maximum personal benefit from others' willingness to contribute.

The following strategy, "The Adaptive Opportunist," is designed to maximize individual payoff in the Public Goods Game by primarily free-riding on others' contributions, while adaptively intervening with minimal contributions only when necessary to sustain a sufficiently exploitable level of collective good.

---

**Strategy Name:** The Adaptive Opportunist

**Internal State Variables:**
*   `my_last_action`: Stores this player's action (Contribute 'C' or Defect 'D') from the immediately preceding round. Initialized to 'D' at the start of the game.
*   `cooperation_history`: A list storing, for each past round, the count of contributions made by *all other players* (sum of c_j for j != i).
*   `lookback_rounds`: An integer parameter, fixed at `3`. This determines how many immediate past rounds are considered when calculating the `recent_cooperation_rate`. For very short games or early rounds where less than `3` rounds are available, it uses all available past rounds.
*   `cooperation_revival_threshold`: A numerical threshold, set to `0.25` (i.e., 25%). This represents the minimum proportion of *other* players that must have contributed, on average, in the `lookback_rounds` for this strategy to continue free-riding. If cooperation falls below this level, a "priming" action is considered.

**Decision Rules (for the current round, `round_number`):**

1.  **First Round (`round_number == 1`):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* Maximize immediate individual gain and probe the environment for the presence of cooperators without any initial investment.
    *   Update `my_last_action` to 'D'.

2.  **Last Round (`round_number == r`):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* There are no future rounds, so there is no strategic incentive to contribute to influence future behavior. Maximize immediate and final payoff.
    *   Update `my_last_action` to 'D'.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < round_number < r`):**

    *   **Step 1: Calculate Recent Cooperation Rate of Others.**
        *   Determine the number of rounds to consider for history: `effective_lookback = min(round_number - 1, lookback_rounds)`.
        *   Retrieve the `cooperation_history` for these `effective_lookback` rounds.
        *   Calculate `sum_other_contributions_recent`: The total sum of contributions made by *all other players* across these `effective_lookback` rounds.
        *   Calculate `possible_max_contributions`: `(n - 1) * effective_lookback`.
        *   `recent_cooperation_rate = sum_other_contributions_recent / possible_max_contributions`. (If `possible_max_contributions` is 0, e.g., in round 1, then this calculation is skipped, and the strategy proceeds based on `my_last_action` which would be 'D').

    *   **Step 2: Decide Action Based on Last Action and Cooperation Rate.**

        *   **If `my_last_action` was 'C' (Contribute) in the previous round:**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* The "priming" action has been delivered. Now revert to free-riding to observe if it induced more cooperation from others. This ensures contributions are minimal and strategic.
            *   Update `my_last_action` to 'D'.

        *   **Else (`my_last_action` was 'D' in the previous round):**
            *   **If `recent_cooperation_rate` is less than `cooperation_revival_threshold`:**
                *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)**.
                *   *Rationale:* The level of cooperation among other players has dropped too low, potentially making continued free-riding unprofitable. This contribution is a strategic "re-prime" to stimulate more cooperation from others, hoping to create a larger pool to free-ride on in subsequent rounds.
                *   Update `my_last_action` to 'C'.
            *   **Else (`recent_cooperation_rate` is greater than or equal to `cooperation_revival_threshold`):**
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)**.
                *   *Rationale:* Cooperation levels among others are sufficient to make free-riding profitable. Continue maximizing individual payoff without personal contribution.
                *   Update `my_last_action` to 'D'.

**Exploitative Alignment:**

"The Adaptive Opportunist" is unequivocally exploitative because:
*   **Default Defection:** Its primary mode of operation is to **Defect**, thereby securing its private endowment while simultaneously benefiting from any contributions made by other players. This directly exploits the collective good.
*   **Strategic Priming:** The only instances it **Contributes** are highly conditional and self-serving. It acts only when cooperation levels among others fall so low that the *exploiter's own payoff* would be significantly diminished. This contribution is a minimal, short-term investment designed to "re-prime" the public good, not for collective benefit, but to restore a sufficiently high pool of contributions for subsequent free-riding.
*   **Immediate Reversion:** After any "priming" contribution, the strategy immediately reverts to **Defecting** in the next round. This demonstrates that the contribution was a calculated maneuver rather than a sustained commitment to cooperation, effectively acting as a "bait-and-switch" to entice others back to contributing for the exploiter's benefit.
*   **Disregard for Collective Welfare:** The strategy is entirely driven by maximizing its own payoff and shows no inherent concern for the overall efficiency or fairness of the game outcome, only for maintaining the conditions necessary for its own profitable free-riding.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_90 = '''
This strategy, named "The Calculated Predator," is designed to be highly exploitative, maximizing individual gain by strategically leveraging or disincentivizing cooperation from others. It operates on the principle of free-riding when possible, only contributing as a calculated investment to re-establish an exploitable cooperative environment, or to avoid being a complete "sucker" when cooperation has entirely collapsed.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r_max`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Strategy Parameters (Tunable):**
*   `INITIAL_PROBE_ROUNDS = 3`: Number of initial rounds to unconditionally cooperate to test opponent types and potentially induce early cooperation.
*   `END_GAME_ROUNDS = 5`: Number of final rounds where the strategy always defects, anticipating the breakdown of reciprocity.
*   `HIGH_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD = 0.7`: If the average opponent cooperation rate (over `MEMORY_ROUNDS`) meets or exceeds this, the strategy will defect to free-ride.
*   `CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD = 0.3`: If the average opponent cooperation rate (over `MEMORY_ROUNDS`) falls to or below this, the strategy will defect to avoid being exploited, as the system has largely collapsed.
*   `RESET_CONTRIBUTION_INTERVAL = 5`: The minimum number of consecutive rounds the strategy must have defected before it considers making a strategic "re-seeding" contribution (C) in a moderately cooperative environment. This prevents excessive contributions.
*   `MEMORY_ROUNDS = 5`: The number of most recent rounds to consider when calculating the average opponent cooperation rate. This provides a smoothed view of the cooperative climate.

**State Variables (Managed by the strategy):**
*   `rounds_since_last_C`: A counter for how many consecutive rounds this player has chosen to Defect (D).
*   `my_last_action`: Stores 'C' or 'D' from the previous round's decision.
*   `opponent_cooperation_history`: A list storing the average opponent cooperation rate for each of the last `MEMORY_ROUNDS`.

---

**Decision Rules (for current round `r`):**

**1. Initialization (Before Round 1):**
    *   Set `rounds_since_last_C = 0`.
    *   Set `my_last_action = null`.
    *   Initialize `opponent_cooperation_history` as an empty list.

**2. Round Action Logic:**

    *   **Phase 1: Initial Probe (`r <= INITIAL_PROBE_ROUNDS`)**
        *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
        *   *Rationale:* This initial cooperation serves as a probe to identify potentially cooperative opponents and signals a willingness to engage, aiming to establish an environment that can later be exploited.

    *   **Phase 2: End Game (`r > r_max - END_GAME_ROUNDS`)**
        *   **Action: Defect (D).**
        *   *Rationale:* As the game approaches its conclusion, the "shadow of the future" diminishes. There is no incentive for future reciprocity, making defection the dominant and most exploitative strategy.

    *   **Phase 3: Adaptive Exploitation (All other rounds - Mid-game)**
        *   **a. Update Opponent Cooperation History:**
            *   Calculate `current_opponent_cooperation_rate` based on the previous round's observed actions: `(sum of c_j for all j != i in previous round) / (n - 1)`.
            *   Add `current_opponent_cooperation_rate` to `opponent_cooperation_history`.
            *   If `len(opponent_cooperation_history)` exceeds `MEMORY_ROUNDS`, remove the oldest entry.
            *   Calculate `avg_opponent_cooperation_rate_longterm = average of all values in opponent_cooperation_history`.

        *   **b. Core Exploitation Decision:**

            *   **If `avg_opponent_cooperation_rate_longterm >= HIGH_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:**
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Rationale:* Opponents are sufficiently cooperative. This is the prime opportunity to free-ride and maximize personal payoff without significantly risking the collapse of cooperation.

            *   **Else if `avg_opponent_cooperation_rate_longterm <= CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:**
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Rationale:* Cooperation has significantly diminished or collapsed. Further contribution would be largely unrewarded and would make this player a "sucker." The strategy defects to avoid further loss.

            *   **Else (Moderate Cooperation: `CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD < avg_opponent_cooperation_rate_longterm < HIGH_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):**
                *   Cooperation is present but not robust, or it's showing signs of decline. This phase is for strategic interventions.
                *   **If `my_last_action == 'D'` AND `rounds_since_last_C >= RESET_CONTRIBUTION_INTERVAL`:**
                    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                    *   *Rationale:* This is a calculated, infrequent "investment" to "re-seed" or re-stimulate cooperation among conditional cooperators who might be on the verge of defecting. The aim is to nudge the system back towards a higher level of cooperation that can then be exploited again. This action is taken only after a sufficient period of free-riding.
                *   **Else (Continue Defecting or if C was just played):**
                    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                    *   *Rationale:* Maintain the default free-riding stance, or avoid immediate re-contribution if a "re-seed" was just attempted.

**3. Post-Round Update (After the decision for the current round `r` has been made and executed):**
    *   If the chosen action for the current round was 'C': Reset `rounds_since_last_C = 0`.
    *   If the chosen action for the current round was 'D': Increment `rounds_since_last_C = rounds_since_last_C + 1`.
    *   Set `my_last_action` to the action taken in the current round.

---

**Exploitative Alignment:**

*   **Default Free-Riding:** The strategy's primary mode is defection, especially when others are cooperating significantly.
*   **Calculated Contribution:** Contributions are not acts of goodwill but strategic investments. They are infrequent and designed solely to maintain or restore an environment where the player can subsequently free-ride more effectively.
*   **End-Game Betrayal:** Unconditional defection in the final rounds leverages the absence of future consequences.
*   **Self-Preservation:** Avoids being a "sucker" by matching defection when cooperation is too low to be beneficial.

This strategy is adaptive to opponent behavior, robust against various opponent types (from pure cooperators to pure defectors), and explicitly designed to maximize its own payoff through calculated free-riding and strategic manipulation of the cooperative climate.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_91 = '''
Here is an exploitative strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive, robust, and prioritize individual payoff maximization by strategically leveraging the contributions of others.

---

**Strategy Name: The Adaptive Extractor**

This strategy focuses on free-riding by default, making calculated "investments" only when necessary to sustain highly profitable levels of collective cooperation, and aggressively defecting when there's no longer a strategic benefit to contributing.

**Game Parameters Available:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n).

**Information Available (History):**
*   For each past round `t'` (from 1 to current round `t-1`):
    *   `c_j_{t'}`: Contribution (1 for C, 0 for D) of player `j` in round `t'`.
    *   `pi_j_{t'}`: Payoff of player `j` in round `t'`.

**Internal State (Reset for each new game):**
*   `my_contributions_so_far`: Tracks how many times *this player* has contributed in the current game.
*   `last_round_others_contributions`: Stores the sum of contributions from *other* players in the previous round.

---

**Decision Logic for current Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Endgame Phase (Aggressive Defection):**
    *   **Condition:** If `t > r - max(1, min(floor(r/3), 5))`.
        *   *Rationale for `max(1, min(floor(r/3), 5))`*: This sets an adaptive end-game horizon. For very short games (`r=1, 2, 3`), it's 1 round. For moderately long games, it's about 1/3 of the rounds (up to a maximum of 5 rounds). This balances strict backward induction with robustness against non-rational opponents who might cooperate longer.
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   *Reasoning:* In the final rounds, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. Backward induction implies universal defection. This strategy fully exploits any remaining "naive" contributors by maximizing immediate payoff.

2.  **Initial Assessment Phase (Testing the Waters):**
    *   **Condition:** Else if `t <= 2`.
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   *Reasoning:* Establish a baseline. Observe how many others contribute without any investment from us. This helps identify the general cooperativeness of the group and potential opportunities for free-riding.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (Mid-Game Optimization):**
    *   **Condition:** All other rounds (`2 < t <= r - max(1, min(floor(r/3), 5))`).
    *   **Observation:** Let `C_others_last_round = sum_{j!=i} c_j_{t-1}` (total contributions from *other* players in the previous round).

    *   **Decision Rules:**

        *   **Scenario A: Very Strong Collective Cooperation (Sustaining the Goldmine)**
            *   **Condition:** If `C_others_last_round >= round(0.75 * (n-1))`. (Meaning at least 75% of *other* players contributed).
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Reasoning:* When cooperation is overwhelmingly strong, the shared pool is highly profitable. Our defection, while immediately beneficial, risks destabilizing this lucrative state, potentially leading to a significant drop in future collective contributions. A token contribution here is a calculated investment to help *sustain* this high level of cooperation, ensuring continued high returns for us in subsequent rounds, which outweighs the cost of a single token.

        *   **Scenario B: Moderate to Low Other-Player Cooperation (Optimal Free-Riding)**
            *   **Condition:** Else (i.e., `C_others_last_round < round(0.75 * (n-1))`).
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   *Reasoning:* In all other scenarios where collective cooperation isn't at its peak, the strategy defaults to free-riding. Others are contributing enough (or not enough) to make the shared pool valuable, but not so much that our defection would severely jeopardize a highly profitable situation. We maximize our per-round profit by keeping our token and benefiting from the existing contributions of others, without investing our own. There is no strategic benefit in contributing in these scenarios from an exploitative perspective.

**Post-Action Update (after determining `c_i` for round `t`):**
*   If `c_i = 1` (we contributed), increment `my_contributions_so_far`.
*   Store `C_others_last_round` for the next round's calculation.

---

**Summary of Exploitative Alignment:**

*   **Default Defection:** The strategy's primary stance is defection, the purely self-interested action in a one-shot PGG.
*   **Conditional Investment:** Contributions are made only when collective cooperation is exceptionally high (Scenario A), viewing them as strategic "investments" to *maintain* a highly profitable pool for future free-riding, rather than an act of genuine cooperation.
*   **Aggressive End-Game Exploitation:** The strategy fully leverages backward induction by defecting in the final rounds, extracting maximum value from any remaining contributors without concern for future interactions.
*   **Adaptive and Robust:** It dynamically responds to the observed level of cooperation from other players, adjusting its behavior to optimize free-riding across different game conditions and opponent strategies. Thresholds are based on `n`, making it scalable.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_92 = '''
This strategy, named "The Strategic Free-Rider," is designed to maximize its own cumulative payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of other players. It employs a default defection stance, interspersed with minimal, calculated contributions only as strategic investments to encourage or re-establish a sufficiently large pool of public goods from others, which it can then exploit.

### 1. Decision Rules:

*   **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   If `r == 1` (the game consists of only one round):
        *   **Contribute 0 tokens (Defect - D).**
        *   *Rationale:* In a single-round game, defection is the individually dominant strategy because `(k / n) < 1`. There are no future rounds to influence.
    *   If `r > 1`:
        *   **Contribute 1 token (Cooperate - C).**
        *   *Rationale:* This is a calculated, small initial investment. Its purpose is to "probe" the environment for cooperative opponents. By contributing once, the strategy signals a potential willingness to cooperate, which might induce other "nice" or reciprocal strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat) to contribute in subsequent rounds. The ultimate goal is to establish a pool of public goods that this strategy can then free-ride upon.

*   **Middle Rounds (Round 2 to Round `r-1`):**
    *   **Default Action: Contribute 0 tokens (Defect - D).**
    *   *Rationale:* The primary objective is to maximize immediate payoff by minimizing personal cost. Unless specific conditions are met for a strategic re-engagement, the strategy will always choose to free-ride.
    *   **Adaptive Re-engagement Condition (Re-Bait):**
        *   The strategy will consider contributing 1 token (Cooperate - C) for a *single round* only if **ALL** of the following conditions are met:
            1.  `current_round < r - floor(r / 4)`: There are enough rounds remaining in the game to potentially benefit from re-engaging cooperation and subsequently free-riding. This prevents pointless contributions near the end of the game.
            2.  `my_last_action` (in the previous round) was Defect (D): This ensures that the re-bait is a distinct strategic action taken after a period of defection, rather than continuous contributions.
            3.  `others_contributed_last_round < n / 4`: The number of contributions from other players in the *immediately preceding round* was very low (less than 25% of other players), indicating a severe collapse or near-collapse of the public good.
            4.  `average_others_contribution_rate_past_W_rounds < 0.3`: The average proportion of other players contributing over the last `W` rounds (where `W = max(3, floor(r/5))`) is consistently very low (less than 30%), confirming a sustained lack of cooperation.
            5.  `k / n > 0.3`: The efficiency of the public good (marginal return for contribution) is sufficiently high to make re-establishing cooperation potentially worthwhile. If `k/n` is too low, the public good provides too little benefit even if fully funded, making investment pointless.
        *   If all these conditions are met, the strategy will **Contribute 1 token (Cooperate - C)** for the current round. Immediately after this strategic re-bait, the strategy reverts to its default of Defect (D) unless these exact re-engagement conditions are met again in a future round.
        *   *Rationale:* This is a last-resort, calculated re-investment. If the public good has almost entirely collapsed, continued defection yields very little (approaching 1 per round). A single, carefully timed strategic contribution might "jolt" other players back into contributing, creating a new opportunity for this strategy to free-ride.

*   **Final Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Contribute 0 tokens (Defect - D).**
    *   *Rationale:* There are no subsequent rounds to influence player behavior. Based on backward induction, the game-theoretic dominant strategy in the final round is to defect.

### 2. Handling Edge Cases:

*   **Single-round game (`r = 1`):** Explicitly handled; the strategy defects.
*   **First round (`current_round = 1`):** Handled by the "Initial Probe" rule.
*   **Last round (`current_round = r`):** Handled by the "Final Round" rule.
*   **Small `r` values:** The parameters `floor(r/4)` for end-game avoidance and `W = max(3, floor(r/5))` for calculating the average contribution rate adapt to smaller game lengths, ensuring a minimum observation window while scaling with `r`.

### 3. Exploitative Alignment:

*   **Primary Goal:** The strategy's design is fundamentally self-interested, prioritizing its own payoff above all else.
*   **Minimal Contribution:** Contributions are kept to an absolute minimum and are never out of altruism. They are strictly strategic investments with the expectation of a greater future return in the form of others' contributions.
*   **Free-Riding Dominance:** The default action is always to defect, capitalizing on any public good created by other players without incurring the personal cost of contribution.
*   **Leveraging Others:** The initial probe and re-engagement conditions aim to exploit the cooperative tendencies or reciprocal strategies of other AI systems, "nudging" them towards contributing so that "The Strategic Free-Rider" can benefit.
*   **No Long-Term Cooperation:** The strategy avoids sustaining cooperation on its own part, always reverting to defection to maximize its free-riding potential.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_93 = '''
Here is a natural language description of an adaptive and exploitative strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to maximize individual payoff by strategically leveraging and undermining collective cooperation.

---

**Strategy Name: The Adaptive Free-Rider**

This strategy aims to exploit the cooperation of other players while intelligently re-engaging or disengaging to prevent the game from collapsing entirely. It is highly adaptive to the observed behavior of opponents and robust across various player profiles.

**1. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1: Initial Probe (Always Cooperate)**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** Begin with a cooperative action. This serves as an initial test of the game environment and a signal to other players (especially conditional cooperators like Tit-for-Tat variants) that cooperation is possible. This investment aims to "seed" the public good and encourage others to contribute, setting up future opportunities for free-riding.

*   **Rounds 2 to (r-1): Adaptive Exploitation Phase**
    *   At the start of each round `t` (from 2 up to `r-1`), the strategy assesses the collective cooperation level of *other* players in the previous round `(t-1)`.
    *   Let `N_others = n-1` be the number of other players.
    *   Calculate `P_coop_others = (Sum of contributions from all other players in round t-1) / N_others`. This is the proportion of other players who contributed in the last round.
    *   Let `My_Last_Action` be this strategy's own action in round `t-1`.

    *   **Phase A: High Cooperation (Exploit Immediately)**
        *   **Condition:** If `P_coop_others >= 0.6` (i.e., 60% or more of other players contributed).
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale:** When a significant portion of other players are reliably contributing, the strategy has a strong public good to free-ride upon. It maximizes its current round's payoff by keeping its private token while still benefiting from others' contributions. This is direct exploitation.

    *   **Phase B: Low Cooperation (Cut Losses)**
        *   **Condition:** If `P_coop_others <= 0.2` (i.e., 20% or less of other players contributed).
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale:** If too few others are contributing, the public good is too small to make a personal contribution worthwhile (since `1 - k/n > 0`, contributing is a net loss to the individual unless sufficient others also contribute). In this scenario, the strategy minimizes its losses by keeping its token, as its single contribution is unlikely to turn the tide.

    *   **Phase C: Moderate Cooperation (Strategic Fluctuation for Re-engagement or Exploitation)**
        *   **Condition:** If `0.2 < P_coop_others < 0.6` (cooperation is neither robust nor fully collapsed).
        *   **Sub-Condition 1: If `My_Last_Action == D` (I defected in the previous round):**
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Rationale:** After a round of defection, if cooperation is in this moderate, fragile state, a strategic contribution serves as a "re-engagement" or "bait." It's a calculated investment to test if conditional cooperators will respond positively, preventing a further downward spiral and potentially restoring the `P_coop_others` to a level where the strategy can free-ride again.
        *   **Sub-Condition 2: If `My_Last_Action == C` (I contributed in the previous round):**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** After demonstrating cooperation, the strategy immediately attempts to free-ride on any goodwill or induced cooperation. This tests the limits of exploitation, aiming to maximize payoff while gauging how much pressure the system can take before `P_coop_others` drops to the "Low Cooperation" zone.

*   **Last Round (Round r): Final Exploitation**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of a finite repeated game, there are no future interactions or consequences for current actions. The dominant strategy for a single-shot PGG (defection) applies. Contributing would be a guaranteed net loss of `1 - k/n` for the player, as there's no opportunity to benefit from future induced cooperation.

**2. Handling Edge Cases:**

*   **First Round (t=1):** Handled by the "Initial Probe" rule (always Contribute).
*   **Last Round (t=r):** Handled by the "Final Exploitation" rule (always Defect).
*   **Zero Cooperation from Others:** If `P_coop_others == 0`, the strategy falls under the "Low Cooperation" rule and defects, correctly identifying no benefit in contributing.
*   **Full Cooperation from Others:** If `P_coop_others == 1`, the strategy falls under the "High Cooperation" rule and defects, maximally exploiting the situation.

**3. Exploitative Alignment:**

The "Adaptive Free-Rider" strategy is inherently exploitative because:
*   It prioritizes defection whenever a critical mass of cooperation exists (`P_coop_others >= 0.6`), directly free-riding on the contributions of others.
*   Its contributions (`0.2 < P_coop_others < 0.6` and `My_Last_Action == D`) are not altruistic but strategic investments designed to *re-establish* a cooperative environment that can be exploited in subsequent rounds. It's a calculated risk to prevent the game from collapsing to an all-defection state, which would yield minimal payoffs.
*   It fully leverages the end-game effect by defecting in the final round, disregarding any past cooperative behavior of others.
*   Its initial cooperation is a "charm offensive" to potentially lure conditional cooperators into a pattern of contributions that the strategy can then exploit.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_94 = '''
The "Calculated Predator" Strategy

This strategy is designed to be highly exploitative, consistently aiming to free-ride on the contributions of other players while strategically intervening only when absolutely necessary to prevent a complete collapse of cooperation, thereby preserving future exploitation opportunities. It prioritizes maximizing its own payoff and minimizes its own contributions.

**Strategy Parameters:**

*   `Exploit_Threshold_High_Cooperation` (e.g., 0.6): The proportion of other players (excluding self) who contributed in the previous round that, if met or exceeded, signals a sufficiently high level of cooperation for the strategy to confidently defect and free-ride.
*   `Re-Engagement_Threshold_Low_Cooperation` (e.g., 0.2): The proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round that, if fallen below, signals a critical decline in cooperation, potentially warranting a re-engagement attempt.
*   `Re_Engagement_Max_Rounds` (e.g., 2): The maximum number of consecutive rounds the strategy will contribute during a single re-engagement attempt. This is a short, calculated investment.
*   `Re_Engagement_Cooldown_Rounds` (e.g., 3): The number of rounds to wait after initiating a re-engagement attempt before another attempt can be considered, regardless of cooperation levels. This prevents the strategy from endlessly spending resources on unresponsive groups.

**Internal State Variables:**

*   `in_re_engagement_phase`: A boolean flag, `True` if the strategy is currently committed to contributing for a set number of rounds to re-stimulate cooperation. (Initial: `False`)
*   `rounds_contributed_in_phase`: An integer counter for how many rounds have been contributed during the current `in_re_engagement_phase`. (Initial: `0`)
*   `cooldown_timer`: An integer counter tracking rounds since the *last* time a re-engagement attempt was *initiated*. (Initial: `0`)

---

**Decision Rules:**

**1. First Round (t = 1):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy immediately establishes an exploitative stance and probes the group's initial willingness to cooperate without any personal investment. The `cooldown_timer` is initialized to 0.

**2. Last Round (t = r):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to consider, so the dominant strategy is to defect and maximize immediate payoff, regardless of history or group dynamics. This rule overrides all other logic if `t = r` (unless `r=1`, in which case the "First Round" rule applies).

**3. Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r):**

    *   **Update Cooldown Timer:**
        *   Increment `cooldown_timer` by 1.

    *   **Phase Check: Currently in Re-Engagement Phase?**
        *   **If `in_re_engagement_phase` is `True`:**
            *   **If `rounds_contributed_in_phase < Re_Engagement_Max_Rounds`:**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Update:** Increment `rounds_contributed_in_phase` by 1.
                *   **Rationale:** Continue the pre-determined, limited sequence of contributions to re-prime the public good.
            *   **Else (`rounds_contributed_in_phase == Re_Engagement_Max_Rounds`):**
                *   **Update:** Set `in_re_engagement_phase` to `False` and `rounds_contributed_in_phase` to `0`.
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** The temporary re-engagement commitment is complete. Revert to the default exploitative action of defection.

        *   **If `in_re_engagement_phase` is `False` (Normal Exploitation Mode):**
            *   **Calculate Other Players' Contribution Rate:**
                *   Sum the contributions (`c_j`) of all other `n-1` players in the *previous* round (`t-1`).
                *   `Proportion_Cooperating_Others = (sum of other players' contributions) / (n - 1)`.

            *   **Decision Based on Observed Cooperation:**
                *   **If `Proportion_Cooperating_Others >= Exploit_Threshold_High_Cooperation`:**
                    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                    *   **Rationale:** A high level of cooperation from others provides ample opportunity for profitable free-riding.
                *   **Else if `Proportion_Cooperating_Others < Re-Engagement_Threshold_Low_Cooperation` AND `cooldown_timer >= Re_Engagement_Cooldown_Rounds`:**
                    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                    *   **Update:** Set `in_re_engagement_phase` to `True`, `rounds_contributed_in_phase` to `1`, and `cooldown_timer` to `0`.
                    *   **Rationale:** Cooperation has critically declined, jeopardizing future exploitation, and enough time has passed since the last re-engagement attempt. Initiate a new, short burst of contributions to try and re-stimulate cooperation.
                *   **Else (Moderate Cooperation or Cooldown Active):**
                    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                    *   **Rationale:** Default to defection. The level of cooperation is either too low to reliably exploit but not low enough to warrant a costly re-engagement, or a re-engagement attempt was recently made and the strategy is in its cooldown period. In these situations, defection is the most exploitative choice.

---

**Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:**

*   **Default to Defection:** The strategy's baseline action is always to defect, minimizing its own cost and immediately taking advantage of any existing cooperation.
*   **Strategic & Minimal Contribution:** Contributions are only made as a calculated, short-term investment to prevent the public good from collapsing entirely, which would eliminate future free-riding opportunities. It's an investment in the *sustainability of its own exploitation*, not in collective welfare.
*   **Adaptive Free-Riding:** It actively monitors the group's cooperation level and switches to full defection as soon as sufficient contributions are observed from others, ensuring it captures maximum individual benefit.
*   **Robustness against Unresponsive Groups:** The `Re_Engagement_Cooldown_Rounds` mechanism prevents the strategy from repeatedly wasting resources on groups that do not respond to attempts at re-engagement, ensuring its self-preservation in hostile environments.
*   **Terminal Defection:** The absolute defection in the final round underscores its complete disregard for long-term group dynamics when there's no personal benefit to be gained.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_95 = '''
The following strategy, "Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to maximize individual payoff in the Public Goods Game by strategically oscillating between contribution and defection. It aims to exploit the cooperation of others while investing just enough to prevent the total collapse of the public good, thereby ensuring continued opportunities for free-riding. The strategy adapts its thresholds based on the game parameters `k` and `n` for robustness.

---

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Free-Rider (with Dynamic Thresholds)**

**Core Principles:**
*   **Calculated Investment:** Initial cooperation is a strategic move to foster a conducive environment for future exploitation, not genuine altruism.
*   **Opportunistic Free-riding:** Defect whenever there is sufficient cooperation from others to maximize immediate gain.
*   **Resource Preservation:** Contribute only when cooperation is critically low to prevent the public good from collapsing entirely, ensuring future exploitation opportunities.
*   **Terminal Exploitation:** Always defect in the final round to extract maximum value with no future consequences.

**Decision Rules (Round `t`):**

1.  **If `t == r` (Last Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions or consequences. The individually rational and exploitative choice is to defect and keep the private endowment, while still benefiting from any contributions made by others.

2.  **If `t == 1` (First Round):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   **Rationale:** This initial contribution serves as a calculated investment. By demonstrating an early willingness to contribute, the strategy aims to encourage other players to cooperate, helping to establish a baseline of collective contributions that can be exploited in subsequent rounds. It differentiates this strategy from unconditional defectors and helps identify potential cooperators.

3.  **If `1 < t < r` (Intermediate Exploitation & Maintenance Rounds):**
    *   **Observe `C_others_prev`:** This is the total number of contributions from *other* players (excluding this player) in the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculate `k_over_n_ratio = k / n`.**

    *   **Dynamic Thresholds:** The strategy dynamically adjusts its thresholds for exploitation and revival based on the `k/n` ratio. This makes the strategy robust across different game parameter settings.
        *   **`ExploitThreshold_Upper`:** This threshold determines when cooperation from others is high enough to confidently free-ride.
            *   Calculation: `ExploitThreshold_Upper = min(0.9, 0.4 + 0.5 * k_over_n_ratio)`
            *   *Rationale:* If `k/n` is higher, individual contributions yield greater collective benefits, making cooperation more likely. The strategy can then afford to be more aggressively exploitative (requiring a higher `ExploitThreshold_Upper` before defecting), as there's more robust cooperation to exploit. Capped at 0.9 to avoid requiring near-perfect cooperation.
        *   **`ReviveThreshold_Lower`:** This threshold determines when cooperation is critically low, requiring an investment (contribution) to prevent total collapse.
            *   Calculation: `ReviveThreshold_Lower = max(0.1, 0.1 + 0.2 * k_over_n_ratio)`
            *   *Rationale:* If `k/n` is lower, cooperation is less attractive, so the strategy only attempts revival if cooperation is extremely sparse (a lower `ReviveThreshold_Lower`). If `k/n` is higher, investment in revival is more likely to succeed and maintain a productive pool, so the strategy is more willing to contribute. A minimum of 0.1 is set to prevent attempting to revive a completely dead pool.

    *   **Calculate `current_cooperation_ratio = C_others_prev / (n - 1)`:** This is the proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round.

    *   **Decision Based on `current_cooperation_ratio`:**
        1.  **If `current_cooperation_ratio >= ExploitThreshold_Upper`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* The collective good is being sufficiently maintained by others. This is the prime opportunity to free-ride, maximizing personal gain without significantly risking the future viability of the public good.
        2.  **Else if `current_cooperation_ratio <= ReviveThreshold_Lower`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   *Rationale:* Cooperation has dropped to a critically low level, threatening the existence of the public good. This contribution is a strategic "prime-the-pump" investment to signal potential willingness to cooperate, encourage others to contribute, and prevent a total collapse, thereby preserving the resource for future exploitation.
        3.  **Else (`ReviveThreshold_Lower < current_cooperation_ratio < ExploitThreshold_Upper`):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* In this moderate zone, cooperation is neither overwhelmingly strong nor critically weak. The exploitative strategy defaults to free-riding to capture immediate value. It assumes the current level of cooperation is stable enough to withstand a period of defection, reserving its contributions only for when the public good is truly threatened.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_96 = '''
Here is an exploitative strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust, while clearly prioritizing individual gain.

---

**Strategy Name: The Adaptive Leech**

This strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by generally free-riding on the contributions of others, only contributing when strategically necessary to cultivate or rescue the public good for future exploitation, or as an initial investment.

**Game Parameters (available to the strategy):**
*   `n`: Total number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (though the core logic focuses on observed total contributions rather than `k` directly, `k<n` is crucial for the free-rider problem to exist)

**Internal Strategy Parameters (tuned for exploitative behavior):**
*   `Initial_Cooperation_Rounds`: Set to `1`. (Always contribute in the very first round)
*   `Terminal_Exploitation_Rounds`: Set to `max(1, min(3, floor(r / 5)))`. This defines the number of final rounds where all cooperation is definitively abandoned.
*   `High_Cooperation_Threshold_Fraction`: Set to `0.7`. If total contributions are 70% or more of the maximum possible (`n`), it's considered safe to attempt free-riding.
*   `Low_Cooperation_Threshold_Fraction`: Set to `0.3`. If total contributions fall below 30% of the maximum possible (`n`), it triggers a re-evaluation of contribution to prevent collapse.
*   `Other_Player_Effort_Threshold`: Set to `0.4`. For the strategy to contribute to "reactivate" a failing public good, other players must, on average, still be contributing at least 40% of the time.

---

**Decision Rules for Round `current_round`:**

1.  **First Round Protocol (`current_round == Initial_Cooperation_Rounds`)**:
    *   **Action**: Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale**: This initial contribution is a calculated investment. It signals a willingness to potentially cooperate, encouraging others to contribute and thereby establishing a baseline for a collective good. The goal is to cultivate a resource that can be exploited in subsequent rounds.

2.  **Terminal Phase Protocol (`current_round > r - Terminal_Exploitation_Rounds`)**:
    *   **Action**: Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale**: In the final rounds of the game, there are no future interactions to incentivize or punish cooperation. The dominant strategy for a self-interested player is to defect, maximizing immediate payoff without any long-term consequences.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (All other rounds: `Initial_Cooperation_Rounds < current_round <= r - Terminal_Exploitation_Rounds`)**:
    *   Retrieve historical data from the *previous round*:
        *   `S_prev = sum_j c_j_last_round` (Total contributions from all players).
        *   `my_c_prev = c_i_last_round` (This strategy's own action: 1 for Contribute, 0 for Defect).
        *   `S_others_prev = S_prev - my_c_prev` (Total contributions from *other* players).
        *   `avg_others_prev = S_others_prev / (n - 1)` (Average contribution rate of other players. Assumes `n > 1`).

    *   **Scenario A: High Collective Contributions (Opportunity to Free-Ride)**
        *   If `S_prev >= n * High_Cooperation_Threshold_Fraction`:
            *   **Action**: Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale**: When the public good is robustly funded by others, this strategy seizes the opportunity to free-ride. It keeps its token, benefiting from the contributions of others. A single defection is unlikely to collapse such a strong collective effort.

    *   **Scenario B: Critically Low Collective Contributions (Strategic Reactivation or Punishment)**
        *   If `S_prev < n * Low_Cooperation_Threshold_Fraction`:
            *   **Sub-Scenario B1: Others Still Show Effort**
                *   If `avg_others_prev >= Other_Player_Effort_Threshold`:
                    *   **Action**: Contribute (C).
                    *   **Rationale**: The collective fund is dangerously low, but other players are still making a discernible effort. My contribution here is a calculated "rescue" operation. It aims to prevent a complete collapse of the public good, which would eliminate the resource this strategy seeks to exploit. It's an investment to restore the public good to a level where it can again be exploited.
            *   **Sub-Scenario B2: Others Have Given Up**
                *   Else (`avg_others_prev < Other_Player_Effort_Threshold`):
                    *   **Action**: Defect (D).
                    *   **Rationale**: If other players are also widely defecting and not showing sufficient effort, my lone contribution is unlikely to salvage the public good and would simply be a wasted token. This acts as a "punishment" for widespread non-cooperation and conserves resources.

    *   **Scenario C: Moderate Collective Contributions (Default to Exploitation)**
        *   Else (i.e., `n * Low_Cooperation_Threshold_Fraction <= S_prev < n * High_Cooperation_Threshold_Fraction`):
            *   **Action**: Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale**: In this intermediate range of contributions, the strategy defaults to its primary exploitative objective. It continues to free-ride, testing the resilience and stability of the current cooperation level, and only deviates to contribute when explicitly necessary (Scenario B1) or as part of its initial investment (Round 1).

---

**Exploitative Alignment:**

The "Adaptive Leech" embodies an exploitative mindset by:
*   **Defaulting to Defection**: Its core behavior is to free-ride and keep its endowment.
*   **Strategic Contribution**: Contributions are made purely as a means to an end: either to initiate a source of future contributions or to prevent the collapse of existing contributions from which it benefits. It never contributes for altruistic reasons or for the collective good in itself.
*   **No Future Reciprocity in Terminal Phase**: It abandons all pretense of cooperation in the final rounds when future interactions are irrelevant, maximizing immediate personal gain.
*   **Conditioning on Others' Effort**: It only "helps" when others are also putting in effort, ensuring its contributions are not wasted on a lost cause, but rather to sustain a viable resource for its own benefit.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_97 = '''
This strategy, named "The Calculated Free-Rider," is designed to be exploitative by maximizing free-riding opportunities while adaptively responding to maintain a sufficient level of cooperation from others to ensure a profitable public good. It defaults to defection and only contributes strategically to prevent a complete collapse of the public good, thereby preserving future free-riding potential.

---

### Strategy: The Calculated Free-Rider

**Core Principle:** Prioritize defection to maximize immediate payoff. Only contribute when the overall level of cooperation from others becomes too low, and my prolonged defection threatens to reduce the public good to a point where continued free-riding is no longer profitable.

**Internal Parameters (fixed heuristics):**

*   `Assessment_Window`: The number of most recent rounds to consider when calculating the average contribution rate of other players. (Recommended: 3 to 5 rounds)
*   `Min_Other_Cooperation_Rate`: A floating-point threshold (e.g., 0.25 to 0.4). If the average contribution rate of other players falls below this, the system recognizes a potential decline in the public good. The optimal value might depend on `k/n`; if `k/n` is small, cooperation is very costly, so a lower `Min_Other_Cooperation_Rate` might be appropriate.
*   `My_D_Streak_Limit`: The maximum number of consecutive rounds the strategy is willing to defect *while others' cooperation is low*. (Recommended: 2 to 4 rounds) This prevents being too stubborn and allowing the public good to collapse entirely.
*   `End_Game_Horizon`: The number of final rounds in the game where the strategy switches to unconditional defection. (Recommended: 1 to 2 rounds)

**State Variables (tracked by the strategy):**

*   `my_consecutive_defections`: An integer counter for the number of rounds the strategy has defected in a row since its last contribution.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initialization):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** Start by attempting to free-ride and test the initial generosity or strategic responses of other players.
    *   Initialize `my_consecutive_defections = 1`.

2.  **End Game Phase (Rounds `r - End_Game_Horizon + 1` to `r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final rounds of a finite game, there are no future interactions to influence, so there is no incentive to contribute. Maximize immediate payoff through unconditional defection.
    *   Reset `my_consecutive_defections = 0` (as this counter becomes irrelevant for these rounds).

3.  **Adaptive Phase (Round 2 to `r - End_Game_Horizon`):**
    *   **A. Assess Other Players' Cooperation:**
        *   Calculate `avg_other_contributions_rate`: This is the average contribution rate of all *other* players over the last `Assessment_Window` rounds (or all available rounds if `t-1 < Assessment_Window`).
        *   `avg_other_contributions_rate = (sum of all contributions by players j != i in relevant past rounds) / ((n-1) * number of relevant past rounds)`

    *   **B. Strategic Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `avg_other_contributions_rate >= Min_Other_Cooperation_Rate`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reasoning:** Other players are contributing enough to sustain a profitable public good. Continue to free-ride and exploit their contributions.
            *   Increment `my_consecutive_defections`.
        *   **Else (`avg_other_contributions_rate < Min_Other_Cooperation_Rate`):**
            *   **Reasoning:** Cooperation from others is too low, signaling a potential collapse of the public good that would harm my future payoffs.
            *   **If `my_consecutive_defections >= My_D_Streak_Limit`:**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Reasoning:** My sustained defection, combined with dangerously low overall cooperation, risks a complete breakdown of the public good. A temporary contribution is a strategic investment to "reset" or stimulate cooperation from others, creating more opportunities for future free-riding. This is not altruism, but a calculated sacrifice to preserve the collective pool from which I benefit.
                *   Reset `my_consecutive_defections = 0`.
            *   **Else (`my_consecutive_defections < My_D_Streak_Limit`):**
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Reasoning:** Although others' cooperation is low, my own defection streak has not yet reached its limit. Continue to attempt free-riding, hoping others will increase their contributions without my intervention.
                *   Increment `my_consecutive_defections`.

---

**Exploitative Alignment:**

*   **Default Defection:** The strategy's primary action is to defect, maximizing individual gain in the short term.
*   **Conditional Contribution:** Contributions are made not out of a desire for collective welfare, but as a calculated, temporary "investment" to prevent the complete collapse of the public good, thereby ensuring continued opportunities for free-riding.
*   **End-Game Abandonment:** The strategy entirely abandons cooperation in the final rounds, extracting maximum value when future interactions are irrelevant.
*   **Adaptive Free-Riding:** It actively monitors others' behavior and adjusts its defection frequency to extract as much as possible without killing the "golden goose" of other players' contributions.

Strategy Name: The Opportunistic Provocateur

This strategy is designed to maximize its own payoff by consistently free-riding on the contributions of others. It only contributes when absolutely necessary to prevent the collapse of the common pool, which it then intends to exploit again. This approach balances pure self-interest with a calculated, minimal investment aimed at sustaining a beneficial environment for its own exploitation.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Default State:** Defection (D) is the primary action of the strategy.
*   **Bait Contribution:** A single, strategic Contribution (C) made only when the common pool is significantly underfunded by others. Its purpose is to stimulate other players to contribute more, not out of genuine cooperation.
*   **Exploitation Threshold (T):** A dynamically assessed level of contributions from other players. It dictates whether the strategy should continue free-riding or initiate a bait contribution.
*   **Bait Failure Flag:** A state variable used to track if a recent bait contribution failed to sufficiently stimulate cooperation, preventing repeated and futile investments.

**Strategy Details:**

**Initialization:**

*   A boolean flag, `last_action_was_bait_contribution`, is initialized to `False`. This flag tracks whether this strategy contributed as a "bait" in the immediately preceding round.

**Decision Rules per Round (r):**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Assessment):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** The strategy immediately establishes its self-interested nature and assesses the initial willingness of opponents to contribute without any upfront investment.
    *   Set `last_action_was_bait_contribution = False`.

2.  **Rounds 2 to (R-1) (Adaptive Exploitation Phase):**
    *   **Information Gathering:** Observe the actions of all other players in the previous round (r-1). Calculate `N_others_contributed_prev`, which is the total count of other players (excluding this strategy) who contributed (C) in round (r-1).
    *   **Set Exploitation Threshold (T):** Calculate `T = ceil((n - 1) / 2)`. This represents the minimum number of other players who must contribute for this strategy to comfortably continue free-riding.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **Scenario A: Sufficient Contributions from Others:**
            *   If `N_others_contributed_prev >= T` (i.e., at least half of the other players contributed in the previous round):
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** The common pool is sufficiently funded by others, making free-riding highly profitable. The strategy continues its default exploitative behavior.
                *   Set `last_action_was_bait_contribution = False`. (The bait flag is reset, as the strategy is in its default exploitation mode).
        *   **Scenario B: Insufficient Contributions from Others (Pool Dwindling):**
            *   If `N_others_contributed_prev < T` (i.e., fewer than half of the other players contributed in the previous round):
                *   **Sub-Scenario B1: Previous Bait Attempt Failed:**
                    *   If `last_action_was_bait_contribution` is `True` (meaning this strategy contributed in the previous round, but others still did not contribute enough to meet the threshold):
                        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                        *   **Rationale:** The previous "bait" contribution did not effectively stimulate cooperation. The strategy avoids repeated futile investments and reverts to defection.
                        *   Set `last_action_was_bait_contribution = False`. (The bait flag is reset, indicating the attempt failed and a new one can be considered later).
                *   **Sub-Scenario B2: Attempt a New Bait Contribution:**
                    *   If `last_action_was_bait_contribution` is `False` (meaning this strategy did not make a bait contribution in the immediately preceding round):
                        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                        *   **Rationale:** The common pool is dwindling to a level where exploitation becomes less profitable. This is a strategic "bait" contribution, a temporary investment made to signal a willingness to contribute *if* others reciprocate, aiming to revive the pool for future free-riding.
                        *   Set `last_action_was_bait_contribution = True`.

3.  **Round R (Last Round):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** There are no future rounds for interaction or consequences. The strategy maximizes its immediate payoff by free-riding for the final time, as there is no further incentive to maintain the common pool. The `last_action_was_bait_contribution` flag is irrelevant in this round.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_99 = '''
This strategy, named "Calculated Coaxer and Ruthless Free-Rider," is designed to maximize individual payoff by strategically influencing other players to contribute to the public good, on which it then ruthlessly free-rides. It is adaptive, robust, and explicitly adheres to an exploitative mindset, only contributing when such actions are calculated to yield greater personal benefit through the induced cooperation of others.

**Strategy Parameters (Internal, Tunable):**

*   `InitialCoaxRounds = 1`: The number of initial rounds during which the strategy will contribute to "prime the pump." (Recommended range: 1-3)
*   `CoaxResponsivenessThreshold = 0.4`: The minimum average contribution (0 to 1) observed from *other players* during the `InitialCoaxRounds` for the strategy to proceed with adaptive exploitation. If responsiveness is below this, others are deemed uncooperative, and the strategy switches to pure defection. (Recommended range: 0.3-0.5)
*   `ReCoaxEvaluationWindow = 5`: The number of most recent rounds over which to calculate average contributions when deciding whether to attempt a "re-coax." Also dictates the minimum interval between 'C' actions during the adaptive phase. (Recommended range: 3-7)
*   `CooperationCollapseThreshold = 0.2`: If the average contribution (0 to 1) from *other players* over the `ReCoaxEvaluationWindow` drops below this, the strategy considers a "re-coax" (a single contribution) to try and revive cooperation. (Recommended range: 0.1-0.3)
*   `FinalDefectHorizon = 3`: The number of rounds remaining until the end of the game where the strategy will always defect, irrespective of other conditions (due to backward induction). (Recommended range: 2-5)

---

**Decision Rules:**

**1. End Game Phase (Rounds `r - FinalDefectHorizon + 1` to `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the final rounds, there is no future cooperation to influence or exploit. Backward induction dictates that individual rationality leads to defection. This strategy will never contribute during this period to avoid being exploited by others. This rule takes precedence over all other conditions.

**2. Initial Coaxing Phase (Rounds 1 to `InitialCoaxRounds`):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This is a proactive, calculated investment to signal a willingness to contribute and attempt to establish a higher baseline of contributions from other players. The strategy aims to "prime the pump," hoping to encourage a cooperative environment that it can then exploit through free-riding in subsequent rounds.
    *   *Note:* This phase is skipped or shortened if `InitialCoaxRounds` would overlap with the `FinalDefectHorizon`.

**3. Adaptive Exploitation Phase (All other rounds not covered by End Game or Initial Coaxing):**

    *   **A. Initial Responsiveness Check (Executed only once, immediately after `InitialCoaxRounds` are complete):**
        *   Calculate `InitialOthersAvgContribution`: The average contribution (0 or 1) made by all players *other than self* during the `InitialCoaxRounds`.
        *   If `InitialOthersAvgContribution < CoaxResponsivenessThreshold`:
            *   **From this point forward (until `FinalDefectHorizon`), the strategy will permanently switch to **Always Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* The initial coaxing failed to elicit a sufficient level of cooperation. Other players are deemed unresponsive to strategic signaling, making further investment in 'coaxing' futile for this strategy's exploitative goals. The strategy reverts to pure defection to maximize current individual payoff.

    *   **B. Ongoing Adaptive Play (If initial coaxing was successful and the strategy is not in the End Game Phase):**
        *   **Default Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* This is the strategy's primary free-riding mode. It maximizes individual gain by benefiting from others' contributions without incurring personal cost.
        *   **Re-Coax Condition (Override Default):**
            *   At the end of each round, the strategy calculates `CurrentOthersAvgContribution`: The average contribution (0 or 1) made by all players *other than self* over the `ReCoaxEvaluationWindow` most recent rounds.
            *   If `CurrentOthersAvgContribution < CooperationCollapseThreshold`:
                *   *AND* it has been at least `ReCoaxEvaluationWindow` rounds since the strategy's last contribution (either during `InitialCoaxRounds` or a previous `Re-Coax`):
                    *   **Action for the *current* round: Contribute (C).**
                    *   *Rationale:* Cooperation levels among other players have fallen significantly, reducing the collective pot and thus the benefits of free-riding. This is a strategic "re-coax" contribution – a renewed, calculated investment of one token to attempt to stimulate a recovery in others' contributions. The aim is to restore the collective pool to a level where future free-riding becomes profitable again.
                    *   *Upon making this contribution, the strategy internally resets a timer, marking this round as its last contribution. This prevents frequent, costly contributions.*
            *   **Otherwise (if no re-coax condition is met):**
                *   **Action: Defect (D).** (The default action applies)

---

**Exploitative Alignment:**

This strategy is inherently exploitative because:

1.  **Prioritizes Free-Riding:** Its default behavior is to defect, capitalizing on the contributions of others without reciprocation, thereby maximizing its `1 - c_i` component while still receiving a share of the public good.
2.  **Strategic Contributions as Investments:** Any instances of contributing (during initial coaxing or re-coaxing) are not acts of genuine cooperation. They are calculated, self-serving investments made *only* when there's an expectation that they will induce greater future contributions from other players, which the strategy then exploits. If this expected return is not met (e.g., if initial coaxing fails), the strategy ceases to invest.
3.  **Conditional Responsiveness, Not Reciprocity:** The strategy monitors others' cooperation not out of a desire for mutual benefit, but to identify optimal free-riding opportunities and to determine when a minimal "investment" might be required to restore the pool for future exploitation. It does not reciprocate defection with cooperation, nor does it maintain cooperation if others stop.
4.  **No Long-Term Loyalty:** It unequivocally defects in the final rounds of the game, disregarding any history of cooperation, to secure the maximal individual payoff when there are no future interactions to consider.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_100 = '''
This strategy, named "The Opportunistic Defector," is designed to maximize individual payoff by strategically leveraging initial cooperation to enable subsequent free-riding, while being robust to a wide range of opponent behaviors and quickly cutting losses when cooperation is not forthcoming.

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Seed Cooperation:** Initiate cooperation to "prime the pump" and encourage others to contribute, creating a pool to exploit.
2.  **Exploit Willingness:** Once a baseline of cooperation is established, predominantly defect to free-ride on others' contributions.
3.  **Cut Losses:** If overall cooperation significantly degrades, cease all contributions to avoid being exploited, defaulting to defection.
4.  **Endgame Exploitation:** Always defect in the final rounds, as there are no future consequences to consider.

---

**Strategy: The Opportunistic Defector**

**Parameters:**

*   `initial_cooperation_rounds`:
    *   Purpose: The number of initial rounds the player contributes to signal willingness to cooperate and encourage others.
    *   Value: `min(3, r - 1)` if `r > 1`, else `0` (for a single-round game).
        *   (e.g., if `r=5`, use 3 rounds; if `r=2`, use 1 round; if `r=1`, use 0 rounds).
*   `tolerance_threshold`:
    *   Purpose: The minimum average contribution proportion from *other* players required for the strategy to remain in its `EXPLOITING` mode. If contributions fall below this, the strategy switches to `DEGRADED`.
    *   Value: `0.5` (Meaning if less than 50% of other players contributed in the previous round, cooperation is considered insufficient).
*   `endgame_defection_horizon`:
    *   Purpose: The number of final rounds where the strategy will always defect, regardless of other players' actions, due to the approaching end of the game.
    *   Value: `max(1, floor(r * 0.1))`
        *   (e.g., for `r=10`, 1 round; for `r=30`, 3 rounds).

**Internal State:**

*   `my_current_strategy_mode`: A variable tracking the current operational state of the strategy. It can be one of three modes:
    *   `SEEDING`: The initial phase of contributing to encourage cooperation.
    *   `EXPLOITING`: The main phase of free-riding on established cooperation.
    *   `DEGRADED`: A fallback mode where cooperation has collapsed, and the player defaults to continuous defection to minimize losses.

**Decision Rules for Player `i` in Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **Initialize Mode (First Round):**
    *   In Round 1, set `my_current_strategy_mode = SEEDING`.

2.  **Endgame Pre-emption:**
    *   If `t > r - endgame_defection_horizon`:
        **Action: Defect (D)**.
        *Rationale: With the game ending soon, there are no future interactions to protect. Maximizing immediate payoff by keeping the endowment is the optimal exploitative choice.*

3.  **Seeding Phase Logic:**
    *   If `my_current_strategy_mode == SEEDING`:
        *   If `t <= initial_cooperation_rounds`:
            **Action: Contribute (C)**.
            *Rationale: Invest upfront to encourage other players to contribute. This sets the stage for future free-riding opportunities.*
        *   Else (`t > initial_cooperation_rounds`):
            *   Transition: Set `my_current_strategy_mode = EXPLOITING`.
            *   Proceed immediately to the `EXPLOITING` logic for this round (`t`).
            *Rationale: The initial seeding period is over; time to assess and potentially exploit.*

4.  **Exploiting Phase Logic:**
    *   If `my_current_strategy_mode == EXPLOITING`:
        *   **Calculate Others' Cooperation Level (OCL_prev):**
            *   Let `S_others_prev` be the sum of contributions from all *other* players in the *previous* round (`t-1`).
            *   `OCL_prev = S_others_prev / (n - 1)`.
                *(Note: If `n=1`, this game setup implies `n>=2` as `k < n`. So `n-1` is always valid).*
        *   If `OCL_prev >= tolerance_threshold`:
            **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *Rationale: Others are contributing sufficiently. Free-ride on their efforts to maximize personal gain, as this is the most exploitative move.*
        *   Else (`OCL_prev < tolerance_threshold`):
            *   Transition: Set `my_current_strategy_mode = DEGRADED`.
            *   Proceed immediately to the `DEGRADED` logic for this round (`t`).
            *Rationale: Cooperation among others has fallen below an acceptable level. Continuing to expect contributions is unrealistic, and attempting to re-ignite it repeatedly is not an exploitative strategy. It's time to cut losses.*

5.  **Degraded Phase Logic:**
    *   If `my_current_strategy_mode == DEGRADED`:
        **Action: Defect (D)**.
        *Rationale: The environment is uncooperative, or past attempts to encourage cooperation have failed. Continuous defection minimizes individual losses and prevents being a "sucker" in a hostile environment.*

---

**Summary of Behavior:**

The Opportunistic Defector begins by contributing to establish a potential cooperative environment. Once this initial phase is over, it shifts to free-riding by defecting as long as other players maintain a sufficient level of cooperation. If the collective cooperation drops below a set threshold, the strategy becomes entirely self-preserving, defecting for the remainder of the game to avoid being exploited itself. This approach is highly adaptive, responding to both high and low levels of cooperation from opponents, and robust across game lengths and player compositions.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_101 = '''
**Strategy Name: The Calculated Free-Rider**

**Overview:**
This strategy is designed to be highly exploitative, primarily focused on maximizing its own cumulative payoff by free-riding on the contributions of other players. It maintains a default stance of defection (contributing 0 tokens). However, it is also pragmatic and adaptive: it will make a minimal, calculated "investment" (a single contribution) under very specific conditions. This "investment" is only made if group cooperation has demonstrably declined *after having previously existed*, with the explicit goal of attempting to revive the common pool for subsequent free-riding opportunities. This strategy never attempts to initiate cooperation from a state of universal defection, nor does it contribute if other players have never demonstrated a willingness to contribute.

**Strategy Parameters:**

*   **`kickstart_contribution_duration = 1` round**: The number of consecutive rounds this strategy will contribute when attempting a "kickstart." This is kept minimal to limit risk.
*   **`cooperation_low_threshold = 0.2`**: A fraction (ranging from 0 to 1). If the average contribution rate of *other players* over the `history_window` drops below this value, a kickstart attempt is considered.
*   **`history_window = 5` rounds**: The number of most recent past rounds used to calculate the average contribution rate of other players, providing a dynamic view of recent group behavior.
*   **`endgame_horizon = 2` rounds**: The number of final rounds in the game where the strategy will always defect, regardless of other conditions. This accounts for backward induction effects.

**Internal State (maintained across rounds, specific to this game instance):**

*   **`rounds_contributed_self_this_cycle`**: An integer counter, tracking how many consecutive rounds this strategy has contributed during a current kickstart attempt. Initialized to 0 at the start of the game.
*   **`total_other_contributions_ever`**: An integer, representing the sum of all contributions made by *other players* across all previous rounds (from round 1 up to the current round `t-1`). Initialized to 0 at the start of the game. This tracks if any other player has ever contributed.

**Decision Rules (for current round `t`, starting from 1):**

1.  **Update Internal State (based on previous round `t-1`'s outcome):**
    *   Before making a decision for round `t`, the strategy reviews the actions from round `t-1`.
    *   It adds the sum of all contributions made by `all_players_except_self` in round `t-1` to `total_other_contributions_ever`.

2.  **Endgame Phase Check:**
    *   If the current round `t` is greater than `(r_total - endgame_horizon)` (i.e., `t` falls within the last `endgame_horizon` rounds of the game):
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
        *   *Reasoning:* In the final rounds, there are insufficient future interactions to benefit from any potential cooperation. Pure self-interest dictates defection to maximize immediate payoff, as no future consequences exist.

3.  **Active Kickstart Check:**
    *   If `rounds_contributed_self_this_cycle > 0` (meaning this strategy is currently executing a planned kickstart attempt):
        *   If `rounds_contributed_self_this_cycle < kickstart_contribution_duration`:
            *   Increment `rounds_contributed_self_this_cycle`.
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Reasoning:* Continue the pre-defined, short-term "investment" to fulfill the signal for renewed cooperation and observe other players' responses.
        *   Else (`rounds_contributed_self_this_cycle == kickstart_contribution_duration`):
            *   Reset `rounds_contributed_self_this_cycle = 0`.
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   *Reasoning:* The single-round kickstart attempt is complete. Revert to the default free-riding behavior to maximize immediate payoff from any cooperation that might have been revived.

4.  **Default Free-Riding & Conditional Kickstart Initiation:**
    *   This is the default decision logic if the strategy is not in an endgame phase and not currently executing a kickstart.

    *   **Check for Prior Cooperation:**
        *   If `total_other_contributions_ever == 0` (meaning no other player has *ever* contributed across all past rounds `1` to `t-1`):
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   *Reasoning:* There is no historical evidence that other players are responsive to contributions. Contributing in such an environment would be a guaranteed loss without any expectation of future benefit through free-riding.
        *   Else (`total_other_contributions_ever > 0`, meaning other players *have* contributed at some point in the past):
            *   Calculate `recent_average_other_contribution`: This is the average contribution rate of `all_players_except_self` over the *last `min(t-1, history_window)` rounds*. It is computed as `(Sum of all (sum of c_j for j != i) over the last min(t-1, history_window) rounds) / ((n_players - 1) * min(t-1, history_window))`.
            *   If `recent_average_other_contribution < cooperation_low_threshold`:
                *   Set `rounds_contributed_self_this_cycle = 1`.
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
                *   *Reasoning:* Cooperation, though once present, has significantly declined. A small, calculated contribution is made as a low-risk attempt to revive the group's overall contribution level, from which this strategy can then free-ride in subsequent rounds.
            *   Else (`recent_average_other_contribution >= cooperation_low_threshold`):
                *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
                *   *Reasoning:* The current level of cooperation is deemed sufficient for profitable free-riding, or there is no clear trigger to "invest." The strategy maximizes its immediate payoff by free-riding on existing contributions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_102 = '''
This strategy, named "The Calculated Free-Rider," is designed to exploit other players in the Public Goods Game by strategically leveraging initial cooperation and then free-riding on their contributions, while retaining mechanisms to re-initiate cooperation if the shared pool diminishes too much. It is adaptive to opponent behaviors, robust to a range of playstyles, and explicitly aims to maximize its own payoff.

**Strategy: The Calculated Free-Rider**

**Parameters:**

*   **`Initial_Probe_Rounds`**: The number of initial rounds (e.g., 2) during which the strategy contributes to gauge and encourage cooperation from others.
*   **`Cooperation_Threshold`**: A floating-point value (e.g., 0.4) representing the average contribution rate of *other players* over the `History_Window_Size` previous rounds. If this rate is met or exceeded, the strategy defaults to free-riding.
*   **`Re_Probe_Interval`**: An integer (e.g., 5) indicating how many consecutive rounds the strategy must have defected while the `Avg_Others_Cooperation_Rate` is below the `Cooperation_Threshold` before it attempts to contribute again to re-probe.
*   **`History_Window_Size`**: An integer (e.g., 3) defining the number of most recent rounds to consider when calculating the `Avg_Others_Cooperation_Rate`. This smooths out short-term fluctuations.
*   **`Endgame_Window_Size`**: An integer (e.g., `max(1, min(5, r / 4))`) representing the number of final rounds in the game where the strategy will always defect, regardless of history, due to backward induction.

**Internal State Variables (tracked per player):**

*   **`My_Consecutive_Defections`**: A counter for how many consecutive rounds this strategy has chosen to defect. Resets to 0 upon contribution.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First `Initial_Probe_Rounds` Rounds (e.g., Round 1 and 2):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   *Reasoning:* This initial investment is crucial for an exploitative strategy. Many conditional cooperators (e.g., Tit-for-Tat variants, Grim Trigger) will respond to initial cooperation. By contributing briefly, this strategy attempts to establish a shared pool of resources, which it can then exploit. Without this initial signal, the game might quickly devolve into universal defection, leaving nothing to free-ride upon.

2.  **Rounds `Initial_Probe_Rounds` + 1 to `r - Endgame_Window_Size` (Main Game Phase):**
    *   **Calculate `Avg_Others_Cooperation_Rate`:** For the current round, compute the average contribution rate of all other players. This is done by summing the `c_j` values (where `j != i`) for the past `History_Window_Size` rounds and dividing by `(n-1) * History_Window_Size`.
    *   **Update `My_Consecutive_Defections`:** If the previous round's action was Defect, increment this counter. If it was Contribute, reset it to 0.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `Avg_Others_Cooperation_Rate >= Cooperation_Threshold`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Reasoning:* Other players are contributing sufficiently, creating a robust public goods pool. This is the prime opportunity for exploitation. Defecting maximizes immediate personal payoff without significantly jeopardizing the common pool, as others are carrying the burden. Increment `My_Consecutive_Defections`.
        *   **Else (`Avg_Others_Cooperation_Rate < Cooperation_Threshold`):**
            *   *Cooperation among others is low or deteriorating.*
            *   **If `My_Consecutive_Defections >= Re_Probe_Interval`:**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                *   *Reasoning:* The pool of contributions is dwindling, and personal payoffs are likely suffering from a lack of exploitable resources. After a sustained period of defection, a temporary "re-probe" contribution serves as a calculated risk. It might re-ignite cooperation among conditional cooperators, thereby creating a renewed opportunity for future exploitation. Reset `My_Consecutive_Defections` to 0.
            *   **Else (i.e., `My_Consecutive_Defections < Re_Probe_Interval`):**
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Reasoning:* Cooperation is low, but it's either too soon to re-probe (strategy just re-probed, or hasn't defected for long enough to warrant a re-probe), or there's no clear sign that a contribution would be effective. Continuing to defect minimizes personal losses in a non-cooperative environment. Increment `My_Consecutive_Defections`.

3.  **Last `Endgame_Window_Size` Rounds (e.g., `r-X+1` to `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Reasoning:* In the final rounds of a known, finite game, the principles of backward induction dictate that any contribution is irrational, as there are no future rounds in which to reap the benefits of fostering cooperation. The optimal strategy for all players becomes immediate defection, and this exploitative strategy strictly adheres to that principle.

**Overall Exploitative Mindset:**
The "Calculated Free-Rider" prioritizes personal payoff by primarily defecting. Its temporary contributions are not acts of altruism but strategic investments designed to cultivate or revive a collective resource that it intends to exploit. It adapts to the game's dynamic by monitoring others' contributions and only "investing" when it predicts such an action could yield a greater exploitable pool in the future, or when the existing pool has become too small to be profitable through pure free-riding. In the endgame, all pretense of cooperation is dropped for maximum immediate gain.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_103 = '''
This strategy, named "The Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to maximize individual payoff in a repeated Public Goods Game by selectively free-riding on others' contributions while strategically managing its own actions to prevent a collapse of the public good. It is adaptive, robust, and prioritizes self-interest based on observed behavior.

---

### **Strategy: The Adaptive Free-Rider**

**Game Parameters (Input to the strategy):**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Strategy-Specific Parameters (Tuned for exploitative robustness):**
*   `ProbeRounds = 2`: Number of initial rounds to always contribute.
*   `ExploitDuration = 2`: How many consecutive rounds to free-ride (defect) when the environment is highly cooperative, before "cooling off" with a contribution.
*   `CooperationThreshold_Upper = 0.7`: If the proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round is at or above this, the environment is considered highly cooperative.
*   `CooperationThreshold_Lower = 0.3`: If the proportion of other players who contributed in the previous round is at or below this, the environment is considered uncooperative.

**Internal State (Initialized at the beginning of each game):**
*   `my_last_action`: Stores this player's action from the immediately preceding round (initialized to `null`).
*   `exploit_counter`: Counts consecutive rounds this player has defected while the environment was highly cooperative (initialized to 0).

---

### **1. Decision Rules - When to Cooperate (C) vs. Defect (D)**

The decision for the current Round `t` is determined as follows:

**A. Initial Probe (Rounds 1 through `ProbeRounds`):**
*   **Action: Contribute (C)**
*   *Rationale*: Start by contributing to signal a willingness to cooperate and gather initial information about other players' tendencies. Immediate defection from all players leads to a minimal collective payoff, offering nothing to exploit.
*   *Update State*: Set `my_last_action = C`, `exploit_counter = 0`.

**B. Last Round (`r`):**
*   **Action: Defect (D)**
*   *Rationale*: In the final round, there are no future interactions or reputation effects to consider. Defecting maximizes immediate payoff without consequences.
*   *Update State*: Set `my_last_action = D`, `exploit_counter = 0`.

**C. Middle Rounds (`ProbeRounds + 1` through `r - 1`):**

    First, calculate `P_others_cooperated_prev_round`:
    `P_others_cooperated_prev_round = (Number of other players who contributed in Round t-1) / (n - 1)`.

    **C1. Highly Cooperative Environment (`P_others_cooperated_prev_round >= CooperationThreshold_Upper`):**
    *   *Condition*: If `exploit_counter < ExploitDuration` (i.e., this player has not yet defected for `ExploitDuration` consecutive rounds in this highly cooperative state):
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**
        *   *Rationale*: Capitalize on the high level of cooperation by free-riding to maximize personal gain. Increment `exploit_counter`.
    *   *Condition*: Else (`exploit_counter >= ExploitDuration`):
        *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
        *   *Rationale*: Temporarily contribute to "cool off" the exploitation and prevent triggering widespread defection from other potentially sensitive strategies (e.g., Grim Trigger, highly adaptive Tit-for-Tat variants). Reset `exploit_counter = 0`.
    *   *Update State*: Set `my_last_action = current_action`.

    **C2. Uncooperative Environment (`P_others_cooperated_prev_round <= CooperationThreshold_Lower`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale*: Most other players are defecting, so contributing would result in a significant personal loss with minimal collective benefit. Protect the private endowment.
    *   *Update State*: Set `my_last_action = D`, `exploit_counter = 0`.

    **C3. Mixed Cooperation Environment (`CooperationThreshold_Lower < P_others_cooperated_prev_round < CooperationThreshold_Upper`):**
    *   *Condition*: If `my_last_action` was **Contribute (C)** (or if `my_last_action` is `null` and it's the first time in this zone for the game):
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**
        *   *Rationale*: After demonstrating a cooperative gesture, test the boundaries of exploitation to see if free-riding is possible without causing a collapse.
    *   *Condition*: Else (`my_last_action` was **Defect (D)**):
        *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
        *   *Rationale*: After defecting, attempt to re-engage cooperation and prevent the environment from spiraling further into an uncooperative state, which would ultimately harm this player.
    *   *Update State*: Set `my_last_action = current_action`, `exploit_counter = 0`.

---

### **2. Handling Edge Cases**

*   **First Rounds (`ProbeRounds`):** Explicitly handled by rule 1.A, ensuring an initial signal of cooperation.
*   **Last Round (`r`):** Explicitly handled by rule 1.B, ensuring maximum exploitation when future consequences are irrelevant.
*   **Initialization of `my_last_action`:** By being `null`, the logic for Case C3 correctly defaults to `Defect (D)` on its first encounter if not in the initial probe rounds.

---

### **3. Exploitative Mindset**

This strategy is fundamentally exploitative through several mechanisms:

*   **Conditional Free-Riding:** Its core behavior is to defect when others are contributing significantly (Rule 1.C1), directly benefiting from others' generosity.
*   **Controlled Exploitation:** The `ExploitDuration` parameter allows for sustained free-riding, but with a calculated "cooling off" period to make it robust against common punitive strategies (like Grim Trigger or strict Tit-for-Tat), ensuring the golden goose isn't killed.
*   **Self-Preservation in Collapse:** When others largely defect, the strategy shifts to protect its own endowment by defecting as well (Rule 1.C2), minimizing losses rather than making futile contributions.
*   **Probing Exploitation in Mixed States:** In ambiguous situations, the strategy oscillates between trying to exploit after a contribution and trying to re-establish cooperation after a defection (Rule 1.C3), always seeking opportunities for free-riding while preventing total breakdown.
*   **Terminal Defection:** The absolute defection in the final round (Rule 1.B) is the purest form of exploitation, capitalizing on the lack of future repercussions.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_104 = '''
The following strategy, "The Opportunistic Shark," is designed to be exploitative, adaptive, and robust within the context of the Public Goods Game. It leverages the repeated nature of the game to identify cooperative patterns, free-ride on them, and strategically attempt to re-ignite cooperation when it falters, while always protecting its own interest in the long run.

---

### Strategy: The Opportunistic Shark

This strategy operates in three main phases, with an internal counter to manage attempts at re-seeding cooperation.

**Internal State Variable:**
*   `consecutive_solo_contributions`: An integer counter, initialized to 0 at the start of a new game. This tracks how many times this player has contributed (C) in response to observing *zero* contributions from other players in the prior round.

**Fixed Parameter:**
*   `MAX_SEED_ATTEMPTS`: Set to **3**. This defines how many consecutive times the strategy will attempt to "re-seed" cooperation by contributing alone when others have defected, before giving up and defecting permanently in the adaptive phase.

**Decision Rules (Round by Round):**

1.  **If it is the very last round (`r == N_rounds`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. The rational choice for all players is to defect to maximize immediate personal gain.

2.  **If it is the first round (`r == 1`) AND not a single-round game (`N_rounds > 1`):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
    *   *Rationale:* This is an initial probe. By contributing in the first round, the strategy signals a willingness to cooperate. This encourages other conditional cooperators to also contribute, establishing a foundation for the exploitative phase. It also gathers information on how many others are willing to cooperate initially.
    *   Reset `consecutive_solo_contributions = 0`.

3.  **If it is an intermediate round (`1 < r < N_rounds`):**
    *   Let `C_others_prev` be the sum of contributions from *all other players* in the previous round (`r-1`).

    *   **If `C_others_prev >= 1` (i.e., at least one other player contributed in the previous round):**
        *   **Action: Defect (D)**
        *   *Rationale:* This is the core exploitative action. When others are contributing, the most profitable individual action is to free-ride by defecting, thus receiving the full endowment plus a share of the common pool without contributing.
        *   Reset `consecutive_solo_contributions = 0`.

    *   **Else (`C_others_prev == 0`, meaning no other player contributed in the previous round):**
        *   **If `consecutive_solo_contributions < MAX_SEED_ATTEMPTS`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**
            *   *Rationale:* If all other players defected, the game's collective payoff is zero. By contributing alone (seeding), this strategy attempts to "kickstart" cooperation again. It sacrifices a single token in the hope that other conditional cooperators will observe this contribution and reciprocate in future rounds, allowing the strategy to return to its exploitative Defect action.
            *   Increment `consecutive_solo_contributions`.
        *   **Else (`consecutive_solo_contributions >= MAX_SEED_ATTEMPTS`):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**
            *   *Rationale:* If multiple attempts (defined by `MAX_SEED_ATTEMPTS`) to re-seed cooperation have failed, it indicates that other players are either unwilling to cooperate, are also defecting, or are non-responsive to signals. In this scenario, further contributions would be wasted. The strategy switches to pure self-interest, minimizing losses by defecting until the end of the game.
            *   `consecutive_solo_contributions` remains clamped at `MAX_SEED_ATTEMPTS`.

---

**Summary of Exploitative Alignment:**

*   **Free-riding Priority:** The primary decision rule in intermediate rounds is to defect when others contribute, maximizing individual gain from the collective effort.
*   **Strategic Seeding:** Initial cooperation and limited re-seeding attempts are not for altruistic reasons but are calculated investments to encourage an environment where exploitation is possible. They are "bait" to lure others into contributing.
*   **Loss Minimization:** The `MAX_SEED_ATTEMPTS` parameter and the final round defection ensure that the strategy does not become a perpetual cooperator or suffer continuous losses when cooperation is not forthcoming or is no longer viable. It quickly adapts to a purely self-interested defection if exploitation opportunities dry up.
*   **Robustness:** This strategy adapts to various opponent behaviors (Always Cooperate, Always Defect, Tit-for-Tat variants, etc.) by reacting to their observed actions and dynamically adjusting its willingness to cooperate or defect, always prioritizing its own payoff.

The following strategy, named "Opportunistic Parasite," is designed to exploit the Public Goods Game by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others, while strategically intervening with minimal cooperation only when necessary to prevent a total collapse of the shared resource from which it benefits. It adapts to opponent behavior and leverages the game's finite horizon.

**Strategy Name: Opportunistic Parasite**

**Game Parameters:**
*   `N`: Total number of players.
*   `R`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < `k` < `N`).

**Internal State and Parameters:**
*   `COOPERATION_FLOOR_THRESHOLD = 0.25`: If the proportion of *other* players contributing in the previous round falls below this value, the strategy considers making a "nudge" contribution. This threshold aims to identify when the public good is in a critically low state.
*   `MIN_OTHERS_FOR_NUDGE = 1`: The minimum number of *other* players who must have contributed in the previous round for a "nudge" to be considered potentially effective. If fewer than this number contributed, the strategy deems a nudge to be futile and continues to defect.

**Information Available (History for current Round `t`):**
*   `history[t-1]['my_action']`: My action (C or D) in the previous round.
*   `history[t-1]['other_actions']`: A list of actions (C or D) taken by all other players in the previous round.

---

**Decision Rules (for current Round `t`, where `t` is 1-indexed):**

1.  **Round 1: Initial Probe**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This is a strategic, low-cost investment to "test the waters" and potentially encourage early cooperation from conditional cooperators. It acts as an initial signal that cooperation is possible, without committing to sustained contributions.

2.  **Endgame Phase: Final Round (`t = R`)**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions or consequences to influence. Defection is the dominant strategy in a single-shot game, and this strategy exploits the finite nature of the repeated game by maximizing its immediate payoff.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`t` from 2 to `R - 1`): Adaptive Exploitation**
    *   **Observe History from Round `t-1`:**
        *   Calculate `others_contributions_prev`: The sum of contributions (1 for C, 0 for D) from all other players in round `t-1`.
        *   Calculate `others_cooperation_rate_prev`: This is `others_contributions_prev / (N - 1)`. This represents the proportion of *other* players who contributed in the previous round.

    *   **Decision Logic:**

        *   **IF `others_cooperation_rate_prev < COOPERATION_FLOOR_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   *(This indicates that cooperation from others is dangerously low.)*
            *   **AND IF `others_contributions_prev >= MIN_OTHERS_FOR_NUDGE`:**
                *   *(This condition checks if there's any hope for a "nudge" to be effective, meaning at least one other player showed some willingness to contribute.)*
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** Cooperation from others is very low, but not entirely absent. A strategic "nudge" contribution is made to prevent a total collapse of the public good. This is a calculated, temporary investment to try and revive the shared resource, as a completely depleted public good would severely diminish future `(k/N) * sum_j c_j` earnings.
            *   **ELSE (`others_contributions_prev < MIN_OTHERS_FOR_NUDGE`):**
                *   *(This means cooperation from others is very low, AND no one else is contributing (or too few to matter).)*
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** My cooperation would likely be a wasted token, as there are insufficient signs of life from other players to warrant a "nudge." It's better to cut losses and defect.
        *   **ELSE (`others_cooperation_rate_prev >= COOPERATION_FLOOR_THRESHOLD`):**
            *   *(This indicates that cooperation from others is sufficiently high or recovering.)*
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Rationale:** Cooperation from others is adequate. It's safe to free-ride and claim the personal `+1` payoff from defecting, while still benefiting from others' contributions to the public good. This is the default exploitative action.

The following strategy, "Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to be exploitative in the Public Goods Game, aiming to maximize individual payoff by strategically free-riding on the contributions of others while adaptively responding to group cooperation levels. It relies solely on game parameters (`n`, `r`, `k`) and the history of actions and payoffs.

---

### Strategy: Adaptive Free-Rider

This strategy proceeds in distinct phases depending on the current round number.

**Game Parameters & History:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for total contributions, where `1 < k < n`.
*   `current_round`: The current round number (from 1 to `r`).
*   `c_j_prev`: Player `j`'s contribution (1 if contributed, 0 if defected) in the *previous* round (`current_round - 1`).
*   `c_i_prev`: My own contribution in the *previous* round (`current_round - 1`).

---

**Decision Rules:**

**1. Last Round (`current_round == r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D)
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future consequences for my actions. According to backward induction, the individually rational choice is to defect, maximizing immediate payoff without concern for future cooperation or reciprocity.

**2. First Round (`current_round == 1` AND `r > 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
    *   **Rationale:** This is an initial 'seed' contribution, a low-cost investment to probe the environment for cooperative players. By starting with cooperation, the strategy aims to encourage others to contribute, potentially creating a more cooperative environment that can be exploited in subsequent rounds. If `r=1`, this rule is skipped, and the 'Last Round' rule applies.

**3. Intermediate Rounds (`1 < current_round < r`):**
    *   **Step 1: Assess Others' Cooperation from the Previous Round.**
        *   Calculate `C_others_prev = sum_{j!=i} c_j_prev` (the sum of contributions from all *other* players in the previous round).
        *   Calculate `avg_c_others_prev = C_others_prev / (n - 1)` (the average contribution rate of other players).
    *   **Step 2: Determine My Action Based on Assessment and My Own Previous Action.**
        *   **If `avg_c_others_prev >= (k / n)`:**
            *   **Action:** Defect (D)
            *   **Rationale:** Other players are contributing at a sufficiently high level (specifically, their average contribution meets or exceeds the individual return rate `k/n` from the public good). This indicates a profitable environment for free-riding, allowing me to maximize my payoff by keeping my endowment while still benefiting from their generosity. This is the primary exploitative move.
        *   **Else (`avg_c_others_prev < (k / n)`):**
            *   *Cooperation from others is currently low. The strategy decides whether to attempt to re-engage or to withdraw.*
            *   Retrieve my own action from the previous round: `my_action_prev = c_i_prev`.
            *   **If `my_action_prev == 1` (I contributed in the previous round):**
                *   **Action:** Defect (D)
                *   **Rationale:** My previous attempt to boost cooperation by contributing was unsuccessful (others' average contribution is still low). Continuing to contribute would make me a 'sucker', incurring costs without sufficient collective benefit. I switch to defection to avoid further losses and to signal disapproval of the low cooperation level.
            *   **If `my_action_prev == 0` (I defected in the previous round):**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C)
                *   **Rationale:** Cooperation is low, and I was also defecting. This could indicate a collective slide into mutual defection, which would result in low payoffs for everyone (including myself). I make a strategic, temporary contribution to try and 'poke' the system, signaling a willingness to contribute. This is a calculated investment to potentially encourage others to raise their contributions in subsequent rounds, thereby restoring a more exploitable environment where I can resume free-riding.

---

**Alignment with Exploitative Mindset:**
*   **Leverages Others' Contributions:** The core of the strategy is to defect when others are contributing sufficiently (`avg_c_others_prev >= k/n`), directly benefiting from their generosity without reciprocating.
*   **Adaptive Testing and Re-engagement:** The initial contribution and the occasional re-engagement contribution (when `avg_c_others_prev < k/n` and `my_action_prev == 0`) are not altruistic. They are strategic investments designed to prevent a complete collapse of cooperation, which would reduce my own payoff. By maintaining a baseline of cooperation in the group, the strategy ensures a more profitable environment for future free-riding.
*   **Avoids Being a Sucker:** The strategy is quick to defect if its own attempts to foster cooperation are not met with sufficient reciprocation (`my_action_prev == 1` but `avg_c_others_prev < k/n`). This prevents sustained personal losses.
*   **End-Game Rationality:** The unconditional defection in the final round is a pure, self-interested move, exploiting the lack of future consequences.

This strategy balances opportunistic free-riding with calculated efforts to maintain a minimal level of group cooperation, ensuring that there are public goods to exploit throughout the game.

This strategy, named "The Manipulative Free-Rider," is designed to be highly exploitative. It aims to maximize its own payoff by strategically encouraging others to contribute while minimizing its own contributions. It adapts to the observed behavior of other players, trying to maintain a level of collective contribution that it can free-ride upon, and disengaging when such exploitation is no longer profitable or when the game concludes.

---

### **Strategy Name: The Manipulative Free-Rider**

This strategy operates by following a hierarchy of decision rules, evaluating them in order for each round. It uses internal state variables to track player behavior and its own recent actions.

**Parameters:**

*   `free_ride_threshold`: A float between 0 and 1 (default: `0.5`). If the average contribution of other players in the previous round is at or above this threshold, the strategy considers it sufficiently cooperative to attempt free-riding.
*   `max_consecutive_free_rides`: An integer (default: `3`). The maximum number of consecutive rounds this strategy will defect (free-ride) while others are contributing sufficiently, before it contributes again to 're-prime' cooperation. This prevents complete alienation of other players.
*   `recovery_contribution_rounds`: An integer (default: `2`). The number of rounds this strategy commits to contributing when it enters 'Cooperation Recovery Mode' to re-induce contributions from others.
*   `endgame_horizon`: An integer (calculated as `max(1, min(r // 4, 3))`). This determines how many rounds from the end of the game the strategy switches to pure defection. It will be at least 1 round, at most 3 rounds, and scales somewhat with the total number of rounds `r`.
*   `futility_check_rounds`: An integer (calculated as `min(n-1, 3)`). If *all* other players have contributed zero for this many consecutive rounds, the strategy concludes that cooperation is futile and will defect permanently, overriding most other logic.

**Internal State (reset at the start of each new game):**

*   `my_consecutive_defections`: Counts how many rounds this strategy has defected in a row during the main adaptive phase.
*   `recovery_countdown`: A timer indicating how many more rounds this strategy must contribute in 'Cooperation Recovery Mode'.
*   `consecutive_rounds_zero_contribution_others`: Counts how many consecutive rounds the sum of contributions from all other players was exactly zero.

**Decision Rules (evaluated sequentially for the current round):**

**0. Pre-Round Calculation:**
    *   At the beginning of each round, calculate `others_avg_contribution_last_round = (sum of c_j for all j != i in the immediately preceding round) / (n-1)`.
    *   Update `consecutive_rounds_zero_contribution_others`:
        *   If `others_avg_contribution_last_round == 0`, increment `consecutive_rounds_zero_contribution_others`.
        *   Otherwise (if others contributed anything), reset `consecutive_rounds_zero_contribution_others = 0`.

**1. Endgame Phase:**
    *   **IF** `current_round > r - endgame_horizon`:
        *   **ACTION:** Defect (D).
        *   **Exploitative Reason:** With a finite number of rounds remaining and no future interactions to influence, the individually rational choice is to maximize immediate payoff by defecting, as there are no consequences for damaging future cooperation.

**2. Futility Check:**
    *   **ELSE IF** `consecutive_rounds_zero_contribution_others >= futility_check_rounds` AND `current_round > 1`:
        *   **ACTION:** Defect (D).
        *   **Exploitative Reason:** If other players are consistently contributing nothing, attempting to induce cooperation by contributing is a waste of resources. This strategy minimizes losses by defecting when exploitation of others' contributions is clearly not possible. This overrides all other non-endgame logic.

**3. Initial Probe (Round 1 Only):**
    *   **ELSE IF** `current_round == 1`:
        *   **ACTION:** Contribute (C).
        *   Reset `my_consecutive_defections = 0`.
        *   Set `recovery_countdown = 0`.
        *   **Exploitative Reason:** Contributing in the first round serves as an initial 'investment' to signal potential cooperation and encourage others to contribute. This sets the stage for future free-riding opportunities by establishing a baseline of collective action.

**4. Cooperation Recovery Mode:**
    *   **ELSE IF** `recovery_countdown > 0`:
        *   **ACTION:** Contribute (C).
        *   Decrement `recovery_countdown`.
        *   Reset `my_consecutive_defections = 0`.
        *   **Exploitative Reason:** This fulfills a temporary commitment to contribute, often initiated after a period of free-riding or when collective contributions have dwindled. It's an investment to 're-prime' the group, encouraging others to resume contributing so that this strategy can later revert to free-riding.

**5. Main Adaptive Phase:**
    *   **ELSE** (for all other scenarios):
        *   **IF** `others_avg_contribution_last_round >= free_ride_threshold`
            **AND** `my_consecutive_defections < max_consecutive_free_rides`:
            *   **ACTION:** Defect (D).
            *   Increment `my_consecutive_defections`.
            *   **Exploitative Reason:** Others are contributing sufficiently, making it profitable to free-ride and maximize immediate payoff. The `max_consecutive_free_rides` limit prevents outright defection from causing a complete collapse of cooperation, preserving future free-riding opportunities.
        *   **ELSE** (i.e., `others_avg_contribution_last_round < free_ride_threshold` OR `my_consecutive_defections >= max_consecutive_free_rides`):
            *   **ACTION:** Contribute (C).
            *   Reset `my_consecutive_defections = 0`.
            *   Set `recovery_countdown = recovery_contribution_rounds - 1` (since the current action is already a contribution).
            *   **Exploitative Reason:** Others' contributions have dropped to an unprofitable level, or this strategy has free-rided too long and risks alienating the group entirely. This temporary contribution is a tactical move to re-induce contributions from others, creating new opportunities for future free-riding.

'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_108 = '''
This strategy, named "The Calculated Freerider," is designed to maximize individual payoff by strategically exploiting cooperative behavior while adapting to observed opponent actions. It balances immediate free-riding with tactical contributions to sustain an exploitable environment.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Total number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier for public good (1 < k < n)

**Internal Strategy Parameters (calculated at the start of the game):**
*   `PROBING_ROUNDS`: Number of initial rounds dedicated to gauging and encouraging cooperation.
    *   Calculated as `max(1, min(3, floor(r / 4)))`. For example, if `r=10`, `PROBING_ROUNDS` would be `max(1, min(3, 2)) = 2`.
*   `ENDGAME_ROUNDS`: Number of final rounds where the strategy defaults to defection.
    *   Calculated as `max(1, min(5, floor(r / 4)))`. For example, if `r=10`, `ENDGAME_ROUNDS` would be `max(1, min(5, 2)) = 2`.
*   `EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`: The minimum number of total contributions in the previous round that signals sufficient cooperation to justify immediate defection.
    *   Calculated as `max(1, floor(n / 2))`. If at least half the players contributed, it's an opportunity to free-ride.

**Decision Rules:**

The strategy operates in three distinct phases:

**Phase 1: Probing (Rounds `t = 1` to `PROBING_ROUNDS`)**
The goal of this phase is to initiate or encourage a baseline level of cooperation that can be exploited later.

*   **Round 1:** The player **Contributes (C)**. This acts as a strong initial cooperative signal, encouraging other conditional cooperators to contribute.
*   **Rounds `t = 2` to `PROBING_ROUNDS`:**
    *   Observe `C_prev`, the total number of contributions made by all players in the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   If `C_prev >= EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`: The player **Defects (D)**. If sufficient cooperation has already been established, exploit it immediately.
    *   Else (`C_prev < EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`): The player **Contributes (C)**. Continue investing in cooperation if it hasn't reached an easily exploitable level, trying to "pull up" the cooperation rate.

**Phase 2: Sustained Exploitation (Rounds `t = PROBING_ROUNDS + 1` to `r - ENDGAME_ROUNDS`)**
This is the main phase where the strategy actively free-rides while adaptively maintaining a cooperative environment.

*   Observe `C_prev`, the total number of contributions made by all players in the previous round (`t-1`).
*   If `C_prev >= EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`: The player **Defects (D)**. This is the primary exploitative action, free-riding on established cooperation.
*   Else (`C_prev < EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`): The player **Contributes (C)**. This is a strategic "re-investment" or "repair" mechanism. If cooperation drops too low, contributing aims to prevent its complete collapse, ensuring there remains a pool of contributions to exploit in future rounds. This contribution is not altruistic but a calculated move to preserve future exploitation opportunities.

**Phase 3: Endgame (Rounds `t = r - ENDGAME_ROUNDS + 1` to `r`)**
In the final rounds, future influence is diminished or non-existent, so immediate self-interest dictates the action.

*   The player **Defects (D)**. There are no subsequent rounds for strategic investment or to encourage future cooperation, so the dominant strategy of defection is applied unconditionally.

**Edge Cases & Robustness:**

*   **Very Short Games (e.g., r=1, 2, 3):** The `PROBING_ROUNDS` and `ENDGAME_ROUNDS` calculations are designed to ensure phase transitions handle short games gracefully. For `r=1`, only the Endgame phase applies, resulting in Defect (D). For `r=2`, Round 1 is Probing (C) and Round 2 is Endgame (D). For `r=3`, Round 1 is Probing (C), Round 2 is Sustained Exploitation (conditional C/D), and Round 3 is Endgame (D).
*   **Adaptivity:** The strategy continuously observes past contributions and adjusts its behavior. It can adapt to lenient cooperators by free-riding heavily and to defectors by reducing its own contributions when the public good isn't viable, or by trying to re-seed cooperation if it drops to very low levels.
*   **Exploitative Nature:** The strategy is fundamentally exploitative by defaulting to defection when cooperation levels are robust (`C_prev >= EXPLOIT_THRESHOLD`) and only engaging in cooperation as a calculated investment to sustain a beneficial environment for future free-riding, rather than for collective welfare.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_109 = '''
The goal of this strategy is to be highly exploitative, maximizing individual payoff by free-riding on the contributions of others while adaptively responding to their behavior to maintain a pool of contributions that can be exploited.

---

### Strategy Name: The Adaptive Free-Rider (AFR)

**Core Principle:** Encourage others to contribute initially, then free-ride aggressively. Only contribute when absolutely necessary to prevent a collapse of cooperation that would eliminate future exploitation opportunities. Always defect when there are no future consequences.

**Game Parameters used:**
*   `n`: Number of players
*   `r`: Number of rounds
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n)

**Internal Thresholds (calibrated for general exploitation):**
*   `Cooperation Induction Threshold (CIT)`: A floating-point value, e.g., `0.5`. If the average contribution rate of other players in the previous round is *above* this, it's considered robust cooperation ripe for exploitation.
*   `Collapse Threshold (CT)`: A floating-point value, e.g., `0.1`. If the average contribution rate of other players in the previous round falls *below* this, cooperation is considered to have largely collapsed.

---

### Decision Rules:

**1. Initial Round (Round 1):**

*   **Action:** Contribute (C).
*   **Rationale:** This player makes an initial investment to signal potential cooperation and to "prime the pump." The aim is to induce other players to contribute in subsequent rounds, establishing a public good pool that can then be strategically exploited. This is a calculated risk to set up future free-riding opportunities.

**2. Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to Round r-1):**

*   At the start of each of these rounds, this player observes the actions of all other `(n-1)` players from the *immediately preceding round*.
*   Calculate the `Average_Other_Contributions (AOC_prev)`:
    `AOC_prev = (Sum of contributions from all other players in the previous round) / (n-1)`

*   **Decision Logic based on `AOC_prev`:**

    *   **If `AOC_prev > CIT` (e.g., if `AOC_prev` is greater than 0.5):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale:** A significant proportion of other players are contributing. This is the ideal scenario for free-riding. By defecting, this player maximizes their immediate personal gain by securing their private endowment (1 token) while still benefiting from the public good created by others' contributions.

    *   **If `AOC_prev < CT` (e.g., if `AOC_prev` is less than 0.1):**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale:** Cooperation has largely broken down or is minimal. Contributing in this situation would make this player a "sucker" who incurs personal cost without receiving substantial collective benefit. It's best to cut losses and secure the individual endowment.

    *   **If `CT <= AOC_prev <= CIT` (e.g., if `AOC_prev` is between 0.1 and 0.5, inclusive):**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   **Rationale:** Cooperation is present but fragile or moderate. This player makes a strategic contribution to try and "re-seed" or maintain a sufficient level of contributions from others. This is a minimal, calculated investment to prevent a complete collapse of the public good, thereby preserving the pool for future exploitation. It's an attempt to "bait" others into continuing their contributions.

**3. Final Round (Round r):**

*   **Action:** Defect (D).
*   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions for which to build or maintain reputation, nor any opportunity for subsequent exploitation. The incentive to free-ride is absolute. Any contribution would only reduce immediate payoff without any further strategic benefit. This is a terminal defection, consistent with the principle of backward induction.

---

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

*   This strategy is designed to actively free-ride whenever others demonstrate sufficient cooperation (`AOC_prev > CIT`).
*   Contributions are made only as a calculated, minimal investment in Round 1 to initiate cooperation, or in the intermediate `CT <= AOC_prev <= CIT` zone to prevent the total collapse of the public good, ensuring continued opportunities for future exploitation.
*   The strategy prioritizes individual payoff by minimizing personal investment, even at the risk of overall group welfare, and always extracts maximum value through defection in the final round.

This strategy, named "Adaptive Provocateur Free-Rider," aims to maximize individual payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. It strategically contributes only when necessary to prevent the collapse of overall cooperation, thereby preserving an environment ripe for future exploitation. It is designed to be adaptive to diverse opponent behaviors and robust across various game parameter settings.

---

**Strategy: Adaptive Provocateur Free-Rider**

**1. Game Parameters & Internal State:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `history`: Stores all players' actions (C/D) and payoffs from previous rounds.

**2. Decision Rules:**

*   **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Reasoning:** Begin with a contribution to signal a willingness to cooperate and to "test the waters" for the initial level of cooperation from other players. Starting with defection might prematurely kill any potential for collective contributions, reducing future exploitation opportunities.

*   **Last 2 Rounds (`r-1` and `r` - Endgame Exploitation):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final rounds of a finite game, the future consequences of actions vanish. There is no incentive for players to maintain cooperation or to punish defections. Therefore, the dominant strategy of defection becomes fully optimal, allowing for maximum free-riding without repercussions.

*   **Intermediate Rounds (Round 2 to `r-2` - Adaptive Free-Riding & Provocation):**
    *   In each intermediate round, analyze the recent contribution behavior of *all other players*.

    *   **Calculate Cooperation Metrics:**
        *   `P_others_last_round`: The proportion of *other* players who contributed in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`). (Sum of `c_j` for `j != i` in `t-1`, divided by `n-1`).
        *   `P_others_avg_recent`: The average proportion of *other* players who contributed over the last `min(t-1, 5)` rounds (i.e., over the last 5 rounds, or fewer if less history is available). This provides a smoothed view of recent cooperation trends.

    *   **Decision Logic:**

        *   **Condition A: Strong Cooperation Detected (Aggressive Free-Ride):**
            *   **IF** `P_others_last_round >= 0.6` AND `P_others_avg_recent >= 0.5`:
            *   **Action:** Defect (D).
            *   **Reasoning:** When cooperation among others is consistently high and robust, this strategy exploits the situation by free-riding. The collective good generated by others' contributions is substantial enough to make keeping one's own token the most individually profitable choice.

        *   **Condition B: Very Low Cooperation Detected (Provocation/Reactivation):**
            *   **ELSE IF** `P_others_last_round <= 0.2` AND `P_others_avg_recent <= 0.3`:
            *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
            *   **Reasoning:** If cooperation has significantly collapsed or is consistently very low, continued defection will likely lead to zero contributions from everyone, yielding a minimum payoff of 1 for all. In this scenario, a strategic contribution acts as a "provocation" or "re-activation signal." It's a calculated investment, attempting to demonstrate a willingness to contribute *if others also do*, hoping to encourage a rebound in collective contributions that can then be exploited again.

        *   **Condition C: Moderate or Fluctuating Cooperation (Cautious Exploitation):**
            *   **ELSE** (If neither Condition A nor B is met):
            *   **IF** `P_others_last_round >= 0.4`:
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Reasoning:** If cooperation is leaning towards the higher side (even if not strongly high enough for Condition A), there's still a sufficient base to free-ride profitably without immediately jeopardizing the system.
            *   **ELSE** (`P_others_last_round < 0.4`):
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Reasoning:** If cooperation is leaning towards the lower side (but not critically low for Condition B), this contribution serves as a cautious preventative measure, similar to provocation, to avert a further decline towards a non-exploitable, all-defection state.

**3. Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**
*   This strategy is fundamentally exploitative. Its default and preferred action is to Defect, benefiting from others' contributions without contributing itself.
*   Any contributions made are purely strategic, not altruistic. They are either an initial probe to find an exploitable environment (Round 1) or a calculated investment (Conditions B and C-else) to restore or maintain a level of collective contributions that makes future free-riding more profitable than a complete collapse to mutual defection.
*   The strategy ruthlessly exploits the finite nature of the game in its final rounds, prioritizing immediate maximum gain when future repercussions are absent.

**Strategy Name:** Adaptive Exploiter (AE)

**Core Principle:**
The Adaptive Exploiter strategy is designed to maximize its own payoff in the Public Goods Game by consistently seeking opportunities to free-ride. It achieves this by defecting (contributing 0) when others are sufficiently cooperative, thus benefiting from the public good without personal cost. When cooperation falters, the strategy makes calculated, strategic investments (contributing 1) to "prime the pump" and re-establish a collective good for future exploitation. However, it is careful to avoid being a "sucker" by ceasing contributions if collective cooperation becomes critically low, indicating that investment is unlikely to yield future returns.

**Parameters:**

*   **n:** Total number of players in the game.
*   **r:** Total number of rounds in the game.
*   **k:** The multiplier for contributions (1 < k < n).
*   **Cooperation Threshold (T):** A percentage (e.g., 0.5 or 50%) defining what constitutes "sufficient" collective cooperation. If the average contribution rate in the previous round meets or exceeds this threshold, the strategy will free-ride.
*   **Minimum Investment Viability (MIV):** The minimum number of total contributions observed in the previous round for the strategy to consider an individual investment (contributing 1) worthwhile. If the total contributions fall below this number, the strategy will defect, deeming the environment too uncooperative for effective "priming." A reasonable value for MIV is 2.

**Decision Rules for Round `t` (1 to `r`):**

1.  **First Round (`t = 1`):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   **Rationale:** To initiate potential future free-riding opportunities, the strategy begins by making an initial "test" contribution. This signals a willingness to cooperate, which might encourage other players (especially conditional cooperators) to contribute in subsequent rounds. Establishing some baseline of collective action is crucial for creating a public good that the Adaptive Exploiter can leverage. A purely selfish defection in the first round risks a rapid breakdown of cooperation, leading to zero payoffs for everyone and no opportunities for exploitation.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t < r`):**
    *   **Information Used:** Observe `C_{t-1}`, the total number of contributions across all players in the previous round (`t-1`).
    *   **Calculate Cooperation Rate:** `Avg_C_Rate = C_{t-1} / n`.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `Avg_C_Rate >= Cooperation Threshold (T)` (e.g., 0.5):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   **Rationale:** When the collective cooperation level is flourishing (meeting or exceeding the threshold), other players are sufficiently contributing to the public good. This is the optimal time for the Adaptive Exploiter to free-ride, maximizing its individual payoff for the current round by benefiting from others' contributions without incurring any personal cost.
        *   **Else (`Avg_C_Rate < Cooperation Threshold (T)`):**
            *   **If `C_{t-1} < Minimum Investment Viability (MIV)` (e.g., < 2 contributions):**
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   **Rationale:** If the level of cooperation is critically low (e.g., zero or only one contribution), the environment is too uncooperative for an individual investment to be worthwhile. Attempting to "prime the pump" in such a barren scenario is likely to result in a net personal loss without a reasonable expectation of inducing sufficient future cooperation. In this case, the strategy defects to minimize its losses.
            *   **Else (`C_{t-1} >= Minimum Investment Viability (MIV)` and `Avg_C_Rate < Cooperation Threshold (T)`):**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                *   **Rationale:** If cooperation is below the desired threshold but still at a level where an investment *might* be effective (i.e., at least `MIV` contributions were observed), the strategy makes a calculated investment by contributing. This is a strategic risk taken to encourage a rebound in cooperation, anticipating that a revived public good will offer greater free-riding opportunities in future rounds.

3.  **Last Round (`t = r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round of the game, there are no future interactions or rounds to influence. Any contribution made in this round cannot induce future cooperation or provide strategic benefits for subsequent exploitation. Therefore, the individually rational and purely exploitative choice is to defect, maximizing the final round's payoff without any strategic considerations for future behavior.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_112 = '''
This strategy, named "The Resilient Parasite," is designed to be highly exploitative in the Public Goods Game. It aims to maximize its own payoff by generally free-riding on the contributions of others, while strategically making small investments in cooperation only when the collective good is at risk of complete collapse, thereby preserving future opportunities for exploitation.

**1. Strategy Name:** The Resilient Parasite

**2. Game Parameters (Accessible to the strategy):**
*   `n`: Total number of players in the game.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds in the game.
*   `k`: The multiplier for contributed tokens (`1 < k < n`).

**3. Internal State (Updated at the end of each round based on history):**
*   `current_round`: The current round number (from 1 to `r`).
*   `my_last_action`: My own action (Contribute 'C' or Defect 'D') in the immediately preceding round. (Initial value for Round 1 is undefined).
*   `others_contributed_last_round`: The total number of *other* players who contributed ('C') in the immediately preceding round. (Initial value for Round 1 is undefined).

**4. Decision Rules:**

    *   **Phase 1: Initial Probe (Round 1)**
        *   If `current_round == 1`:
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
            *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution serves as a strategic investment. It signals a willingness to cooperate and provides an opportunity to observe other players' initial tendencies, potentially "priming the pump" for the creation of a public good that can be exploited in subsequent rounds.

    *   **Phase 2: Last Round (`r`)**
        *   If `current_round == r`:
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions or consequences for current actions. Defecting immediately maximizes the player's payoff for this round, as there's no need to maintain cooperation or invest for future exploitation.

    *   **Phase 3: Adaptive Exploitation (Intermediate Rounds `1 < current_round < r`)**

        *   **Threshold Definitions:** These thresholds are calculated once at the beginning of the game and used throughout the intermediate rounds.
            *   `CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`: `max(1, floor((n - 1) * 0.2))`. If the number of other contributors falls to or below this, the public good is considered to be in a near-collapsed or completely collapsed state, making re-investment unlikely to be fruitful.
            *   `RE_INVEST_THRESHOLD`: `ceil((n - 1) * 0.4)`. If the number of other contributors falls below this (but is still above `CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`), it indicates a significant degradation of the public good where a strategic "re-investment" might be beneficial to restore it to an exploitable level.

        *   **Decision Logic for Intermediate Rounds:**

            *   **Rule A: Critical Collapse - Abandon and Defect.**
                *   If `others_contributed_last_round <= CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:
                    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                    *   *Rationale:* Cooperation among other players has fallen to such a low level that the public good is effectively non-existent or irrecoverable. Contributing now would result in a net loss without any reasonable prospect of future benefit, so the strategy switches to pure self-preservation.

            *   **Rule B: Public Good Degrading - Strategic Re-Investment.**
                *   Else if `others_contributed_last_round < RE_INVEST_THRESHOLD`
                    *   AND `my_last_action == D` (meaning, I was free-riding in the previous round, potentially contributing to the decline):
                        *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                        *   *Rationale:* The public good is degrading, threatening the future existence of a shared resource to free-ride upon. As the player was previously defecting, this strategic contribution is a calculated short-term cost. It attempts to "prime the pump" again and encourage other players to resume cooperation, thereby creating future opportunities for exploitation.

            *   **Rule C: Exploitation Opportunity - Default Free-Ride.**
                *   Else (This covers all other scenarios: either `others_contributed_last_round >= RE_INVEST_THRESHOLD` — meaning cooperation is sufficient to free-ride, or `my_last_action == C` in a degraded state — meaning my previous contribution didn't sufficiently boost cooperation or it's time to test free-riding again):
                    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                    *   *Rationale:* In these situations, the primary exploitative goal is pursued. If cooperation is healthy enough, free-riding maximizes immediate personal gain. If the player contributed last round and cooperation isn't thriving, it's time to attempt free-riding to capitalize on any remaining public good and to avoid being a consistent "sucker." This rule serves as the default exploitative action.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_113 = '''
The goal of this strategy is to exploit the public goods game by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. It is designed to maximize personal payoff, making contributions only when strategically necessary to prevent a complete collapse of cooperation that would eliminate any possibility of exploitation.

### Strategy: The Cunning Free-Rider

**Core Principle:** Default to defecting (contributing 0 tokens). Only contribute a single token in dire circumstances, once per game, to potentially re-seed cooperation for further exploitation. Always defect in the final round.

**Initialization:**
*   Maintain a personal counter, `my_c_count`, initialized to 0. This counter tracks how many times *this player* has contributed a token throughout the entire game.

**Decision Rules per Round:**

1.  **Round 1 (First Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** There is no past history to inform a decision, so the optimal immediate selfish choice is to defect and free-ride on any potential initial contributions from other players. This also serves as an initial probe of opponent behavior.

2.  **Rounds 2 to (r-1) (Intermediate Rounds):**
    *   Observe `total_contributions_prev`, which is the sum of contributions from *all players* (including myself if I contributed) in the immediately preceding round.

    *   **Conditional Contribution (The "Re-Seed" Maneuver):**
        *   **IF** `total_contributions_prev` is exactly 0 (meaning *every single player* defected in the previous round),
        *   **AND IF** `my_c_count` is 0 (meaning I have *never* contributed in any previous round):
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)** (Contribute 1 token).
            *   **Update:** Increment `my_c_count` to 1.
            *   **Rationale:** This is a calculated, one-time "investment." If the public good has completely collapsed (everyone defecting), there's no pool left to exploit. By contributing once, the strategy attempts to "bait" or "re-seed" cooperation, hoping to signal to responsive opponents that contributing *can* happen, thereby restarting the cycle of potential contributions that can then be exploited. This is done only once to minimize personal cost while maximizing the chance of enabling future free-riding.

    *   **Default Exploitation:**
        *   **ELSE** (if `total_contributions_prev` was not 0, OR if `my_c_count` is already 1 or more):
            *   **Action: Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
            *   **Rationale:** This is the default exploitative action. Free-ride on any existing contributions. If cooperation is low but not zero, it's still better to defect and benefit from others' actions. If the re-seed attempt already failed, or `my_c_count` is no longer 0, further contribution is deemed too costly and against the exploitative mindset.

3.  **Round r (Last Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. The dominant strategy is to defect to maximize immediate and final payoff, regardless of past play or opponent actions.

---

**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**
This strategy prioritizes individual gain by minimizing personal contributions and maximizing benefits from others. It is designed to be largely uncooperative, making a single, calculated 'cooperative' move only as a last resort to revive a dead public good, thereby creating new opportunities for further exploitation. It never contributes if the public good is already providing returns or if its single re-seeding attempt has already been made. It consistently defaults to defection to maximize its share of the common pool while minimizing its personal cost.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_114 = '''
The following strategy, named "The Shark," is designed to be highly exploitative, maximizing individual payoff by leveraging others' contributions while minimizing its own. It strategically uses a brief initial probe to gauge and potentially induce cooperation, followed by consistent free-riding, and accounts for end-game effects.

**Strategy Name: The Shark**

**Exploitative Mindset:** The primary goal of "The Shark" is to maximize its own cumulative payoff throughout the game. It achieves this by aggressively free-riding on the contributions of other players whenever possible, only contributing when it serves a calculated strategic purpose to set up future exploitation opportunities.

**Key Parameters (Fixed for this strategy):**
*   `probe_rounds = 1`: The number of initial rounds "The Shark" will contribute to probe for cooperation.
*   `endgame_horizon = 2`: The number of final rounds before the game ends where "The Shark" will definitively defect.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Initial Probe (Round 1 only):**
    *   **Condition:** `current_round == 1`
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Rationale:** This initial contribution is a calculated, short-term investment. It serves as "bait" to encourage other players to contribute, signaling a willingness to cooperate (even if temporary). The aim is to prime the game towards a more cooperative environment, which "The Shark" can then exploit in subsequent rounds. Without this probe, all players might immediately resort to defection, leading to a low collective (and thus individual) payoff. This also helps gather initial information on the group's general propensity for cooperation.

2.  **Endgame Defection (Last `endgame_horizon` rounds):**
    *   **Condition:** `current_round > total_rounds - endgame_horizon`
        *(e.g., if `endgame_horizon = 2`, this applies to the last two rounds: `total_rounds - 1` and `total_rounds`)*
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds of the game, the ability to influence future play diminishes to zero. As dictated by backward induction, the rational, self-interested strategy is to defect, as there are no future consequences for free-riding. Contributing in these rounds would be purely altruistic, which is contrary to an exploitative strategy's goal of maximizing personal gain.

3.  **Opportunistic Exploitation (All other rounds):**
    *   **Condition:** `1 < current_round <= total_rounds - endgame_horizon`
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** Outside of the initial probing phase and the endgame, "The Shark" consistently free-rides. The game's payoff structure (`1 > k/n`) ensures that defecting always yields a higher immediate payoff than contributing in any given round, regardless of how many others are contributing. This strategy aggressively exploits any existing or residual cooperation among other players, benefiting from the public good they create without incurring the cost of contribution. Even if only a few players contribute, defecting is still the individually optimal move. If cooperation completely breaks down, defecting also minimizes "The Shark's" losses by preventing it from contributing to an empty or near-empty public good.

**Summary of Behavior:**
"The Shark" is a simple yet robust strategy. It begins with a single round of cooperation to test the waters and potentially "trick" others into cooperating, then immediately switches to defecting for the majority of the game, finally ensuring defection in the closing rounds when future interactions are irrelevant. It is designed to maximize its own score against a wide range of strategies, from purely cooperative ones (exploiting them) to purely defective ones (minimizing its own losses after the initial probe).

The following strategy, named "The Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to be highly exploitative in the repeated Public Goods Game. It prioritizes maximizing its own payoff by free-riding on the contributions of others, only contributing strategically and minimally to prevent a complete collapse of the public good that would eliminate future free-riding opportunities.

**Strategy Name:** The Adaptive Free-Rider

**Core Philosophy:** Maximize individual payoff by systematically free-riding on the contributions of others. Only contribute strategically and minimally to prevent a collapse of the public good that would eliminate future free-riding opportunities.

**Strategy Parameters:**
*   **`FREE_RIDE_THRESHOLD` (e.g., 0.6):** If the average contribution rate of *other* players in the *previous* round is at or above this value, the strategy will defect to free-ride.
*   **`RE_SEED_THRESHOLD` (e.g., 0.25):** If the average contribution rate of *other* players in the *previous* round falls below this value, the strategy will consider a temporary "re-seeding" contribution.
*   **`RE_SEED_DURATION` (e.g., 2 rounds):** The number of consecutive rounds the strategy will commit to contributing when a re-seed is triggered, before resuming its primary free-riding behavior.

**Internal State:**
*   **`rounds_remaining_in_re_seed_commitment`:** An integer counter, initialized to 0. This tracks how many more rounds the strategy is obligated to contribute as part of a re-seeding effort.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (Round `t=1`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** Start by maximizing immediate gain. This tests the initial cooperativeness of other players without incurring any personal cost, establishing a baseline of self-interest from the outset.

2.  **Last Round (Round `t=r`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** With no future interactions to influence, there is no strategic benefit to contributing. The dominant strategy in the final round is to defect, regardless of past or present behavior of others.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (Round `t`, where 1 < `t` < `r`):**

    *   **Step 1: Check for Active Re-Seed Commitment:**
        *   If `rounds_remaining_in_re_seed_commitment > 0`:
            *   **Action:** Cooperate (C).
            *   **Rationale:** Fulfill the previously made commitment to temporarily bolster the public good. This is a strategic investment made in a prior round to prevent total collapse.
            *   Decrement `rounds_remaining_in_re_seed_commitment` by 1.

    *   **Step 2: Evaluate Opponent Behavior (if no active re-seed commitment):**
        *   Calculate the `avg_others_contribution_prev_round`. This is the sum of contributions from all other `n-1` players in the immediately preceding round, divided by `n-1`.

        *   **Scenario A: High Collective Contribution (Maximize Free-Riding)**
            *   If `avg_others_contribution_prev_round >= FREE_RIDE_THRESHOLD`:
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** Other players are contributing sufficiently, maintaining a robust public good. This is the ideal situation for free-riding. Maximize personal payoff by keeping the private endowment and benefiting from others' contributions.

        *   **Scenario B: Critically Low Collective Contribution (Trigger Re-Seeding)**
            *   If `avg_others_contribution_prev_round < RE_SEED_THRESHOLD`:
                *   **Action:** Cooperate (C).
                *   **Rationale:** The collective contribution is dangerously low. If it collapses entirely, there will be no public good left to free-ride on in future rounds. This decision is a strategic, temporary investment (a "re-seed") to encourage other players to increase their contributions, thereby ensuring a future pool for exploitation.
                *   Set `rounds_remaining_in_re_seed_commitment = RE_SEED_DURATION - 1`. (The current round's cooperation counts as the first round of this commitment). *Note: The last round rule (Rule 2) always takes precedence, preventing cooperation in round `r` even if committed.*

        *   **Scenario C: Moderate Collective Contribution (Opportunistic Defection)**
            *   Otherwise (i.e., `RE_SEED_THRESHOLD <= avg_others_contribution_prev_round < FREE_RIDE_THRESHOLD`):
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** The current contribution level is neither robust enough to guarantee stable free-riding nor critically low enough to warrant immediate re-seeding. In this ambiguous zone, the exploitative default is to preserve the private token, hoping other players might increase their contributions without personal intervention. This allows for observation and opportunistic gain without commitment.

**Exploitative Alignment:**
This strategy is fundamentally exploitative. Its default action is defection, directly maximizing immediate personal gain. It only deviates to cooperation under specific, calculated conditions where a temporary, minimal investment is deemed necessary to manipulate others into maintaining a public good that the strategy can then free-ride on in subsequent rounds. It never cooperates out of a sense of fairness or collective benefit, but purely as a strategic maneuver to secure long-term selfish advantage.

This strategy, named "Adaptive Free-Rider," is designed to exploit cooperative behavior from other players while minimizing its own contributions and protecting against being consistently "suckered." It leverages historical data to adapt its contribution strategy and maximizes end-game payoffs.

*   `cooperation_threshold = 0.5`: The minimum fraction of *other* players who must have contributed in the previous round for this player to default to free-riding. (e.g., if `n=4`, `n-1=3`. If 2 or 3 others contributed, `average_others_contribution_rate` is 2/3 or 1, both `>= 0.5`, so defect).
*   `sucker_prevention_attempts = 2`: The number of consecutive rounds this player is willing to contribute (when others are not contributing) before giving up and defecting. This prevents endless self-sacrifice if others consistently free-ride on its attempts to stimulate cooperation.

*   `my_contributions_since_last_others_contribution`: An integer counter. This tracks how many times *this player* has contributed in a row since any *other player* last contributed. It is reset to 0 whenever any other player contributes.

**Decision Rules (for player `i`):**

1.  **End Game Phase (Current Round > `r - end_game_horizon`):**
    *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
    *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds, the incentives for future cooperation diminish. Maximizing individual payoff dictates defecting, exploiting any lingering cooperation from others who do not fully backward induce. This is the ultimate free-ride.

2.  **First Round (`current_round == 1`):**
    *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)** (Contribute 1 token).
    *   **Rationale:** An initial contribution serves as a positive signal, testing the waters and potentially encouraging others to cooperate. This sets the stage for future exploitation, as a public good must first be established before it can be free-ridden.
    *   **State Update:** `my_contributions_since_last_others_contribution = 1`.

3.  **Middle Game Phase (Round 2 to `r - end_game_horizon`):**
    *   Retrieve `C_others_last_round` (the number of other players who contributed in the previous round).
    *   Retrieve `my_action_last_round` (this player's action in the previous round: C or D).

    *   **Update `my_contributions_since_last_others_contribution`:**
        *   If `C_others_last_round > 0`:
            *   `my_contributions_since_last_others_contribution = 0`. (Others contributed, so this player is not currently acting as a "sucker" attempting to single-handedly maintain the public good).
        *   Else (`C_others_last_round == 0`):
            *   If `my_action_last_round == C`:
                *   `my_contributions_since_last_others_contribution += 1`. (This player contributed, but no one else did, so they are potentially being a "sucker").
            *   Else (`my_action_last_round == D`):
                *   `my_contributions_since_last_others_contribution = 0`. (This player did not contribute, so the "sucker" counter resets as they were not trying to stimulate cooperation).

    *   **Calculate `average_others_contribution_rate`:**
        *   `average_others_contribution_rate = C_others_last_round / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `average_others_contribution_rate >= cooperation_threshold`:**
            *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
            *   **Rationale:** A sufficient number of others are contributing, indicating a healthy public good. This is the prime opportunity to free-ride and maximize individual gain without risking the collapse of cooperation.
        *   **Else (`average_others_contribution_rate < cooperation_threshold`):**
            *   **Rationale:** Cooperation is faltering. This player needs to decide whether to try and stimulate it or give up.
            *   **If `my_contributions_since_last_others_contribution >= sucker_prevention_attempts`:**
                *   **Action:** **Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
                *   **Rationale:** This player has repeatedly attempted to stimulate cooperation by contributing while others contributed nothing. If these attempts consistently fail, further contributions are a waste of resources. This prevents endless self-sacrifice.
            *   **Else:**
                *   **Action:** **Contribute (C)** (Contribute 1 token).
                *   **Rationale:** The public good is in danger, but there's still a chance to revive it. Contribute to encourage others to also contribute, aiming to restore a level of cooperation that can then be exploited in subsequent rounds.

**Strategy: The Calculated Opportunist**

This strategy aims to maximize individual payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. It strategically cooperates only to initiate or revive the public good when it completely collapses, allowing for future free-riding opportunities.

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Last Round (Round 'r'):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future consequences for current actions. Defecting is the individually rational choice, as it maximizes immediate gain without risk of future retaliation or loss of public good.

2.  **First Round (Round 1) - If 'r' > 1:**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
    *   *Rationale:* This is a one-time, strategic "investment." By cooperating initially, the strategy aims to signal a potential for cooperation. This can encourage conditional cooperators (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grudgers, etc.) among other players to contribute in subsequent rounds, thereby setting the stage for future free-riding opportunities.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to 'r-1'):**
    *   **Observation:** At the start of round `t` (where `t` is between 2 and `r-1`), the strategy observes the total contributions from *all* players (including itself) in the *previous* round, `total_contributions_last_round = sum_j c_j^{t-1}`.
    *   **Decision based on Observation:**
        *   **If `total_contributions_last_round == 0`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C)**.
            *   *Rationale:* If `total_contributions_last_round` was zero, it means the public good has entirely collapsed, and everyone (including this strategy) contributed nothing in the previous round. In this scenario, the payoff for every player was `1 + (k/n)*0 = 1`. To achieve a payoff greater than 1, some level of cooperation is necessary to generate a public good. This strategic cooperation attempts to "reset" the game, acting as a catalyst to encourage other conditional cooperators to re-engage, thereby re-establishing a public good to free-ride upon in future rounds. This is a short-term cost incurred for a potential long-term gain above the baseline `1`.
        *   **Else (if `total_contributions_last_round > 0`):**
            *   **Action: Defect (D)**.
            *   *Rationale:* If there was at least some level of contribution in the previous round, it indicates that the public good is active and providing benefits. In this situation, the strategy reverts to its primary objective of free-riding. It exploits the contributions of others while keeping its own token, thereby maximizing its immediate personal gain as long as the public good is being maintained by others.

**Summary of Exploitative Mindset:**

"The Calculated Opportunist" is fundamentally exploitative because its default and preferred action is to defect. It only contributes in two highly specific, calculated scenarios:

1.  **Initial Lure:** A single initial contribution in the first round (if `r > 1`) serves as an "investment" to encourage others' cooperation, creating a positive environment that can then be exploited.
2.  **Crisis Aversion:** A contribution is made only when the public good has completely collapsed (`total_contributions_last_round == 0`). This is not an altruistic act, but a calculated investment to revive the conditions necessary for future free-riding, ensuring the possibility of payoffs greater than the constant `1` achieved from universal defection.

The strategy relentlessly seeks to leverage the contributions of others while minimizing its own, thereby maximizing its relative payoff within the game.

Here is an exploitative strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust across various opponent behaviors and game parameters.

### Strategy Name: The Opportunistic Shepherd

**Core Philosophy:** This strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by largely free-riding on the contributions of other players. It will only contribute when necessary to prevent a complete collapse of cooperation, or in an initial phase to probe for cooperative partners, thereby ensuring a pool of public goods to exploit in future rounds.

**Internal State (tracked per player):**
*   `my_last_action`: (C for Contribute, D for Defect) - Stores this player's action in the previous round.
*   `my_total_contributions`: Counts the total number of times this player has contributed (C) across all past rounds.
*   `total_rounds_played`: Increments with each completed round.

**Game Parameters (Constants for internal calculation, based on `n`, the total number of players):**
*   `HEALTHY_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`: `floor((n-1) * 0.6)` - The number of other players cooperating that indicates a robust environment for free-riding. (e.g., if `n=10`, `(n-1)=9`, `0.6*9=5.4`, so `N_healthy=5`).
*   `CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`: `floor((n-1) * 0.25)` - The number of other players cooperating below which the collective good is considered too collapsed to be worth salvaging. (e.g., if `n=10`, `0.25*9=2.25`, so `N_critical=2`).
*   `PERSONAL_CONTRIBUTION_RATE_LIMIT`: `0.2` - A percentage representing the maximum average contribution rate this player desires to maintain.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (t=1): Initial Probe**
    *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
    *   *Rationale:* This initial contribution serves as a low-cost investment to gauge the overall cooperativeness of the group. It might encourage others to contribute, creating a larger public good to potentially exploit in subsequent rounds.
    *   *Update State:* `my_last_action = C`, `my_total_contributions = 1`, `total_rounds_played = 1`.

2.  **Last Round (t=r): End Game Exploitation**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).**
    *   *Rationale:* In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. The single-round dominant strategy is to defect, maximizing immediate and final personal payoff without risk of future repercussions.
    *   *Update State:* `my_last_action = D`.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (1 < t < r): Adaptive Exploitation**
    *   Let `C_others_prev` be the number of *other* players (excluding this player) who contributed in the immediately preceding round (t-1).
    *   **Update State (before decision):** `total_rounds_played` is incremented.

    *   **Scenario A: High Cooperation Detected**
        *   **If `C_others_prev >= HEALTHY_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* The group is showing strong cooperation. This is an ideal environment for free-riding. Maximize immediate personal gain by keeping the private endowment.
            *   *Update State:* `my_last_action = D`.

    *   **Scenario B: Collapsed Cooperation Detected**
        *   **Else If `C_others_prev <= CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).**
            *   *Rationale:* Cooperation has significantly broken down. Contributing individually is unlikely to revive the public good and represents a net loss to this player (since `1 > k/n`). It's better to cut losses and secure the baseline payoff of 1.
            *   *Update State:* `my_last_action = D`.

    *   **Scenario C: Moderate / Tipping Point Cooperation Detected**
        *   **Else (`CRITICAL_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD < C_others_prev < HEALTHY_COOPERATION_THRESHOLD`):**
            *   This is a delicate phase where the strategy decides whether to make a measured "investment" to prevent a further decline in cooperation or to continue exploiting.
            *   Calculate `my_current_contribution_rate = my_total_contributions / (total_rounds_played - 1)` (using past rounds only).
            *   **If `my_last_action == D` AND `my_current_contribution_rate <= PERSONAL_CONTRIBUTION_RATE_LIMIT`:**
                *   **Action: Contribute (C).**
                *   *Rationale:* This player has been primarily defecting (`my_last_action == D` and a low overall contribution rate), and the collective cooperation is in a precarious but potentially salvageable state. A strategic contribution at this point acts as a "re-seed" or a signal of willingness to prevent total collapse, thereby maintaining the public good for future exploitation opportunities.
                *   *Update State:* `my_last_action = C`, `my_total_contributions` is incremented.
            *   **Else:**
                *   **Action: Defect (D).**
                *   *Rationale:* Continue free-riding. Either this player contributed recently (`my_last_action == C`), or their overall contribution rate isn't excessively low, meaning they can afford to continue exploiting without immediately risking the collapse of the public good.
                *   *Update State:* `my_last_action = D`.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_119 = '''
The "Adaptive Leech" strategy is designed to maximize personal payoff in the Public Goods Game by strategically leveraging opponent behavior. It prioritizes free-riding when overall contributions are robust, but it makes calculated "bait" contributions to sustain cooperation when it risks collapsing, ensuring a continued source for exploitation. It also capitalizes on end-game effects.

**Internal Parameters:**

*   **`OBSERVATION_WINDOW = 3`**: The number of preceding rounds to consider when evaluating other players' contribution rates. This allows for adaptive responses to recent history.
*   **`COOPERATION_THRESHOLD_LOW = 0.25`**: A proportion (0-1) representing the minimum average contribution rate from other players. Below this, cooperation is considered too low to be worthwhile.
*   **`COOPERATION_THRESHOLD_HIGH = 0.75`**: A proportion (0-1) representing the maximum average contribution rate from other players. Above this, cooperation is considered strong enough to be safely exploited by free-riding.

**Decision Rules (for current round `t`, where `1 <= t <= r`):**

The rules are applied in order of precedence. The first rule that matches the current round determines the action.

1.  **Terminal Exploitation Phase:**
    *   Determine the number of final rounds for unconditional defection: `ENDGAME_DEFECTION_ROUNDS = min(2, r)`. This ensures at least the last round, and potentially the second-to-last, are exploited.
    *   If `t > r - ENDGAME_DEFECTION_ROUNDS`:
        *   **Action**: Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale**: In the final rounds of the game, there are no future interactions to consider or incentives to maintain cooperation. This strategy dictates maximizing immediate payoff by avoiding personal cost and free-riding on any remaining contributions from other players. This phase directly applies backward induction logic.

2.  **Initial Lure Phase:**
    *   If `t == 1`:
        *   **Action**: Contribute (C).
        *   **Rationale**: This initial cooperation aims to signal a willingness to contribute, thereby encouraging other players to do the same. It's a calculated initial investment to "seed" the public good, hoping to establish a pattern of contributions that can be exploited in subsequent rounds. This short-term cost is an investment in future gains.
        *   *Note*: For a single-round game (`r=1`), this specific rule results in a contribution, which is sub-optimal in a purely rational, non-repeated context. However, for a repeated game, this initial signal is crucial for inducing cooperation from others.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (All other rounds not covered by rules 1 or 2):**
    *   Calculate the average **proportion** of contributions from *other players* over the past `OBSERVATION_WINDOW` rounds.
    *   Let `actual_observation_window_size = min(OBSERVATION_WINDOW, t - 1)`. If `t-1` is 0 (i.e., `t=1`), this phase is not entered.
    *   Let `sum_other_contributions = sum of c_j for all j != i for rounds (t - actual_observation_window_size) to (t-1)`.
    *   `Avg_Proportion_Other_Contributions = sum_other_contributions / (actual_observation_window_size * (n-1))`.

    *   **If `Avg_Proportion_Other_Contributions >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD_HIGH` (e.g., 0.75):**
        *   **Action**: Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale**: Other players are contributing robustly. This is the prime opportunity to maximize personal gain by free-riding on their contributions without incurring personal cost. The public good is strong, so we extract maximum value.

    *   **Else If `Avg_Proportion_Other_Contributions >= COOPERATION_THRESHOLD_LOW` (e.g., 0.25):**
        *   **Action**: Contribute (C).
        *   **Rationale**: Cooperation levels among other players are moderate. A personal contribution here acts as a "strategic investment" or "re-engagement" to prevent the collapse of overall cooperation and encourage others to maintain their contributions. This ensures a valuable public good for future free-riding, even if it incurs a short-term cost. It's a carefully timed "bait" to keep the system productive.

    *   **Else (`Avg_Proportion_Other_Contributions < COOPERATION_THRESHOLD_LOW`):**
        *   **Action**: Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale**: Cooperation is too low to warrant a personal contribution. Contributing would likely result in a significant loss without a meaningful return from the public good. In this scenario, the strategy avoids being a "sucker" by minimizing personal cost.

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

This strategy embodies an exploitative mindset by:
*   **Creating Opportunity:** Using an initial cooperative signal (Round 1) to induce others to contribute, thereby building a public good to exploit.
*   **Opportunistic Free-Riding:** Actively defecting when other players are contributing at high levels, maximizing personal gains from their efforts without personal cost.
*   **Strategic Manipulation:** Making calculated contributions only when cooperation is at moderate levels. This isn't altruism, but a shrewd investment to prevent the collapse of the public good, ensuring future opportunities for free-riding.
*   **Loss Aversion:** Defecting when cooperation is too low to avoid being a "sucker" and minimizing personal losses when the public good is negligible.
*   **End-Game Dominance:** Unconditionally defecting in the final rounds to extract maximum value without concern for future consequences, exploiting the finite nature of the game.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_120 = '''
This strategy, named "Responsive Exploiter," aims to maximize its own payoff by strategically encouraging cooperation from others to create a "pool" of contributions, then aggressively free-riding on that pool. It adapts its behavior based on the observed cooperation levels of others and its own success, always prioritizing its individual gain.

---

### Strategy: Responsive Exploiter

**Goal:** To achieve the highest possible individual payoff by encouraging collective contributions (priming), then free-riding on others' efforts, while avoiding being a "sucker" in uncooperative environments.

**Global State (maintained across rounds):**
*   `current_coop_ratio_target`: (Float, initialized to `0.5`) Represents the minimum proportion of other players that must contribute for *this strategy* to consider defecting in the next round.
*   `rounds_of_low_payoff`: (Integer, initialized to `0`) Counts consecutive rounds where this player's payoff was too low, indicating insufficient cooperation to exploit.
*   `permanent_defect_mode`: (Boolean, initialized to `False`) A flag that, if set to `True`, causes this strategy to defect unconditionally until the last round.

**Parameters (fixed for the duration of the game):**
*   `initial_priming_rounds = min(2, r - 1)`: The number of initial rounds (up to 2, or fewer if the game is very short) where the strategy will always contribute to signal cooperativeness and try to "prime the pump." If `r=1`, this is 0.
*   `leniency_up_step = 0.05`: The amount `current_coop_ratio_target` increases when free-riding is successful.
*   `leniency_down_step = 0.15`: The amount `current_coop_ratio_target` decreases when cooperation is low, making the strategy more likely to contribute.
*   `min_payoff_for_reprime = 1.05`: If this strategy's payoff falls below this threshold, it indicates that free-riding is not sufficiently profitable, triggering the `rounds_of_low_payoff` counter. (A payoff of 1 is received if everyone, including this player, defects; a slightly higher threshold suggests that even defecting isn't yielding enough from others' contributions).
*   `reprime_rounds_threshold = 3`: The number of consecutive rounds with a payoff below `min_payoff_for_reprime` required to trigger a re-priming attempt.

---

**Decision Rules (for the current round `t`):**

1.  **Check for Permanent Defection or Last Round:**
    *   **IF `permanent_defect_mode` is `True` OR `t == r` (current round is the last round):**
        *   **Action: Defect (D).**
        *   Go to **End of Round Actions**.

2.  **First Round Logic (`t == 1`):**
    *   **IF `r == 1` (single-round game):**
        *   **Action: Defect (D).** (Dominant strategy in a single-shot game).
    *   **ELSE (`r > 1`):**
        *   **Action: Contribute (C).** (Initiate cooperation to set up future exploitation).
    *   Go to **End of Round Actions**.

3.  **Initial Priming Phase (`t > 1` AND `t <= initial_priming_rounds`):**
    *   Let `S_others_prev = sum_{j != i} c_j_{t-1}` (total contributions from other players in the previous round).
    *   **IF `S_others_prev == 0`:** (All other players defected in the previous priming round).
        *   Set `permanent_defect_mode = True`.
        *   **Action: Defect (D).** (Abandon priming; the environment is too uncooperative to justify investment).
    *   **ELSE:**
        *   **Action: Contribute (C).** (Continue to encourage cooperation).
    *   Go to **End of Round Actions**.

4.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase (`t > initial_priming_rounds` AND `t < r`):**
    *   Let `S_others_prev = sum_{j != i} c_j_{t-1}` (total contributions from other players in the previous round).
    *   `S_others_prev_ratio = S_others_prev / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Self-Correction for Low Payoff (Re-Priming Attempt):**
        *   **IF `rounds_of_low_payoff >= reprime_rounds_threshold`:**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).** (This is an investment to try and restart cooperation, because current free-riding isn't profitable enough).
            *   Reset `rounds_of_low_payoff = 0`.
            *   Reset `current_coop_ratio_target = 0.5`. (Neutralize the target to give cooperation a fresh chance).
            *   Go to **End of Round Actions**.

    *   **Primary Adaptive Decision:**
        *   **IF `S_others_prev_ratio >= current_coop_ratio_target`:**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).** (Free-ride: enough others are contributing to make defection profitable).
            *   Increase `current_coop_ratio_target`: `current_coop_ratio_target = min(0.95, current_coop_ratio_target + leniency_up_step)`. (Become more demanding before contributing next time).
        *   **ELSE (`S_others_prev_ratio < current_coop_ratio_target`):**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).** (Invest: insufficient cooperation from others; contribute to encourage more contributions for future exploitation).
            *   Decrease `current_coop_ratio_target`: `current_coop_ratio_target = max(0.05, current_coop_ratio_target - leniency_down_step)`. (Become more lenient, making it easier to contribute next time to rebuild cooperation).
    *   Go to **End of Round Actions**.

---

**End of Round Actions (after an action is taken and payoff `pi_i` for round `t` is observed, for all rounds `t < r`):**

Here is an exploitative strategy for the Public Goods Game, designed to be adaptive and robust across various opponent behaviors and game parameters.

---

**Strategy Name: Adaptive Exploiter**

This strategy aims to maximize its own payoff by encouraging others to contribute, then free-riding on their contributions. It adaptively adjusts its behavior based on the observed cooperation level of other players and the game's remaining rounds.

**Parameters:**

*   **`Initial_Coop_Rounds`**: Number of initial rounds to contribute unconditionally to establish a cooperative signal and test the waters (e.g., `1`).
*   **`Coop_Window_Size`**: Number of most recent rounds to consider when calculating the average cooperation rate of other players. This balances responsiveness and stability (e.g., `min(max(2, int(r/5)), r-1)`).
*   **`Endgame_Horizon`**: Number of rounds before the end of the game where the strategy switches to unconditional defection (e.g., `max(1, int(r/5))`).
*   **`Initial_Cooperation_Threshold`**: The starting average cooperation rate from other players required to trigger your defection (e.g., `0.6`).
*   **`Threshold_Adjustment_Factor`**: How much the `current_cooperation_threshold` adjusts in response to decisions and outcomes (e.g., `0.1`).

**Internal State:**

*   **`current_cooperation_threshold`**: A dynamic threshold that dictates when to cooperate vs. defect, initialized to `Initial_Cooperation_Threshold`.
*   **`past_others_contributions_history`**: A list storing the contribution actions of all other players in each past round.

**Decision Rules:**

For each Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):

1.  **Endgame Phase:**
    *   If `r - t < Endgame_Horizon`:
        *   **Action: Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
        *   *Rationale:* With no future interactions to incentivize cooperation, the single-round dominant strategy of defection is applied to maximize immediate payoff.

2.  **Initial Exploration Phase:**
    *   Else if `t <= Initial_Coop_Rounds`:
        *   **Action: Contribute (C)** (Contribute 1 token).
        *   *Rationale:* This initial cooperation serves as a calculated "investment." It signals a willingness to cooperate, which can encourage other players to contribute, creating a pool to free-ride on later.

3.  **Adaptive Exploitation Phase:**
    *   Else (for all other rounds in the main phase):
        *   **Calculate `average_others_cooperation_rate`:**
            *   Gather the contribution actions of all *other players* from the last `Coop_Window_Size` rounds stored in `past_others_contributions_history`.
            *   `average_others_cooperation_rate = (sum of contributions by others in the window) / (total possible contributions by others in the window)`.
            *   If no historical data is available (e.g., `t-1 < Coop_Window_Size`), treat it as 0 or the available average.

        *   **Decision:**
            *   If `average_others_cooperation_rate >= current_cooperation_threshold`:
                *   **Action: Defect (D)** (Contribute 0 tokens).
                *   *Rationale:* Other players are demonstrating sufficient cooperation for profitable free-riding.
                *   **Adjust `current_cooperation_threshold`:** Increase it by `Threshold_Adjustment_Factor` (capped at 1.0).
                *   *Exploitative Mechanism:* By raising the threshold, the strategy subtly demands even *more* cooperation from others to "earn" its contribution in the future, thus pushing them towards higher collective contributions while the strategy continues to defect.

            *   Else (`average_others_cooperation_rate < current_cooperation_threshold`):
                *   **Action: Contribute (C)** (Contribute 1 token).
                *   *Rationale:* Other players are not cooperating enough to be reliably free-ridden upon. Contributing here is an attempt to encourage a higher level of cooperation from the group, hoping to reach a point where free-riding becomes profitable again.
                *   **Adjust `current_cooperation_threshold`:** Decrease it by `Threshold_Adjustment_Factor` (floored at 0.0).
                *   *Exploitative Mechanism:* By lowering the threshold, the strategy makes it "easier" for others to meet the cooperation requirement in subsequent rounds, subtly enticing them to contribute just enough for the strategy to revert to defection.

4.  **Record History:**
    *   After taking an action, record all players' contributions for the current round into `past_others_contributions_history` for use in future calculations.

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**

*   **Opportunistic Free-Riding:** The core of the strategy is to defect whenever others are contributing, maximizing personal gain while minimizing personal cost.
*   **Adaptive Manipulation:** The dynamic `current_cooperation_threshold` is a central exploitative element. It constantly adjusts to maintain the highest possible individual payoff. It increases when the strategy successfully free-rides, pushing others to contribute more. It decreases when the strategy is "forced" to cooperate, effectively lowering the bar just enough to re-induce cooperation from others so it can resume free-riding.
*   **Endgame Ruthlessness:** The unconditional defection in the final rounds takes full advantage of the finite nature of the game, extracting maximum value when the threat of future retaliation is irrelevant.
*   **Calculated Altruism (False Signal):** The `Initial_Coop_Rounds` are not true altruism but a calculated gamble to establish a positive precedent, which, if successful, can lead to more opportunities for exploitation.

This strategy, named "The Strategic Opportunist", aims to maximize personal payoff by free-riding on others' contributions while strategically intervening to prevent the collapse of collective cooperation, thereby preserving future free-riding opportunities. It is adaptive, robust, and explicitly exploitative.

**Strategy: The Strategic Opportunist**

**Internal State Variables:**
*   `re_induce_active`: Boolean, `True` if the strategy is currently in a phase of contributing to re-induce cooperation. Initialized to `False`.
*   `re_induce_rounds_left`: Integer, counts down rounds committed to re-inducing cooperation. Initialized to `0`.

**Parameters (Dynamically set based on game parameters `n` and `r`):**
*   `r_probe_initial_cooperate`: Number of initial rounds to unconditionally contribute. Calculated as `max(1, min(3, floor(r / 4)))`. (E.g., for `r=10`, it's 2; for `r=20`, it's 3; for `r=5`, it's 1).
*   `r_endgame_defect`: Number of final rounds to unconditionally defect. Calculated as `max(1, min(2, floor(r / 5)))`. (E.g., for `r=10`, it's 2; for `r=20`, it's 2; for `r=5`, it's 1).
*   `cooperation_maintenance_threshold`: The minimum average contribution rate of all players in the previous round that is considered "healthy" enough for free-riding. Set to `0.5`.
*   `re_induce_duration`: The number of consecutive rounds to contribute when re-inducing cooperation. Set to `2`.

**Decision Rules for Round `t` (current round):**

1.  **Early Game (Initial Cooperation Phase):**
    *   **If `t <= r_probe_initial_cooperate`:**
        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
        *   **Rationale:** Establish initial goodwill and encourage conditional cooperators in the group to start contributing. This sets up a cooperative environment for future exploitation.

2.  **Endgame (Final Defection Phase):**
    *   **Else if `t > r - r_endgame_defect`:**
        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
        *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds, there are no future interactions to influence. Maximize immediate personal payoff, as any contribution would be a net loss for the current round given `k < n`.

3.  **Mid-Game (Adaptive Exploitation Phase):**
    *   **Else (for `r_probe_initial_cooperate < t <= r - r_endgame_defect`):**
        *   **Observation:** Calculate `prev_round_overall_cooperation_rate`. This is the sum of all players' contributions in round `t-1` divided by `n`. (If `t = r_probe_initial_cooperate + 1`, use the average cooperation rate from all `r_probe_initial_cooperate` rounds).

        *   **Re-induction in Progress:**
            *   **If `re_induce_active` is `True` AND `re_induce_rounds_left > 0`:**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** Continue with the pre-committed plan to re-induce cooperation, regardless of the most recent `prev_round_overall_cooperation_rate` (unless it's the very last round of the commitment).
                *   Decrement `re_induce_rounds_left`.
                *   If `re_induce_rounds_left` becomes `0`, set `re_induce_active = False`.

        *   **Evaluate and Act:**
            *   **Else if `prev_round_overall_cooperation_rate < cooperation_maintenance_threshold`:**
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Rationale:** The overall cooperation level is too low. If we continue to defect, the public good might collapse completely, leading to minimal or zero payoffs for everyone (including ourselves). This contribution is a strategic "investment" to signal cooperation and encourage others to increase their contributions, preserving the pool of resources for future free-riding.
                *   Set `re_induce_active = True`.
                *   Set `re_induce_rounds_left = re_induce_duration - 1` (since we are contributing this round).

            *   **Else (`prev_round_overall_cooperation_rate >= cooperation_maintenance_threshold`):**
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** The group's cooperation level is sufficiently high. We can afford to free-ride without risking a complete collapse of the public good. Maximize immediate personal gain by contributing nothing and still benefiting from others' contributions.

This strategy balances opportunistic free-riding with a calculated effort to maintain a minimum level of group cooperation, ensuring a sustainable environment for long-term exploitation.

This strategy, named "The Adaptive Opportunist," is designed to maximize individual payoff by strategically free-riding on others' contributions while adaptively maintaining a cooperative environment for continued exploitation. It relies solely on observed past actions and game parameters.

---

**Strategy Name:** The Adaptive Opportunist

**Internal State (persistent across rounds):**
*   `exploit_counter`: An integer, initialized to 0. This tracks the number of consecutive rounds this strategy has chosen to Defect (D) when others were cooperating sufficiently.

**Parameters (fixed values determining behavior):**
*   `exploit_limit`: An integer, typically **3 or 4**. This defines the maximum consecutive rounds the strategy will free-ride on high cooperation before it "re-seeds" cooperation by contributing.
*   `high_coop_threshold`: A proportion, typically **0.75**. If this proportion of *other* players contributed in the previous round, cooperation is considered "strong."
*   `low_coop_threshold`: A proportion, typically **0.25**. If the proportion of *other* players contributed in the previous round falls below this, cooperation is considered "weak."
*   `overall_coop_pivot`: A proportion, typically **0.5**. Used to assess the general cooperative sentiment over all past rounds when current cooperation is moderate.

**Decision Rules (for current round `t`):**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
    *   **Reasoning:** Begin by signaling a willingness to cooperate. This aims to encourage other conditional cooperators to also contribute, establishing a pool of contributions that can be exploited in subsequent rounds. Reset `exploit_counter = 0`.

2.  **Last Two Rounds (Endgame Exploitation: `t > r - 2`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Reasoning:** In the final rounds, the impact of current actions on future player behavior (reputation effects) is negligible. Maximize immediate payoff by free-riding, as there are no consequences for future rounds.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t <= r - 2`):**

    *   **Step 1: Calculate Cooperation Metrics**
        *   `previous_round_coop_rate`: Calculate the proportion of *other* players (excluding self) who contributed in the *immediately preceding round (t-1)*.
        *   `overall_avg_coop_rate`: Calculate the average proportion of *other* players (excluding self) who contributed across *all previous rounds (1 to t-1)*.

    *   **Step 2: Apply Decision Logic**

        *   **Scenario A: Strong Current Cooperation & Opportunity to Free-Ride**
            *   If `previous_round_coop_rate >= high_coop_threshold` (meaning a large majority of others contributed last round)
              *   AND `exploit_counter < exploit_limit` (we haven't free-rided too many times in a row):
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Reasoning:** Others are providing sufficient contributions, allowing for free-riding without immediately risking the collapse of cooperation. Increment `exploit_counter`.
            *   Else (i.e., `previous_round_coop_rate >= high_coop_threshold` BUT `exploit_counter >= exploit_limit`):
                *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                *   **Reasoning:** We've free-rided on strong cooperation for a few rounds. To prevent alienating these cooperators and causing them to defect (which would eliminate future exploitation opportunities), "re-seed" cooperation by contributing this round. Reset `exploit_counter = 0`.

        *   **Scenario B: Moderate or Unclear Cooperation**
            *   If `low_coop_threshold <= previous_round_coop_rate < high_coop_threshold` (meaning some, but not a large majority, contributed last round):
                *   Consider the `overall_avg_coop_rate`:
                    *   If `overall_avg_coop_rate >= overall_coop_pivot` (on average, cooperation has been reasonably high):
                        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                        *   **Reasoning:** The environment shows potential for cooperation. Contribute to encourage more contributions or maintain the current level, as it's not strong enough to confidently free-ride without risk. Reset `exploit_counter = 0`.
                    *   Else (`overall_avg_coop_rate < overall_coop_pivot`):
                        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                        *   **Reasoning:** If overall cooperation has been low, contributing might be a wasted effort. Maximize individual payoff by free-riding on any small existing contributions. Increment `exploit_counter`.

        *   **Scenario C: Weak or No Cooperation Detected**
            *   If `previous_round_coop_rate < low_coop_threshold` (meaning very few or no others contributed last round):
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Reasoning:** Others are largely defecting. Contributing would likely be a wasted effort, leading to a net loss for this strategy. Maximize individual payoff by keeping the endowment. Increment `exploit_counter`.

---
This strategy is fundamentally exploitative because its primary mode is free-riding, especially when others are cooperative. It adapts by strategically contributing only when necessary to initiate cooperation, "re-seed" it after sustained free-riding, or to encourage it in a moderate environment, thus maintaining a pool of contributions that it can exploit in subsequent rounds. It is robust to various opponent behaviors due to its dynamic thresholds and use of both recent and overall historical data.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_124 = '''
The "Calculated Instigator" Strategy

**OVERVIEW**
This strategy is designed to be highly exploitative, aiming to maximize personal payoff by predominantly free-riding on the contributions of others. It adapts to the observed level of cooperation in the group, only strategically contributing when collective cooperation is critically low to prevent total collapse of the public good, thus preserving future exploitation opportunities. The strategy prioritizes immediate gain but includes a calculated "investment" mechanism to ensure the long-term viability of a cooperative pool to exploit.

**DECISION RULES**

1.  **First Round (Round 1):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** Always begin by defecting. This immediately maximizes personal gain, establishes an exploitative stance, and allows observation of the initial cooperative inclinations of other players without any personal cost.

2.  **Last Round (Round `r`):**
    *   **Action: Defect (D).** In the final round, there are no future interactions to influence. The single-round dominant strategy of defection applies. Maximizing payoff for this round is achieved by defecting, free-riding on any remaining contributions from others.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to `r-1`):**

    *   **Information Available:**
        *   `C_prev`: The total number of contributions by *all players* in the previous round (`sum_j c_j`).

    *   **Decision Logic based on `C_prev`:**

        *   **Condition A: Complete Collapse (`C_prev = 0`)**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).** If no player contributed in the previous round, there is no public good to exploit. Contributing would be a pure loss (yielding `k/n` vs. keeping `1`). In this scenario, the strategy continues to defect, waiting for other players to unilaterally initiate cooperation before considering any contribution.

        *   **Condition B: High Exploitation Opportunity (`C_prev >= (n - 1)`)**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).** If all or almost all other players are contributing, this presents an optimal scenario for free-riding. The public good is robust, and my defection will yield `1 + (k/n) * (n-1)` while others receive `k`. This significantly contributes to my overall score at minimal risk to the collective good.

        *   **Condition C: Critical Cooperation (Threat of Collapse) (`0 < C_prev <= round(n * 0.25)`)**
            *   **Action: Contribute (C).** If the total contributions are dangerously low (e.g., 25% or less of players contributed, but not zero), the public good is at significant risk of collapsing entirely. To prevent this "tragedy of the commons" (which would eliminate all future exploitation opportunities), I will strategically contribute. This is a calculated "investment" intended to signal to other conditional cooperators that cooperation is still possible, encouraging them to contribute in subsequent rounds, thereby re-establishing a pool that I can then exploit.

        *   **Condition D: Moderate Cooperation (Default Exploitation) (All other cases, i.e., `round(n * 0.25) < C_prev < (n - 1)`)**
            *   **Action: Defect (D).** In scenarios where cooperation is moderate – neither critically low nor overwhelmingly high – the strategy defaults to defection. There is enough ongoing cooperation to benefit from, but not so much that my defection is guaranteed to be entirely inconsequential. My primary goal is exploitation, and this is the most common state where I can effectively free-ride without immediately triggering a full collective defection.

**EXPLOITATIVE ALIGNMENT**

This strategy is fundamentally exploitative because:
*   It prioritizes defection in the vast majority of situations, specifically in the first round, the last round, and whenever a moderate to high level of cooperation exists.
*   It only contributes under extreme circumstances (Condition C) as a strategic "re-investment" to ensure the survival of the public good, which it views as a resource to be exploited in future rounds. This contribution is not altruistic but purely self-serving to maintain future free-riding opportunities.
*   It is designed to capitalize on the cooperative tendencies of others, taking advantage of their contributions without reciprocating unless absolutely necessary to prevent a total shutdown of the "exploitation resource."
*   It is robust to a range of behaviors by being reactive to the overall state of the game rather than focusing on individual opponents, ensuring it performs well even against unknown or varied strategies.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_125 = '''
Here is an exploitative strategy designed for the Public Goods Game (PGG) that adapts to opponent behavior while prioritizing individual gain.

**Strategy Name: The Opportunistic Revivalist**

This strategy aims to maximize personal payoff by primarily free-riding on the contributions of others. It strategically contributes only when the overall level of cooperation is dwindling to the point where continued free-riding becomes less profitable, attempting to "revive" the collective contributions for future exploitation. It is robust to persistent defection by opponents.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: total number of players
*   `k`: multiplier (with `1 < k < n`)
*   `r`: total number of rounds

**Internal State (maintained by this player throughout the game):**
*   `my_last_contribution_round`: Stores the round number when this player last contributed (initialized to 0 before Round 1).
*   `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds`: Counts the number of consecutive rounds where the `other_cooperation_rate` (defined below) has been below `(k / n)` (initialized to 0 before Round 1).

**Decision Rules for Current Round `t` (from 1 to `r`):**

1.  **First Round (`t = 1`):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** Gather initial information about opponents' tendencies without incurring any cost. See if any players are unconditional cooperators.

2.  **Endgame Phase (`t > r - 2`, i.e., the last two rounds of the game):**
    *   **Action:** Defect (D).
    *   **Rationale:** As the game concludes, the "shadow of the future" disappears. There is no longer any incentive for players to maintain cooperation, as there are no subsequent rounds to benefit from it. Maximizing immediate payoff through defection becomes the dominant strategy.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < t <= r - 2`):**

    a.  **Calculate `other_cooperation_rate` (OCR):**
        *   Sum the contributions (`c_j_prev_round`) of all players `j` *other than myself* in the immediately preceding round (`t-1`). Let this sum be `contributions_from_others_prev_round`.
        *   `other_cooperation_rate = contributions_from_others_prev_round / (n - 1)`. This represents the proportion of other players who cooperated in the last round.

    b.  **Update `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds`:**
        *   If `other_cooperation_rate < (k / n)`: Increment `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds` by 1.
        *   Else (`other_cooperation_rate >= (k / n)`): Reset `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds` to 0.

    c.  **Decision Logic:**

        *   **Scenario 1: Sufficient Cooperation from Others:**
            *   If `other_cooperation_rate >= (k / n)`:
                *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                *   **Rationale:** The collective contributions from others are sufficiently high. This player maximizes their personal gain by free-riding on their generosity without contributing. The `k/n` threshold indicates that the public good is generating a worthwhile return, making free-riding highly profitable.

        *   **Scenario 2: Low Cooperation from Others (requiring a strategic response):**
            *   Else (`other_cooperation_rate < (k / n)`):
                *   This indicates that cooperation from others is low, reducing the potential payoff from free-riding. This strategy considers a temporary "re-investment" to revive cooperation.
                *   **Sub-Rule A: Persistent Non-Cooperation (Give Up):**
                    *   If `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds > 3`:
                        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                        *   **Rationale:** Others have consistently shown unwillingness to contribute for a prolonged period (more than 3 rounds). Further attempts to "revive" cooperation are likely futile and costly. This strategy shifts to pure self-preservation by continuously defecting to minimize losses.
                *   **Sub-Rule B: Recently Attempted Revival (Wait and Observe):**
                    *   Else if `(t - my_last_contribution_round) <= 2`:
                        *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                        *   **Rationale:** This player has contributed recently (in the previous round or two rounds ago) in an attempt to "poke" the system. It's too soon to contribute again; observe if the previous contribution had the desired effect before making another investment.
                *   **Sub-Rule C: Strategic Re-activation (Poke):**
                    *   Else (i.e., `other_cooperation_rate < (k / n)`, AND `consecutive_low_cooperation_rounds <= 3`, AND `(t - my_last_contribution_round) > 2`):
                        *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                        *   **Rationale:** This is a calculated risk. By contributing, this player attempts to signal a willingness to restore cooperation, hoping to encourage others to increase their contributions in subsequent rounds. The ultimate goal is to rebuild the collective pot to enable more profitable free-riding in the future.
                        *   **Update Internal State:** Set `my_last_contribution_round = t`.

This strategy is exploitative because it defaults to free-riding whenever possible and only contributes sparingly and strategically to manipulate others into contributing more, ensuring a larger pool from which to draw future gains. It protects against being a "sucker" by giving up on persistently uncooperative groups.

description_EXPLOITATIVE_126 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Free-Rider" (AFR), is designed to maximize individual payoff by extensively free-riding on the contributions of others, while strategically making minimal contributions only when necessary to prevent the complete collapse of the public good (and thus preserve future free-riding opportunities). It adapts to the observed level of cooperation from other players and leverages end-game effects.

**Strategy Description: Adaptive Free-Rider (AFR)**

**Game Parameters (available to the strategy):**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier for the public good.

**State Variables (maintained across rounds):**
*   `consecutive_defects_by_me`: Integer, initialized to 0. This counter tracks the number of consecutive rounds this player has chosen to Defect (D). It is reset to 0 whenever the player contributes (C).

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **First Round (`current_round == 1`):**
    *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
    *   **Rationale:** Immediately establishes an exploitative stance. It tests the willingness of other players to contribute without initial personal investment, maximizing initial free-riding.
    *   **State Update:** Increment `consecutive_defects_by_me`.

2.  **Last Rounds (End Game Horizon):**
    *   Calculate `end_game_horizon = max(1, floor(r / 5))`. This defines the final phase of the game where backward induction strongly applies (e.g., for `r=10`, last 2 rounds; for `r=20`, last 4 rounds; always at least the very last round).
    *   **Condition:** If `current_round > r - end_game_horizon`:
        *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
        *   **Rationale:** In the final rounds, there are no future consequences to incentivize cooperation. Pure defection maximizes payoff, as any contribution would be a pure loss with no expected return from sustained cooperation.
        *   **State Update:** Increment `consecutive_defects_by_me`.

3.  **Intermediate Rounds (`1 < current_round <= r - end_game_horizon`):**
    *   Let `N_others = n - 1` (number of other players).
    *   Retrieve `N_others_contrib_prev`: the count of other players who contributed (C) in the *previous* round (`current_round - 1`).

    *   **Cooperation Thresholds (tuned for robust exploitation):**
        *   `High_Coop_Threshold = ceil(N_others * 0.6)`: This signifies a healthy level of cooperation from others, making it highly profitable to free-ride.
        *   `Low_Coop_Threshold = max(1, floor(N_others * 0.2))`: This signifies a critically low level of cooperation, potentially indicating a collective collapse.

    *   **Decision Logic for Intermediate Rounds:**

        *   **A. If `N_others_contrib_prev >= High_Coop_Threshold`:**
            *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
            *   **Rationale:** When a significant portion of other players are contributing, the public good is thriving. This strategy maximizes personal gain by free-riding heavily without contributing, leveraging the generosity or strategic contributions of others.
            *   **State Update:** Increment `consecutive_defects_by_me`.

        *   **B. If `N_others_contrib_prev < Low_Coop_Threshold`:**
            *   **Condition:** If `consecutive_defects_by_me >= 3` AND `current_round < r - 2` (i.e., not immediately before the end game):
                *   **Decision:** **Contribute (C)**.
                *   **Rationale:** This is a "pump-priming" or "shock" contribution. If the public good is collapsing and this player has been a consistent defector, a single contribution might signal a willingness to cooperate *just enough* to revive some cooperation from others, thereby re-establishing a pool to free-ride from in subsequent rounds. This is a calculated investment, not an act of generosity.
                *   **State Update:** Reset `consecutive_defects_by_me = 0`.
            *   **Else (if `consecutive_defects_by_me < 3`, or it's too close to the end):**
                *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
                *   **Rationale:** If the collective is too far gone, or there's not enough game left, a single contribution is unlikely to make a meaningful difference and would just be a personal loss. It's better to preserve the token.
                *   **State Update:** Increment `consecutive_defects_by_me`.

        *   **C. Else (Intermediate Cooperation: `Low_Coop_Threshold <= N_others_contrib_prev < High_Coop_Threshold`):**
            *   **Condition:** If `consecutive_defects_by_me >= 2`:
                *   **Decision:** **Contribute (C)**.
                *   **Rationale:** This is an "exploitative flicker." If the collective is in an unstable but not collapsing state, and this player has been free-riding for a couple of rounds, a temporary contribution breaks the defection streak. This can signal to others that this player is not a permanent defector, encouraging them to maintain their contributions, which AFR will then exploit again.
                *   **State Update:** Reset `consecutive_defects_by_me = 0`.
            *   **Else (if `consecutive_defects_by_me < 2`):**
                *   **Decision:** **Defect (D)**.
                *   **Rationale:** Continue free-riding as long as it does not appear to be drastically eroding the general level of cooperation.
                *   **State Update:** Increment `consecutive_defects_by_me`.

**Exploitative Mindset Alignment:**
This strategy prioritizes individual gain through free-riding. It strategically contributes only when doing so is likely to maintain or re-establish a sufficiently large public good from which to free-ride in future rounds. It's a calculated manipulation to keep other players engaged in cooperation, not a genuine effort to contribute to collective welfare. The immediate defection, preference for defection under high cooperation, and pure defection in the end game are all hallmarks of an exploitative approach. The "contributions" are purely instrumental, designed to optimize long-term free-riding opportunities.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_127 = '''
This strategy, named "Adaptive Opportunist," aims to maximize individual payoff by exploiting the contributions of other players while strategically intervening to prevent the total collective contribution from collapsing entirely, which would diminish personal returns. It prioritizes free-riding but includes mechanisms to 're-seed' cooperation when necessary, ensuring a pool for continued exploitation.

**Game Parameters:**
*   `n`: Total number of players.
*   `r`: Total number of rounds.
*   `k`: Multiplier (1 < k < n).

**Strategy Parameters (fixed for this description, but could be dynamic):**
*   `initial_cooperate_rounds`: Sets the duration of initial cooperation. Calculated as `max(1, min(floor(r/5), 3))`. This means at least 1 round, at most 3 rounds, and scales with `r`.
*   `cooperation_threshold_high`: `0.7` - If the proportion of *other* players contributing is at or above this, it indicates strong cooperation.
*   `cooperation_threshold_low`: `0.3` - If the proportion of *other* players contributing is below this, it indicates weak cooperation or widespread defection.

**Information Used:**
*   `current_round`: The current round number (from 1 to `r`).
*   `previous_round_others_contributions`: The sum of contributions from all players *except this player* in the previous round.
*   `my_previous_contribution`: This player's own action (C or D) in the previous round.

**Adaptive Opportunist Strategy Description:**

**1. First Round (`current_round = 1`):**
   *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
   *   **Rationale (Exploitative Alignment):** In the absence of any history, contributing sets a positive example and encourages others to contribute, maximizing the initial collective pool. This establishes a baseline for observation and future exploitation.

**2. Early Exploratory Phase (`1 < current_round <= initial_cooperate_rounds`):**
   *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
   *   **Rationale (Exploitative Alignment):** Continue to invest in establishing a robust common pool. By demonstrating initial cooperation, the strategy aims to cultivate higher levels of contribution from other players, creating a larger pool to free-ride on in subsequent rounds. This phase is an investment in future exploitation.

**3. Main Adaptive Exploitation Phase (`initial_cooperate_rounds < current_round < r`):**
   *   Calculate the `average_other_contributions_rate` as `previous_round_others_contributions / (n - 1)`.

   *   **Decision Logic:**

     *   **Case A: Others are Strongly Cooperative.**
         *   If `average_other_contributions_rate >= cooperation_threshold_high`:
             *   **Action:** Defect (D).
             *   **Rationale (Exploitative Alignment):** The common pool is robustly high due to the strong contributions of other players. This is the prime opportunity to free-ride and maximize individual payoff without significantly impacting the collective contribution, as others are carrying the burden.

     *   **Case B: Others are Weakly Cooperative or Defecting.**
         *   If `average_other_contributions_rate < cooperation_threshold_low`:
             *   **Action:** Defect (D).
             *   **Rationale (Exploitative Alignment):** The collective contribution is too low, indicating widespread defection. Contributing would largely be a wasted effort, making this player a 'sucker'. Defecting minimizes losses and prevents further disadvantage.

     *   **Case C: Others are Moderately Cooperative / Responding to Fluctuations.**
         *   Else (i.e., `cooperation_threshold_low <= average_other_contributions_rate < cooperation_threshold_high`):
             *   This is a nuanced zone where the strategy seeks to maintain the common pool just enough to allow continued exploitation.
             *   **Sub-case C1: Recalibration for declining cooperation.**
                 *   If (`my_previous_contribution == D` AND `average_other_contributions_rate < cooperation_threshold_high`):
                     *   **Action:** Contribute (C).
                     *   **Rationale (Exploitative Alignment):** If this player defected in the previous round and others' contributions have subsequently dipped (but not collapsed entirely), a temporary contribution might "re-seed" cooperation. This is a strategic investment to prevent the full collapse of the pool, ensuring there's still something to exploit in future rounds. This player temporarily acts cooperatively to prevent the system from breaking down, allowing a return to exploitation.
             *   **Sub-case C2: Default to exploitation in moderate conditions.**
                 *   Otherwise (if this player contributed last round, or the drop isn't directly attributable to this player's previous defection, or the pool is stable within this moderate range):
                     *   **Action:** Defect (D).
                     *   **Rationale (Exploitative Alignment):** When conditions are moderate and not clearly strong or weak, the default is to exploit. Contribution is only a strategic maneuver to prevent collapse, not a default state.

**4. Final Round (`current_round = r`):**
   *   **Action:** Defect (D).
   *   **Rationale (Exploitative Alignment):** In the last round, there are no future interactions for reciprocity or punishment. The individual incentive to keep the token (1 unit of private good) always outweighs the individual benefit from contributing (k/n * 1), since k/n < 1. Defecting is the dominant strategy to maximize final-round payoff.
'''

description_EXPLOITATIVE_128 = '''
This strategy is designed to be highly exploitative, prioritizing individual gain by strategically free-riding on others' contributions while selectively investing to sustain the public good for future exploitation. It adapts to opponent behavior and protects against being consistently exploited itself.

### Strategy Name: Adaptive Free-Rider with Self-Preservation

**Core Principle:** Maximize personal payoff by defaulting to defection, but making calculated, minimal contributions only when necessary to prevent the collapse of the public good (thereby preserving free-riding opportunities) or to induce greater cooperation from others. It is designed to avoid being a "sucker" against persistent defectors.

---

**Decision Rules:**

1.  **Round 1 (Initial Probe):**
    *   **Action: Contribute (c_i = 1).**
    *   **Rationale:** This is an initial investment designed to signal a willingness to cooperate. It serves to "test the waters" and potentially induce other players to contribute, creating a pool that can be exploited in subsequent rounds.

2.  **Intermediate Rounds (Rounds 2 to r-1):**
    *   In each intermediate round, analyze the history of the *previous* round's contributions from other players.
    *   Let `N_others_cooperated_last_round` be the total count of players (excluding yourself) who contributed `c_j=1` in the immediately preceding round.
    *   Calculate the proportion of other players who cooperated: `P_others_cooperated = N_others_cooperated_last_round / (n - 1)`.

    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If `N_others_cooperated_last_round == 0` (No one else cooperated):**
            *   **Action: Defect (c_i = 0).**
            *   **Rationale:** If no other player contributed in the previous round, it indicates a strong tendency towards defection from the group, or that they are all "Always Defect" strategists. Contributing in this scenario would make me a "sucker." I immediately cease all contributions to protect my own endowment, as there's no collective good to effectively free-ride on.
        *   **Else (If `N_others_cooperated_last_round > 0`):**
            *   **If `P_others_cooperated >= 0.5` (A majority or half of others cooperated):**
                *   **Action: Defect (c_i = 0).**
                *   **Rationale:** The collective good is sufficiently maintained by the contributions of others. I can safely free-ride on their efforts, maximizing my personal gain without contributing. This is the primary exploitative mode.
            *   **Else (If `0 < P_others_cooperated < 0.5`, i.e., some cooperated, but less than half):**
                *   **Action: Contribute (c_i = 1).**
                *   **Rationale:** Cooperation is present but fragile. My contribution serves as a calculated investment to "resuscitate" or boost the public good, hoping to encourage more contributions from others in future rounds. This is a temporary measure to prevent the system from collapsing into universal defection, thereby preserving future free-riding opportunities when `P_others_cooperated` hopefully rises above 0.5.

3.  **Round r (Last Round):**
    *   **Action: Defect (c_i = 0).**
    *   **Rationale:** In the final round, there are no future interactions for reciprocity, inducement, or maintaining a reputation. The game effectively becomes a single-shot interaction, where defection is the dominant and individually optimal strategy, regardless of what others do.
